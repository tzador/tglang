;; This is a function that recursively calculates the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n) ;; defines the function name and its parameter
  (if (<= n 1) ;; checks if n is less than or equal to 1
      1 ;; returns 1 as the base case for factorial
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ;; multiplies n with the result of calling the function again with n-1 as the parameter

(format t "Enter a number to calculate its factorial: ") ;; prompts the user for input
;; (t) designates the standard output stream
(setq num (read)) ;; assigns user's input to the variable num using (setq var value) syntax

(format t "Factorial of ~d = ~d" num (factorial num)) ;; prints the result using the ~d format specifier to represent integers
;; ~d is followed by two arguments, num and the result of calling the factorial function with num as the argument
