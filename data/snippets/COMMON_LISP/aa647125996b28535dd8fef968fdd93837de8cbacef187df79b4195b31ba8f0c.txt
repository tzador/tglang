(defun factorial (n) ; Defines a function named factorial which takes in a parameter n
  (if (equal n 0) ; Checks if n is equal to 0, if yes, returns 1
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; If n is not equal to 0, recursively multiplies n with the factorial of n-1 and returns the result

(print (factorial 6)) ; Prints the factorial of 6, which is 720

; Output: 720
