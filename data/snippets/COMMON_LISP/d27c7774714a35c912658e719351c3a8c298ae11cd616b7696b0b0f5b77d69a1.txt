;; An example of a function that takes in a list and returns its length

(defun list-length (lst)
  "Returns the length of the given list lst"
  (if (null lst) ;; base case: if list is empty, length is 0
      0 
      (+ 1 (list-length (rest lst)))) ;; recursive case: add 1 to the length of the rest of the list
