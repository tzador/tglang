;The fibonacci function takes in an argument n.
;The function creates an internal function fib that takes in a, b and count as arguments.
;The count is used to keep track of the number of elements in the sequence that have been generated.
;If the count is less than or equal to 0, then an empty list is returned.
;Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself, with the next two elements in the sequence, and decreases the count by 1.
;The base case for the recursion is reached when count is equal to 0.
;The function then returns a list with a as the first element and calls fib again with b as the first element and the sum of a and b as the second element, and the count decreased by 1.
;The function is called recursively until the base case is reached, and then the final list of fibonacci numbers up to n is returned.
;Examples:
;(fibonacci 5) -> (0 1 1 2 3)
;(fibonacci 8) -> (0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13)

;Output:
(fibonacci 10) -> (0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34)
