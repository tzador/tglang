;; Define a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n)  ; Define the function 
  (if (= n 0)  ; Check if the number is equal to 0
      1 ; If yes, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; If not, multiply the number with the factorial of n-1
  )
)

;; Call the factorial function with the number 5 and print the result
(print (factorial 5)) ; Prints 120 as the factorial of 5 is 120
