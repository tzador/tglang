;; Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n)
       (if (<= n 1) ; check if number is less than or equal to 1
              1 ; return 1 if number is 1 or less
         (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; recursively multiply number by the factorial of n-1
(print (factorial 5)) ; print the factorial of 5, which should be 120 

;; Output: 120
