(let* ((list (list 1 2 3 4))) ; declares a let expression with a locally scoped variable list, assigns a list with values 1, 2, 3, 4
  (loop for x in list       ; begins a loop that will iterate through each element of the list
        when (evenp x)      ; for each iteration, checks if the current element is even
        collect (* x x)))   ; if the element is even, adds it to a new list created by multiplying the element by itself 
; Output: (4 16)
