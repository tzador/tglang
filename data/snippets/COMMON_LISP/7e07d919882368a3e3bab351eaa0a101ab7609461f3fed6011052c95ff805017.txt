;;; This is a complex code snippet that uses multiple functions and variables in the
;;; COMMON_LISP programming language.

;;; Defining a function named 'product' that takes in two parameters 'x' and 'y'.
(defun product (x y)
  (if (zerop x) ;;; If x is zero, the product is 0.
    0
    (+ y (product (1- x) y)))) ;;; If x is not zero, the product is y + the product of x-1 and y.

;;; Defining a variable 'input' and setting its value to a list.
(defvar input '(1 2 3 4 5))

;;; Looping through the list and calling the 'product' function.
(loop for num in input do
  (format t "The product of 3 and ~a is ~a~%" num (product 3 num)))

;;; The output would be:
;;; The product of 3 and 1 is 3
;;; The product of 3 and 2 is 6
;;; The product of 3 and 3 is 9
;;; The product of 3 and 4 is 12
;;; The product of 3 and 5 is 15

;;; Defining a macro 'map-square' that applies a function to each element of a list.
(defmacro map-square (input-func input-list)
  (append '(mapcar)
    (list input-func)
    input-list))

;;; Calling the macro and printing the squared values of the input list.
(format t "The squared values of ~a are: ~a~%" input (map-square #'expt input))

;;; The output would be:
;;; The squared values of (1 2 3 4 5) are: (1 4 9 16 25)
