;;;;; This is a long and complex code snippet in COMMON_LISP that creates a function named "calculate_average" that takes in a list of numbers and returns the average value.
;;;;; It uses recursion to iterate through the list and adds up all the numbers to calculate the total sum.
;;;;; It then uses the length function to find the number of elements in the list and divides the sum by the length to get the average. 
;;;;; Lastly, it uses format function to print the result in a easily readable format.

(defun calculate_average (numbers)
  "Function to calculate average of a list of numbers"
  (if (null numbers)
      0
      (let* ((sum (+ (car numbers) (calculate_average (cdr numbers))))
             (length (length numbers)))
        (format t "The average of ~s is ~,2f~%" numbers (/ sum length)))))
