;; This function takes in two lists as parameters and uses recursion to compare each element in the lists.
;; If the first list is empty, it returns the second list.
;; If the second list is empty, it returns the first list.
;; If the first element in the first list is smaller than the first element in the second list,
;; it adds that element to the merged list and recursively calls the function with the rest of the first list and the second list.
;; If the opposite is true, it adds the first element in the second list to the merged list and recursively calls the function with the first list and the rest of the second list.
