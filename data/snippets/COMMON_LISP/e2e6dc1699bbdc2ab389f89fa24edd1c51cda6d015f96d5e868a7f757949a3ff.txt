(defun iterative-gcd (a b) ; Defines a function named "iterative-gcd" that takes two parameters: a and b.
  (if (= b 0) ; Checks if b is equal to 0.
      a ; If b is equal to 0, return a.
      (iterative-gcd b (mod a b)) ; If b is not equal to 0, recursively call the function with b as the first parameter and the remainder of a divided by b as the second parameter.
      )

(format t "Enter first number: ") ; Prints the string "Enter first number: ".
(setf num1 (read)) ; Takes user input and assigns it to the variable num1.
(format t "Enter second number: ") ; Prints the string "Enter second number: ".
(setf num2 (read)) ; Takes user input and assigns it to the variable num2.

(format t "The GCD of ~d and ~d is ~d." num1 num2 (iterative-gcd num1 num2)) ; Prints the string "The GCD of (value of num1) and (value of num2) is (return value of iterative-gcd function)."
