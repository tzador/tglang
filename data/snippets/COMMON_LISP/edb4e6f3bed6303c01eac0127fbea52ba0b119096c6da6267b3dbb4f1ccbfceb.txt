(defun factorial (n)    ; this is a function definition, defines a function named factorial with a parameter n
  (if (< n 2)           ; if statement checking if n is less than 2
      1                 ; if n is less than 2, return 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; if n is not less than 2, multiply n with the result of factorial function called recursively with n-1 as the parameter
(format t "Enter a number: ") ; output message to enter a number
(let ((num (read)))           ; read in a number and store it in the variable num
  (format t "The factorial of ~a is ~a" num (factorial num))) ; output the factorial of num using the factorial function
