;; Explanation:
;; The first line defines a function called `generate-complex-list` that takes in one parameter, `n`.
;; The `if` statement checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, an empty list is returned.
;; Otherwise, using the `append` function, the recursive function calls itself with `n` decremented by 1 and appends a randomly generated number between 1 and `n` (using the `random` function) to the end of the list.
;; Finally, the function is called with a value of 10 for `n` and the generated list is output.
