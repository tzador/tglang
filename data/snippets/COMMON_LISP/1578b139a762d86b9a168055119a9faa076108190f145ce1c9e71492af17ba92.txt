;;; This code snippet is a recursive program that calculates the factorial of a number

(defun factorial (n) ;; defines a function named factorial with one parameter n
  (if (= n 0) ;; checks if n is equal to 0
      1 ;; returns 1 as the base case of the factorial function
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ;; multiplies n with the factorial of n-1 and recursively calls the function
      )
  )

(format t "Enter a number to calculate its factorial: ") ;; prints a message to the console
(let ((num (parse-integer (read-line)))) ;; prompts the user to enter a number and parses it into an integer
  (format t "Factorial of ~d is ~d." num (factorial num)) ;; prints the factorial of the entered number
  )
