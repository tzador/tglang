  (if (<= n 1) 1 ;; Checks if n is less than or equal to 1, if yes returns 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))) ;; If n is greater than 1, multiplies n with factorial of n - 1
(format t "Enter a number: ") ;;; Outputs the string "Enter a number: "
(setq num (read)) ;;; Sets the variable num to user input using the read function
(format t "Factorial of ~a is ~a~%" num (factorial num)) ;;; Outputs the string "Factorial of (input number) is (factorial of input number)"
