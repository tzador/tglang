(defun recursive-fib (n)
  "Function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number recursively."
  (if (= n 0)
    0 ;; Base case: the 0th Fibonacci number is 0.
    (if (= n 1)
      1 ;; Base case: the 1st Fibonacci number is 1.
    (+ (recursive-fib (- n 1)) (recursive-fib (- n 2))))) ;; Recursive case: return the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers.

; Example usage: (recursive-fib 5) outputs 5
