(defun check-prime (num) ;This defines a function named "check-prime" which accepts one parameter
  (let ((limit (sqrt num))) ;This creates a local variable named "limit" and assigns the square root of the parameter to it
   (loop for i from 2 to limit by 1 ;This creates a loop that starts from 2 and increments by 1 until it reaches the limit
         when (zerop (mod num i)) do (return nil) ;This checks if the remainder of the parameter divided by the current loop variable is zero, if yes, it returns nil which means the number is not a prime number
     finally (return t)))) ;If the loop finishes without returning nil, then the number is a prime number and the function returns true
