;;This code snippet uses recursion to find the factorial of a number
;;Input: n (number)
;;Output: Factorial of n
(defun factorial (n) ; Create a function named "factorial" that takes in one argument, n
  (if (= n 1) ; Check if n is equal to 1 using the "=" operator
    1 ; If n is equal to 1, return 1 as the factorial is 1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; If n is not equal to 1, recursively call the factorial function with n-1 and multiply it with n
