;; Define a function that takes in two lists and returns the intersection of the two lists
(defun intersection (list1 list2)
  "Returns the intersection of two lists, list1 and list2"
  (let (result)
    (dolist (element list1 result)
      (when (member element list2)
        (pushnew element result)))) 
        ; checks if element in list1 is also in list2 and adds it to the result list
    result) ; returns the list of elements that are common in both list1 and list2

;; Sample function call
(intersection '(1 2 3 4 5) '(3 4 5 6 7))

;; Output:
(3 4 5) ; returns the intersection of the two lists, in this case, the elements 3, 4, 5 are common in both lists
