;; This code snippet creates a function that takes in a list of numbers,
;; and calculates the mean of those numbers.
(defun calculate-mean (numbers)    ; Defining a function with one parameter 'numbers'
    (let ((sum 0))                 ; Defining a local variable 'sum' and setting it to 0
        (dolist (num numbers)      ; Looping through the list of numbers
            (setf sum (+ sum num))) ; Adding each number to the sum variable
        (let ((count (length numbers)))  ; Defining a local variable 'count' to store the length of the list
            (/ sum count))))              ; Calculating the mean by dividing the sum by the count
