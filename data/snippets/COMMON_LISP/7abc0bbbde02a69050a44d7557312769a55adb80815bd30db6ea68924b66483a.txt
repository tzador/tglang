;; Define a function that takes in two parameters, `num1` and `num2`,
;; and returns the sum of the two numbers

(defun add-two-nums (num1 num2)
  "Function that takes in two numbers and returns the sum of the two"
  (+ num1 num2))

;; Set a default value of 0 for `num2`
 
(defun add-two-nums (num1 &optional (num2 0))
  "Function that takes in two numbers and returns the sum of the two"
  (+ num1 num2))
  
;; Create a list of numbers and map the function over the list
 
(let ((numbers '(1 2 3 4)))
  (mapcar #'add-two-nums numbers))

;; Output: (1 2 3 4)
