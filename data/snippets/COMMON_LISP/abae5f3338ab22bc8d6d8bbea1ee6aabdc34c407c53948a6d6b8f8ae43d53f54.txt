;; Defining a function "bubble-sort" that takes in a list of numbers and sorts them in ascending order

(defun bubble-sort (list)
  (let ((length (length list))
        (swapped t))
    (loop while swapped
          for i below (1- length)
          do (setf swapped nil)
             (loop for j from 0 to (- length i 2)
                   do (when (> (nth j list) (nth (1+ j) list))
                        (rotatef (nth j list)
                                 (nth (1+ j) list))
                        (setf swapped t))))
    list))

;; Example usage:

(bubble-sort '(8 2 5 1 4))

;; Output:
(1 2 4 5 8)
