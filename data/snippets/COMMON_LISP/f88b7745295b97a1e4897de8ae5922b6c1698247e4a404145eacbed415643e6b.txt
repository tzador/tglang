;;; An example of using the functions to perform calculations
;;; We call the SUM function to calculate the sum of 5 and 10
(sum 5 10) 
;;; => 15

;;; We call the DIFFERENCE function to calculate the difference between 20 and 10
(difference 20 10) 
;;; => 10

;;; We call the PRODUCT function to calculate the product of 3 and 7
(product 3 7) 
;;; => 21

;;; We call the QUOTIENT function to calculate the quotient of 100 and 5
(quotient 100 5) 
;;; => 20

;;; We call the SQUARE-ROOT function to calculate the square root of 25
(square-root 25) 
;;; => 5
