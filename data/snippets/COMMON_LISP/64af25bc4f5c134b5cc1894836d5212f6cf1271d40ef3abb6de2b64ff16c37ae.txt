;; This code snippet defines a function named "sum-n-nums"
;; It takes in a list of numbers and outputs the sum of all the numbers in the list
(defun sum-n-nums (nums)

  ;; This variable "sum" will store the total sum 
  (let ((sum 0))

    ;; This loop iterates through each number in the list and adds it to the "sum" variable
    (loop for num in nums do
      (setf sum (+ sum num)))
  
    ;; Once the loop is finished, the final sum is returned as output
    sum))
    
;; Example usage of the function
(sum-n-nums '(1 2 3 4 5))
;; Output: 15
