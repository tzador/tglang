;;; This is a code snippet demonstrating a function that performs binary search on a sorted list.

(defun binary-search (list target)
  "Performs binary search on a sorted list and returns the index of the target element if found, otherwise returns nil."
  (let ((low 0)
        (high (1- (length list))))
    (when (>= high low)
      (let ((mid (floor (+ high low) 2)))
        (cond ((= (nth mid list) target) mid)
              ((< (nth mid list) target)
               (binary-search (subseq list (1+ mid)) target))
              (t (binary-search (subseq list 0 mid) target))))))

;;; Usage: (binary-search '(1 2 3 4 5) 4)
;;; Output: 3
