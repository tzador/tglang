(defun factorial (n)  ; defines a function named factorial that takes in a parameter n
  (if (<= n 1)       ; checks if n is less than or equal to 1
      1               ; returns 1 if n is less than or equal to 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))) ; multiplies n with the result of calling factorial again with n-1 as the parameter
