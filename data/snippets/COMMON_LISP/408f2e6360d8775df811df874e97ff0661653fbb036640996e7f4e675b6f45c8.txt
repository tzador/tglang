  total)

; This code snippet uses the `let` and `dolist` functions in Common Lisp to create a variable `numbers` with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
; Then, it creates a variable `total` and sets it to 0.
; The `dolist` function loops through each element in the `numbers` list and adds it to the `total` variable.
; Finally, the `total` variable is returned as the output of the code snippet.
