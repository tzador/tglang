;;Defining a function that checks if a number is prime
(defun prime-check (x)
	"Checks if X is a prime number."
	(if (< x 2) ;if X is less than 2, it is not prime
		nil ;return NIL
		(loop for i from 2 to (isqrt x) ;;loop from 2 to the square root of X 
			when (zerop (mod x i)) ;if the remainder of X divided by I is zero, it is not prime
			return nil ;return NIL
			finally (return t)))) ;if none of the conditions above were satisfied, return T as it is prime
	
;;Using the function to check if a list of numbers are prime
(loop for num in '(2 5 13 20 27 31 41)
	collect (list num (prime-check num)))

;; Output:
;;((2 T) (5 T) (13 T) (20 NIL) (27 NIL) (31 T) (41 T))
