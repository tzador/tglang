;;; This is a function that takes in two numbers and returns their sum

(defun sum (num1 num2) ;;; Define a function called 'sum'
  (let ((result (+ num1 num2))) ;;; Use a 'let' binding to store the result of adding num1 and num2 in a variable called 'result'
    (format t "The sum of ~a and ~a is ~a" num1 num2 result))) ;;; The 'format' function prints the sum in a string along with the input numbers
[2 5 7
 ;; Call the function with input numbers 2 and 5 and store the output in a variable called 'answer'
(format nil "[2 5 7; the sum of ~a and ~a is ~a]" 2 5 (sum 2 5))

; Output:
; "[2 5 7; the sum of 2 and 5 is 7]"
