;; This function takes in a list (lst) and a value (val)
;; and inserts the value at a random position in the list.
;; If the random position is at the beginning of the list,
;; the value is added using the cons function.
;; Otherwise, the list is split at the random position
;; and the value is added in between the two resulting lists.
;; The resulting list is returned as output.
