(defun generate-squares (n)
  "Creates a list of squares from 1 through n"
  (loop for i from 1 to n collect (* i i)))
  ;; The above loop creates a list of squares starting from 1 and ending at n.
  ;; The function takes in an integer n as a parameter.
  ;; The function is called using (generate-squares n) where n is the desired limit for the squares.
  ;; Example: (generate-squares 5) will output (1 4 9 16 25) as a list.
  ;; The output is a list of squares with length n.
