;; Here is a simple example of a function in COMMON_LISP.
(defun calculate-factorial (n)
  "Returns the factorial of a given number n. Takes in an integer as input."
  (if (< n 0)                       ; Check if n is negative.
      (error "Cannot calculate factorial of negative number.")
      (if (= n 0)                   ; Check if n is equal to 0.
          1                         ; If so, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1.
          (* n (calculate-factorial (- n 1)))))) ; If not, recursively call the function to calculate factorial.

;; This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number.
;; It takes in a positive integer n as input and returns the factorial of n as output.

;; Example usage:
(calculate-factorial 5) ; Output: 120
