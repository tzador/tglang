(defmacro parallel-map (binding form &rest body)
  "A macro to run forms in parallel using multiple threads.
  
  * `binding` can be either `let` or `let*` bindings.
  
  * `form` can be any form that returns a sequence.

The threads created by this macro do not need exclusive access to objects
accessed by the forms. This means that, for optimal performance, these forms
should perform mostly local computation and avoid modifying shared data.

Note that this macro does *not* guarantee parallelism other than by using
multiple threads. That is, if `form` always returns a sequence with only one
element, then the forms will be processed in sequence.

If `form` can contain objects that change value, then read and write protections
must be used if the computation is to be performed correctly.
