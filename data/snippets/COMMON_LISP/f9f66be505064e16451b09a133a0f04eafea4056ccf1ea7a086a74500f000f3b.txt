;; this code snippet defines a function called 'calculate-factorial'
;; that takes in a positive integer 'n' and returns the factorial of 'n'.

(defun calculate-factorial (n)
  "Calculates the factorial of a given positive integer 'n'."
  (if (<= n 1) 1  ;; if n is less than or equal to 1, return 1
      (* n (calculate-factorial (- n 1)))  ;; otherwise, multiply n by the factorial of n-1
  )
)

;; this code snippet calls the function 'calculate-factorial' and prints the result
(format t "5 factorial is ~d~%" (calculate-factorial 5)) ;; => 5 factorial is 120
