;;;; This is a code snippet for finding the mode of a list of numbers using the "hash table" data structure in Common Lisp.

;; Define a function called "find-mode" that takes in a list as its only parameter.
(defun find-mode (list)
  ;; Create an empty hash table using the function "make-hash-table" with the default value 0.
  (let ((hash-table (make-hash-table :test 'equal :test-not 'equal :size (1+ (length list)) :rehash-size 1.5 :rehash-threshold 0.7 :rehash-size-threshold 3)))
    ;; Loop through the input list and for each element, check if it exists as a key in the hash table.
    ;; If it does, increment its value by 1, otherwise add it to the hash table with a value of 1.
    (dolist (element list)
      (if (gethash element hash-table)
        (setf (gethash element hash-table) (+ 1 (gethash element hash-table)))
        (setf (gethash element hash-table) 1)))
    ;; Define variables "max" and "mode" to track the maximum frequency and corresponding mode.
    ;; Loop through all the elements in the hash table and update "max" and "mode" accordingly.
    (let ((max 0)
          (mode nil))
      (maphash (lambda (key value)
                 (if (> value max)
                   (progn (setf max value) (setf mode key))))
               hash-table)
      ;; Finally, return the mode.
