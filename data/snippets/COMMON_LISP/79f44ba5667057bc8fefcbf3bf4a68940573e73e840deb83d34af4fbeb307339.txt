;; This code snippet shows an example of a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n) ; defining a function with one parameter
  (if (= n 0) ; checking if the number is equal to 0
      1 ; if yes, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))) ; if not, multiply the number with the factorial of the preceding number
