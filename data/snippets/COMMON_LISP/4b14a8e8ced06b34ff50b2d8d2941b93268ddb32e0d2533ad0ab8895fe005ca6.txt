;; This code uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

(defun factorial (number) ; Defines the function 'factorial' which takes in a parameter 'number'
  (if (= number 0) ; Checks if the number is equal to 0
      1 ; If yes, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
      (* number (factorial (- number 1))))) ; If not, multiplies the number with the factorial of the number minus 1 and repeats the process until the number reaches 0.

(factorial 6) ; Calls the function with the value 6 as the parameter, output: 720
