`(defun fibonacci (n) ;Defines a function named "fibonacci" that takes in one argument, "n"
  (if (= n 0) ;Checks if "n" is equal to 0, the base case for the recursive function
      0 ;If "n" is equal to 0, returns 0
      (if (= n 1) ;Checks if "n" is equal to 1, another base case for the recursive function
          1 ;If "n" is equal to 1, returns 1
          (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))))) ;If "n" is not equal to 0 or 1, recursively calls "fibonacci" function with arguments "n-1" and "n-2" and adds the results together, returning the nth Fibonacci number
