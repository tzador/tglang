;;This is a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

(defun fibonacci (n) ;;Defines a function called fibonacci that takes in a parameter n
  (if (<= n 1) n ;;Checks if n is less than or equal to 1, if it is return n
      (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2))))) ;;If n is greater than 1, recursively call fibonacci on n-1 and n-2 and add them together

;;This code is to test the fibonacci function by printing the first 10 numbers in the sequence

(format t "The first ~a numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:~%" 10) ;;Prints a message in the console
(dotimes (i 10) ;;Loops 10 times, each time assigning the index to i
  (format t "~a " (fibonacci i))) ;;Prints the result of calling fibonacci on i and adds a space between each number
