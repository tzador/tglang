;; Function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion
(defun factorial (n)
    "Calculate the factorial of n using recursion."
    ;; Base case: if n is 0, return 1
    (if (equal n 0)
        1
        ;; Recursive case: multiply n by the factorial of (n-1)
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
