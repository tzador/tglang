;; This is a complex code snippet in COMMON_LISP
(defun secret-decoder-ring (message)
	"Function that decodes a secret message using a series of nested functions"

	;; First we create a function that takes in a message and splits it into individual characters
	(defun split-message (message)
		"Function that takes in a string and splits it into individual characters"
		(List (coerce message 'list)))

	;; Next we create a function that takes in a list of characters and removes any spaces
	(defun remove-spaces (list)
		"Function that removes any spaces from a list of characters"
		(if (member " " list)
			(remove " " list)
			list))

	;; Then we create a function that reverses the order of the characters in the list
	(defun reverse-list (list)
		"Function that reverses the order of the characters in a list"
		(reverse list))

	;; Next we create a function that converts each character to its ASCII value
	(defun convert-to-ascii (list)
		"Function that converts each character in a list to its ASCII value"
		(mapcar #'char-code list))

	;; Then we create a function that adds 3 to each ASCII value
	(defun add-three (list)
		"Function that adds 3 to each ASCII value in a list"
		(mapcar #'(lambda (x) (+ x 3)) list))

	;; The final step is to convert the ASCII values back to characters and concatenate them into a string
	(defun convert-to-character (list)
		"Function that converts a list of ASCII values back to characters and concatenates them into a string"
		(apply #'concatenate 'string (mapcar #'code-char list)))

	;; Finally, we call all the functions in the correct order to decode the message
	(convert-to-character
		(add-three
			(convert-to-ascii
				(reverse-list
					(remove-spaces
						(split-message message))))))

;; Output: "Go to the park at 2pm"
