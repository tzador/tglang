;; This program calculates the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n) ; defines a function called 'factorial' with parameter 'n'
  (if (= n 1) ; if n is equal to 1
      1 ; then, return 1 as the factorial of 1 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))) ; else, multiply n with the factorial of (n-1) and recurse until n = 1
	  
;; Example usage
(print (factorial 6)) ; prints the factorial of 6 to the console, which is 720
