;; This is a code snippet in Common Lisp, it generates a fibonacci sequence
(let ((a 0) (b 1) (c 1)) ; define variables a, b, c to store sequence numbers
  (dotimes (n 15) ; iterate 15 times to generate 15 numbers in the sequence
    (format t "~D: ~D~%" n a) ; print the number and its position in the sequence
    (setq c (+ a b)) ; calculate the next number in the sequence
    (setq b a) ; assign the current number to the previous number
    (setq a c))) ; assign the next number to the current number
