(defun fibonacci (n) ; Defines a function named "fibonacci" that takes one parameter, n.
  (if (< n 2) ; Checks if n is less than 2.
      n ; If n is less than 2, returns n as the result.
      (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2))) ; If n is greater than or equal to 2, recursively calls the function with two arguments: n-1 and n-2, and adds the results together.
