;; This code uses recursion to calculate the Fibonacci sequence
(defun fib (x) ; Define a function named "fib"
  (if (= x 0) ; If x is equal to 0
    0 ; Return 0
    (if (= x 1) ; If x is equal to 1
      1 ; Return 1
      (+ (fib (- x 1)) (fib (- x 2)))))) ; Otherwise, return the sum of the two previous numbers in the sequence

;; This code uses a do loop to print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
(do ((n 1 (+ n 1))) ; Set up a do loop with n starting at 1 and incrementing by 1 each time
  ((> n 10) t) ; Loop until n is greater than 10, set t to exit the loop
  (write-line (format nil "~d: ~d" n (fib n)))) ; Print the number and its corresponding Fibonacci number, formatted as a string
