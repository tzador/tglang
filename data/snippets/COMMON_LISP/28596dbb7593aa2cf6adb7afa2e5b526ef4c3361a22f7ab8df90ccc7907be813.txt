;;; A function to calculate the factorial of a number
;;; Takes in a positive integer and returns its factorial
;;; Uses recursion to calculate the factorial

(defun factorial (x)   ;;; Defines the function named "factorial" with a parameter x
  (if (= x 0)          ;;; Checks if the value of x is equal to 0
      1                ;;; If true, returns 1 as 0! = 1
      (* x (factorial (- x 1))))) ;;; If false, multiplies x with the factorial of (x - 1)

(factorial 5)         ;;; Calls the function with the value 5 and prints its factorial (120)
