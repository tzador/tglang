;;This code snippet creates a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number.
;;It takes in one parameter, the number whose factorial is to be calculated.
(defun factorial (n) 
  ;;the base case, if n is less than or equal to 1, return 1
  (if (<= n 1) 
    1 
    ;;otherwise, call the factorial function on n-1 and multiply it by n
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) 

;;example
(factorial 5) ;;returns 120, since factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
