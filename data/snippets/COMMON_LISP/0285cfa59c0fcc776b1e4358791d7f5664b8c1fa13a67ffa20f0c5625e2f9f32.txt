;; Function to calculate the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n)
  "Calculates the factorial of the given number n"
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
;; Example usage:
(factorial 5) ;returns 120
;; Output explanation:
;; This code snippet defines a function called factorial that takes in a parameter n.
;; Inside the function, an if statement checks if the value of n is less than or equal to 1.
;; If it is, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it multiplies n with the factorial of n-1 using recursion.
;; This recursion continues until n reaches a value of 1, and the function returns the final calculated value.
;; The last line of the code snippet shows an example usage of the function, where 5 is passed in as the value for n.
;; The output of this function call would be 120, as 5! (factorial of 5) is equal to 120.
