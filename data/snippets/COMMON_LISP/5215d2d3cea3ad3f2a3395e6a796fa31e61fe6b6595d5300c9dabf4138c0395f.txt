;; Method to calculate the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n)
    "Calculates the factorial of a given number"
    (if (= n 0)                         ; If the number is 0, then the factorial is 1
        1                               ; Return 1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))     ; Otherwise multiply n with the factorial of n-1

(factorial 5)                           ; Output: 120, since 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
