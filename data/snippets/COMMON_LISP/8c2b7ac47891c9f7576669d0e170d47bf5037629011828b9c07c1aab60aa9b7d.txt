;; Define a function that takes in a list, doubles every number in the list, 
;; and returns a new list with the doubled numbers.

(defun double-numbers (lst)
  "Function to double every number in a list."
  (if (null lst) ; Base case, empty list
      nil
      (let ((new-list (cons (* 2 (car lst)) ; Double the first element of the list
                            nil))) ; Initialize a new list with the doubled element
        (dolist (elem (cdr lst)) ; Loop through the rest of the list
          (setf new-list (append new-list (list (* 2 elem))))) ; Add the doubled element to the new list
        new-list))) ; Return the new list

;; EXAMPLE:
(double-numbers '(1 2 3 4 5)) ; Returns (2 4 6 8 10)
