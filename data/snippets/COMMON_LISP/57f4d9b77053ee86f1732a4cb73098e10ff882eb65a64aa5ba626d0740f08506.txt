; This function uses the loop and let syntax to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
; It first initializes variables 'a' and 'b' to 0 and 1 respectively
; Then, it uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 0 to n
; During each iteration, it updates the value of 'a' to the sum of 'a' and 'b'
; Finally, it returns the value of 'a', which is the nth Fibonacci number
