;; This code defines a higher-order function that takes in a list of numbers and returns a list
;; of their squares with the respective indices.

(defun square-numbers (numbers)
  "Takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of their squares with indices"
  (mapcar #'(lambda (num idx)
              (list idx (* num num)))

;; Example usage:
(square-numbers '(2 3 4 5 6)) ; returns ((0 4) (1 9) (2 16) (3 25) (4 36))
