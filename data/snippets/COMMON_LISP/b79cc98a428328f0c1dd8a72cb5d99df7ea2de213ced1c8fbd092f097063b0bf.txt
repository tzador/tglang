(defparameter *list-of-numbers* '(1 2 3 4 5)) ; defines a global variable called *list-of-numbers* which is a list of numbers 1 through 5

; function that takes in a list and returns the average of all the numbers in the list
(defun average (list)
  (if (null list) ; checks if the list is empty
      (error "List is empty") ; if the list is empty, throws an error
      (/ (reduce #'+ list) (length list)))) ; if the list is not empty, reduces the list by adding all elements together and then divides by the length of the list to get the average

(format t "The average of ~a is ~a" *list-of-numbers* (average *list-of-numbers*)) ; prints out the average of the list of numbers using the format function which takes in a string with placeholders (~a) and then the values to fill in those placeholders

; output:
; The average of (1 2 3 4 5) is 3
