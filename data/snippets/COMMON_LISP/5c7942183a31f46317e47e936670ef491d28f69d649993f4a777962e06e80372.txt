;; Define a function that takes in a list and returns the list reversed
(defun reverse-list (list)
  (if (null list)           ; if list is empty
      nil                   ; return nil
      (append (reverse-list (cdr list)) ; call function recursively on rest of list
              (list (car list)))))     ; and append current element to reversed list
              
;; Example usage
(reverse-list '(1 2 3)) ; => (3 2 1)
(reverse-list '(a b c)) ; => (c b a)
