;; This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.
(defun sum-even (list)
   "This function takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list"
   (if (null list) ; if the list is empty
       0 ; return 0 since there are no even numbers to sum
       (if (evenp (car list)) ; if the first element in the list is even
          (+ (car list) (sum-even (cdr list))) ; add the first element to the sum and recursively call the function with the rest of the list
          (sum-even (cdr list))))) ; otherwise, recursively call the function with the rest of the list

;; Example usage:
(sum-even '(1 2 3 4 5)) ; returns 6, since 2 + 4 = 6.
