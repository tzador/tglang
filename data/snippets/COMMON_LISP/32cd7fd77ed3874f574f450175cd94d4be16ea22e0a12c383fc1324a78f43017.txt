;; Defining a function
(defun factorial (n) 
  "Return the factorial of n."
  (if (<= n 1) ; Check if n is less than or equal to 1
      1 ; If n is 1, return 1 as the factorial value
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; Else, multiply n and the factorial of n-1 to get the factorial value

;; Calling the function and printing the result
(print (factorial 5)) ; Should print the result as 120, which is the factorial of 5
