;; Annotation: This code snippet defines a function that recursively calculates the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n) ;; function definition with one parameter
  (if (<= n 1) ;; checks if the number is less than or equal to 1
    1 ;; returns 1 if the number is 1, base case of recursion
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ;; if number is not 1, multiplies current number with factorial of previous number
  )
