;; Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number

(defun factorial (n)
    "Computes the factorial of n"
    (if (zerop n)
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

;; The function takes in a parameter n and checks if it is equal to 0
;; If it is, the result is returned as 1
;; If it is not, then the recursive call is made by multiplying n with the factorial of n-1
;; This continues until n reaches 0 and the final result is returned.
