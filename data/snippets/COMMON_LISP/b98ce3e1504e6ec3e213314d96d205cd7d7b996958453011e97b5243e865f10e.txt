;; Define a function that checks if a number is divisible by 3 or 5
(defun divisible-by-3-or-5 (num)
  "Checks if a number is divisible by 3 or 5"
  (or (zerop (mod num 3)) ; check if number is divisible by 3
      (zerop (mod num 5)))) ;check if number is divisible by 5

;; Define a list of integers
(setq numbers-list '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))

;; Loop through the list and print "Divisible by 3 or 5" if the number is divisible by 3 or 5
(loop for num in numbers-list do

;; Output:

;; Divisible by 3 or 5
;; 4
;; Divisible by 3 or 5
