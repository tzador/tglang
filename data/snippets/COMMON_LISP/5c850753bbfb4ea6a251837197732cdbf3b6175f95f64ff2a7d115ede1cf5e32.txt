; This code defines a function that takes in a list of numbers and
; returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

(defun even-sum (numbers)                          ; Define a function named "even-sum" that takes in a parameter called "numbers"
  (let ((sum 0))                                   ; Use the let statement to create a variable "sum" and initialize it to 0
    (dolist (num numbers sum)                       ; Use the dolist loop to loop through each element in the "numbers" list
      (when (evenp num)                             ; Use the when statement to check if the current element is even
        (setf sum (+ sum num))))                    ; If it is even, add it to the current value of "sum" using the setf statement
    sum))                                           ; Return the final value of "sum" after looping through all elements

; Example usage:
(even-sum '(1 2 3 4 5 6))                          ; Call the even-sum function with a list of numbers as the argument 
; Output: 12                                        ; The sum of all even numbers in the list is 12
