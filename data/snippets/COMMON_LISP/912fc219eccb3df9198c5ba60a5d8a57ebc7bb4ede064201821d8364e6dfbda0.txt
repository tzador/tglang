;The code above uses a loop and multiple conditions
;to generate the classic FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to 100 in Common Lisp.
;The `multiple-of?` function checks if a number is a multiple of a given factor.
;The `collect` function gathers the outputs into a list.
;The `format` function outputs the result as a string.
;The `t` parameter in `format` indicates that the result should be printed to the standard output.
