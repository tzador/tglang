;; A function that checks if a given list of numbers
;; contains only even numbers and returns a boolean value

(defun all-even-p (numbers)
  "Checks if all the numbers in the list are even and returns a boolean value. Takes in a list of numbers as input."
  (if (equal nil numbers) ;; base case
      t
      (and (evenp (car numbers)) (all-even-p (cdr numbers))))) ;; recursive call

;; `all-even-p` takes in a list of numbers and checks if all the numbers are even.
;; It uses `equal` function to check if the list is empty, if it is, then it returns `t` which is the boolean value for true.
;; If the list is not empty, it uses `and` function to check if the first number in the list is even and recursively calls itself on the rest of the list.
;; If at any point, the first number is not even, it will return `nil` which is the boolean value for false, and the recursive call will stop.

;; Example:
(all-even-p '(2 4 6 8 10)) ;; returns true
(all-even-p '(1 2 3 4 5 6)) ;; returns false
