; This is a function that returns the sum of two numbers
(defun sum (a b)
    (+ a b))

; This is a function that returns the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n)
    (if (= n 1)
        1 ; base case
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; recursive case, calls factorial on n-1 and multiplies it with n

; This is a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number
(defun fibonacci (n)
    (if (< n 2)
        n ; first two numbers in Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1
        (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2))))) ; recursive case, calls fibonacci for n-2 and n-1 and adds them together

; Example usage:
(sum 5 7) ; => 12
(factorial 5) ; => 120
(fibonacci 8) ; => 21
