(defvar *example-list* '(1 2 3 4 5)) ; This creates a global variable named *example-list* with the list (1 2 3 4 5)

(defun reverse-list (lst) ; This creates a function named reverse-list that takes an argument lst
  "Reverses the order of a given list." ; This is a documentation string for the function
  (loop for elem in lst ; This begins a loop over each element in the list
    collect elem into reversed-list ; This adds each element to the new list, reversed-list
    finally (return reversed-list))) ; This ends the loop and returns the reversed list

(reverse-list *example-list*) ; This calls the reverse-list function on the *example-list* variable, returning the reversed list (5 4 3 2 1)
