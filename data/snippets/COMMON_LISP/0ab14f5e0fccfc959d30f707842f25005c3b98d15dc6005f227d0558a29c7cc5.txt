;; Define a function for calculating the factorial of a number

(defun factorial (n)
  "This function returns the factorial of a given number n"
  (if (equal n 0) ;; If n is 0, return 1
      1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ;; Otherwise, multiply n with the factorial of n-1 and return

;; Example usage:

(factorial 5) ;; This will return the factorial of 5, which is 120
