;;; Function for calculating the factorial of a number
;;; Takes in an integer n as input and returns the factorial of n as output

(defun factorial (n)
  (if (<= n 1) ; check if n is less than or equal to 1
      1 ; if yes, return 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; if not, multiply n with the factorial of (n-1) and repeat the process until n reaches 1

;;; Example input and output:

;;; Input: (factorial 5)
;;; Output: 120 ; factorial of 5 is 120

;;; Input: (factorial 0)
;;; Output: 1 ; factorial of 0 is 1
