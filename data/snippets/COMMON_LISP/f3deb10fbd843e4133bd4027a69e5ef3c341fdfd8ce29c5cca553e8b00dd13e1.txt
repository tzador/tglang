;; This code snippet uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number

(defun factorial (n) ; define a function called "factorial" that takes in parameter "n"
   (if (<= n 1) ; if n is less than or equal to 1
       1 ; then return 1
       (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; else return the product of n and the factorial of n-1

(print (factorial 5)) ; prints the factorial of 5 - 120
