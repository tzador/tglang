;; This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns their sum
(defun sum (number-list)
  (cond                                 ; Conditional statement
    ((null number-list) 0)              ; Base case: if list is empty, return 0
    (T (+ (car number-list) 
          (sum (cdr number-list))))))   ; Recursive call: add first element to sum of rest of list

(sum '(1 2 3 4 5))   ; Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)
