(defun factorial (n)
"Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number."
  (if (equal n 0) ; checks if n is equal to 0
      1 ; if n is equal to 0, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
      (* n (factorial (1- n))))) ; if n is not equal to 0, multiply n with the factorial of (n-1) and repeat the process until n is equal to 0
(factorial 5) ; function call to find the factorial of 5, which would return 120 as the output
