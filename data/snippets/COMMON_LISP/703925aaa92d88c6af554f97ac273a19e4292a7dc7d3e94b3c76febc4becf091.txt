;; This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

(defun sum-even-numbers (list)
    "Returns the sum of all the even numbers in the given list."
    (loop for num in list
        when (evenp num)
        sum num))
    ;; The 'loop' loop is used to iterate over each element in the list.
    ;; The 'for' loop specifies a variable 'num' to be used for each iteration.
    ;; The 'when' condition checks if the current element is even.
    ;; The 'sum' loop collects all the even numbers and adds them together.
    ;; The result is returned after the loop finishes.
