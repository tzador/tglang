(defun subseq-with-index (seq start end) ; define a function called subseq-with-index that takes in three parameters
  "Formats elements of a sequence with their indices." ; documentation string for the function
  (loop for i from start to end collect (list i (elt seq i)))) ; use a loop to collect elements from the start index to the end index, with the current index and element as items in a list

(subseq-with-index '(1 2 3 4 5) 2 4) ; execute the function with a sample sequence and indices, returns '((2 3) (3 4) (4 5)) which is a list of lists containing the indices and corresponding elements
