(defun factorial (n) ; Defining a function called 'factorial' that takes in one argument 'n'
  (if (equal n 0) ; If 'n' is equal to 0, return 1
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; Else, return 'n' multiplied by the result of the 'factorial' function called with 'n' minus 1 as the argument
  )

; This function calculates the factorial of a given number recursively. 
; For example, calling (factorial 4) would return the value 24.
