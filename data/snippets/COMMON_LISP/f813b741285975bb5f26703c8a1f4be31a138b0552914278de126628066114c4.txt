;; This code snippet creates a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns
;; the sum of all the elements in the list.
(defun sum-list (list) 
  "Returns the sum of all elements in list."
  (if (null list)
      0
      (+ (car list) (sum-list (cdr list)))))
  
;; Example usage of the function
(sum-list '(1 2 3 4 5)) ; Should output 15
(sum-list '()) ; Should output 0
(sum-list '(10 20 30)) ; Should output 60
