;;;; This is a Common Lisp program that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of the squares of those numbers.

;;;; Define the function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of the squares of those numbers.
(defun square-sum (lst)
  ;;;; Define the local variable for storing the total sum.
  (let ((total 0))
    ;;;; Iterate through the list of numbers using a loop.
    (loop for num in lst do
      ;;;; Calculate the square of the current number.
      (let ((square (* num num)))
        ;;;; Add the square to the total sum.
        (incf total square)))
    ;;;; Return the total sum.
    total))

;;;; Call the function with a sample list of numbers and print the output.
(format t "The sum of squares for the list ~a is ~a." '(1 2 3 4) (square-sum '(1 2 3 4)))

;;;; Output: "The sum of squares for the list (1 2 3 4) is 30."
