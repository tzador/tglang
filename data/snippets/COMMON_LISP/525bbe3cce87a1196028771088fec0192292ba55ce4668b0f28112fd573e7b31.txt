;; This is a code snippet in Common Lisp
;; It defines a function called 'find-prime-numbers' that takes in a list of numbers
;; and returns a list of all the prime numbers in the given list.

  "Checks if a number is prime or not"
  (cond ((<= num 1) nil)

        (t (loop for i from 3 to (sqrt num) by 2
                 never (zerop (mod num i))))))

(defun find-prime-numbers (lst)
  "Returns a list of prime numbers from a given list of numbers"
  (remove NIL (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (and (is-prime x) x)) lst)))
