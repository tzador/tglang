;; This code snippet shows how to use recursion to find the factorial of a number

(defun factorial (n)       ; define a function 'factorial' with parameter 'n'
  (if (= n 0)               ; check if n is equal to 0
      1                     ; if yes, return 1 as factorial of 0 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))  ; if no, multiply n with factorial of (n-1) and return the result

(factorial 5)              ; call the function with input 5, which should return 120 as 5! = 120
