;; Define a function that takes in a list and a number as parameters 
(defun count-numbers (list num)
;; Set a counter variable to keep track of the number of occurrences of the given number 
  (let ((counter 0))
;; Loop through the list and check each element if it is equal to the given number 
    (dolist (elem list)
;; If the element is equal to the given number, increment the counter 
      (when (= elem num)
        (incf counter)))
;; Return the final count 
    counter))

;; Example call: 
(count-numbers '(1 2 2 3 3 3 4 5) 3)
;; Output: 3
