;;; Defining a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

(defun factorial (n) ; Start a function definition named `factorial`, taking in one parameter `n`
  (if (<= n 1) ; If `n` is less than or equal to 1,
    1 ; return 1,
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; otherwise, recursively call `factorial` with the result of `n-1` and multiply it by `n`

(format t "Enter a number: ") ; Print a message asking for input
(setq input (read)) ; Read input from the user and set it to the variable `input`
(format t "Factorial of ~a is ~a~%" input (factorial input)) ; Print the factorial of the input using the `format` function and the `factorial` function we defined earlier
