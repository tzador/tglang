;;Defining a function that checks if a number is a prime number
(defun is-prime (num)
  (if (<= num 1) ; Checking if the number is less than or equal to 1
      nil ; If so, return false 
      (loop for i from 2 to (isqrt num) ; Iterating from 2 to the square root of the number
            always (not (zerop (mod num i)))))) ; Returning false if any number between 2 and the square root divides evenly
;;Example usage
(is-prime 17) ; Output: T (17 is a prime number)
(is-prime 30) ; Output: NIL (30 is not a prime number)
