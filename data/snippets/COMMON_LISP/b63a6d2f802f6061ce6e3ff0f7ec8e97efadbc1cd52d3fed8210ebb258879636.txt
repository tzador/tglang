;;; This is a complex code snippet that demonstrates the use of functions and control flow in COMMON_LISP. It takes in two lists of integers and returns a list of the maximum values from each list.

(defun max-values (list1 list2) ; Define a function with two parameters
  (let ((max-value1 (first list1)) ; Create a new variable to store the maximum value from list1
        (max-value2 (first list2))) ; Create a new variable to store the maximum value from list2
    (dolist (num list1) ; Iterate through each number in list1
      (if (> num max-value1) ; Check if the current number is greater than the current maximum value
          (setq max-value1 num))) ; Set the current number as the new maximum value if it is greater
    (dolist (num list2) ; Iterate through each number in list2
      (if (> num max-value2) ; Check if the current number is greater than the current maximum value
          (setq max-value2 num))) ; Set the current number as the new maximum value if it is greater
    (list max-value1 max-value2))) ; Return a list with the maximum values from list1 and list2
