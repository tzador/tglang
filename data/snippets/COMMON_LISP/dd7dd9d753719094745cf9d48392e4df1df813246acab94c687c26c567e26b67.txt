;; Function for calculating the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n) ; define function with parameter n (integer)
  (if (<= n 1) ; check if n is less than or equal to 1 (base case)
      1 ; return 1 (since factorial of 0 and 1 is 1)
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; recursively call factorial function with decremented n and multiply it with n
