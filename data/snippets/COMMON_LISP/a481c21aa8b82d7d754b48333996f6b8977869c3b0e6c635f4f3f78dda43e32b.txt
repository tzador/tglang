;;;; Calculate the factorial of a number

;;; Define a function that takes in a number and returns its factorial
(defun factorial (n)
  "Calculates the factorial of a number"
  ;; Check that the number is not negative 
  (if (<= n 0)
      (error "Input must be a positive integer")
    ;; If the number is 1, return 1 
    (if (= n 1)
        1
      ;; Otherwise, recursively call the function and multiply by n 
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))

;;; Test the function with various inputs 
(format t "Factorial of 1 is: ~d~%" (factorial 1))
(format t "Factorial of 5 is: ~d~%" (factorial 5))
(format t "Factorial of 10 is: ~d~%" (factorial 10))

;; Output:
;; Factorial of 1 is: 1
;; Factorial of 5 is: 120
;; Factorial of 10 is: 3628800
