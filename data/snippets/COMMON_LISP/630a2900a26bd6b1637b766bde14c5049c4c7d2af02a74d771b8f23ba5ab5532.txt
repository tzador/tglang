;;;; A simple program that creates a list of numbers and computes the sum of all even numbers in the list
;;;; Annotated code snippet

;;;; Defining a function to create a list of numbers
(defun create-list (n)
	"Creates a list of numbers from 1 to n"
	(loop for i from 1 to n collect i))

;;;; Defining a function to filter out even numbers from a list
(defun even-numbers (list)
	"Filters out even numbers from a list"
	(loop for num in list when (evenp num) collect num))

;;;; Defining a function to compute the sum of all numbers in a list
(defun sum (list)
	"Computes the sum of all numbers in a list"
	(reduce #'+ list))

;;;; Calling the functions to create a list and compute the sum of even numbers
(sum (even-numbers (create-list 10)))
