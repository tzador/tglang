;; Define a function that calculates the factorial of a number 
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (zerop n) ;; if number is 0 
      ;; return 1, since 0! = 1 
      1
      ;; otherwise, multiply n by the factorial of n-1 
      (* n (factorial (1- n)))))

;; Call the function with input of 5 
(factorial 5) ;; output: 120
