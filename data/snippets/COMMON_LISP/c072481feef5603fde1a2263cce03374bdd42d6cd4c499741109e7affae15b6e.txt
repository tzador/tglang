;;; Fibonacci function using dynamic programming and memoization
;;; Language: Common Lisp
;;; Input: n - the number in the Fibonacci sequence to be calculated
;;; Output: the value of the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence

;;;;;; This function uses memoization to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers
;;;;;; and reduce the number of recursive calls needed, improving the efficiency of the
;;;;;; function.

;;;;;; The variable fib-cache will store the already calculated Fibonacci numbers
;;;;;; in the form of a key-value pair, where the key is the n value and the value
;;;;;; is the corresponding Fibonacci number.

;;;;;; The function 'fib' takes in the input n and checks if the value is already
;;;;;; stored in the cache. If it is, the function simply returns the cached value.
;;;;;; Otherwise, it recursively calculates the Fibonacci number by calling itself
;;;;;; with the previous two numbers in the sequence (n-1 and n-2).

;;;;;; Once the Fibonacci number is calculated, it is stored in the cache for future
;;;;;; use and returned as the output.
