(defun factorial (n) ; defining a function named factorial that takes one parameter
  (if (<= n 1) ; if statement to check if n is less than or equal to 1
      1 ; if n is less than or equal to 1, return 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; otherwise, recursively call factorial for n-1 and multiply it with n
  )

(factorial 6) ; calling the factorial function with input 6
; expected output: 720 as 6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720
