(defun bubble-sort (lst) ; Defines a function named 'bubble-sort' that takes in one argument 'lst'
  (let ((n (length lst))) ; Assigns the length of the list to variable 'n'
    (loop for i from 0 to (- n 2) do ; Loops through the list from index 0 to n-2
      (loop for j from 0 to (- n i 2) do ; Loops through the list from index 0 to n-i-2
        (when (> (nth j lst) (nth (+ j 1) lst)) ; Checks if the current element is larger than the next element
          (rotatef (nth j lst) (nth (+ j 1) lst))))) ; If so, swap the two elements using 'rotatef' function
    lst)) ; Returns the sorted list after all elements have been checked and swapped
