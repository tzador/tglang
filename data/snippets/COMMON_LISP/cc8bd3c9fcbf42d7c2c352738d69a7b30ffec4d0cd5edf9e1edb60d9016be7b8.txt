(defun reverse-list (list)         ; defines a function called reverse-list that takes in a list as its parameter
  (if (null list)                  ; checks if the list is empty
      nil                          ; if true, returns nil (empty list)
      (append (reverse-list (cdr list))  ; appends the result of calling reverse-list on the rest of the list
              (list (car list)))))     ; with the first element of the list
                                     ; this effectively reverses the order of the elements in the list
