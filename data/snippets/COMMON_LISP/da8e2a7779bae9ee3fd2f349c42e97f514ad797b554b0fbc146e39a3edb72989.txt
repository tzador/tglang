;; Define a function named "myFunction" that takes in two parameters, "x" and "y"
(defun myFunction (x y)
  ;; Create a variable "z" and assign the value of "x" times "y" to it
  (let ((z (* x y)))
    ;; Create an if statement to check if "z" is equal to 10
    (if (= z 10)
      ;; If it is, print "z is equal to 10"
      (print "z is equal to 10")
      ;; If not, print "z is not equal to 10"
      (print "z is not equal to 10"))))
