;; This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

(defun sum-of-even (lst)  ;; define the function with the parameter `lst`
  (let ((sum 0))  ;; initialize the sum as 0
    (dolist (num lst)  ;; iterate through the list
      (when (evenp num)  ;; check if the number is even
        (setf sum (+ sum num))))  ;; add the number to the sum
    sum))  ;; return the sum as output

;; Example usage:
(sum-of-even '(1 2 3 4 5 6))  ;; outputs 12 (2 + 4 + 6 = 12)
