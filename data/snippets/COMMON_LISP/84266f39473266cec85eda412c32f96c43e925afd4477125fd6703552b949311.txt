(defun power (number n)
    "Recursive function to calculate the nth power of a number.
    Takes in two parameters: number (numeric) and n (non-negative integer)
    Returns the nth power of the given number."
    (if (= n 0) ; base case
        1 ; return 1 if power is 0
        (* number (power number (- n 1)))) ; recursively multiply number by itself n times
