`(defun factorial (n) ; Defines a function named "factorial" that takes in an argument "n"
	(if (<= n 1) ; If the value of n is less than or equal to 1
		1 ; Return the value 1
		(* n (factorial (- n 1)))) ; Otherwise, recursively call the factorial function with n-1 and multiply it with n
`

;Example function call:
(factorial 5) ; This will calculate the factorial of 5, which is 120
