;; Define a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum
(defun sum-list (lst) ;; defines a function named sum-list with parameter lst
  (let ((total 0)) ;; sets a local variable total to 0
    (dolist (num lst) ;; iterates through the list using dolist
      (incf total num)) ;; increments the total variable by the value of num
    (format t "Sum of the list is ~a" total))) ;; prints the sum of the list using format function
