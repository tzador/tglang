;;; This is a code snippet in Common Lisp for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
 
 ;; Function that takes in two numbers and returns their gcd using Euclid's algorithm
 
 (defun gcd (a b)
  "Calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm"
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (mod a b))))
 
 ;; Function to print the gcd of two numbers
 
 (defun print-gcd (a b)
  "Prints the greatest common divisor of two numbers"
  (print (format "The gcd of ~d and ~d is ~d" a b (gcd a b))))
 
 ;; Taking user input for the two numbers
 
 (setq num1 (read))
 (setq num2 (read))
 
 ;; Calling the print-gcd function with the two numbers
 
 (print-gcd num1 num2)
