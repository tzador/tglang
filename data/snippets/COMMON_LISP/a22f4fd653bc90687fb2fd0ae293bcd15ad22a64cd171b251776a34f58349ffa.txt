;;; A function to calculate the factorial of a number
; Takes in one parameter, n, and returns the factorial of n
(defun factorial (n)
  ; Set the result variable to 1
  (let ((result 1))
    ; Loop from n down to 1, multiplying result by each number
    (loop for i from n downto 1
    	; Multiply result by current number
    	do (setf result (* result i)))
    ; Return the final result
    result))
    
;;; Example usage
; Calculate the factorial of 5 and print the result
(format t "Factorial of 5: ~d~%" (factorial 5)) ; Output: Factorial of 5: 120
