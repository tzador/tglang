;; Define a function that checks if a number is even or odd
(defun check-even-odd (number) ;; function named check-even-odd with parameter 'number'
  (if (evenp number) ;; if condition to check if number is even
      (format t "~A is even." number) ;; if condition is true, print message with the number
      (format t "~A is odd." number))) ;; if condition is false, print message with the number

;; Call the function with a given number
(check-even-odd 10) ;; calling function with number 10 should return "10 is even."
(check-even-odd 5)  ;; calling function with number 5 should return "5 is odd."
