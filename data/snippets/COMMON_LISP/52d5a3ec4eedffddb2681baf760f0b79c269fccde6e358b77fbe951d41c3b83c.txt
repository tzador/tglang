;; A function to find the square root using Newton's method in Common Lisp
(defun sqrt (num)
  (let ((guess (/ num 2))) ;// start with an initial guess of half the number
    (loop 
      for i from 0 below 10 ;// repeat the process 10 times
      do
        (setf guess (/ (+ guess (/ num guess)) 2)) ;// update the guess using the Newton's method calculation
      ) 
    guess ;// return the final guess as the square root of the number
  )
)

;; Example output:
(sqrt 25)
