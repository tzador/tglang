;; This code snippet is a function that calculates the square root of a given number using Newton's method

;; Define a function 'square-root' with one parameter 'num'
(defun square-root (num)
  ;; Assign an initial guess for the square root (half of num)
  (let ((guess (/ num 2)))
    (loop
      ;; Calculate a better guess using Newton's method
      (let ((next-guess (/ (+ guess (/ num guess)) 2)))
        ;; Check if the difference between the current guess and the next guess is small enough
        (if (< (abs (- guess next-guess)) 0.001)
            ;; If it is, return the next guess as the square root
            (return-from square-root next-guess)
          ;; Otherwise, set the next guess as the current guess and repeat the loop
          (setf guess next-guess))))))
