;; Define a function named 'find-average' that takes in one argument, a list of numbers. 
;; The function should return the average of the numbers in the list.

(defun find-average (num-list) ; define function with parameter 'num-list'
  (let ((total 0) (count 0)) ; initialize variables for sum and count
    (dolist (num num-list) ; iterate through each number in the list
      (setf total (+ total num)) ; add current number to the total
      (incf count)) ; increment the count by 1
    (/ total count))) ; return the average by dividing the sum by the count

;; Example usage:
(find-average (list 1 2 3 4 5)) ; returns 3 as the average of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
