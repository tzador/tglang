h1. Welcome to My Blog!

p. This is a sample blog post written in Textile markup language. Here, we will explore the different features and syntax of Textile.

p. Textile is a lightweight markup language used for formatting and styling text content. It is easy to learn and use, making it a popular choice among bloggers and content creators.

h2. Text Formatting

p. Textile offers various text formatting options, such as *bold*, _italic_, and @code@. Additionally, it supports superscript^ and subscript~, as well as ~strikeout~ for text modification.

h2. Headings

p. Similar to HTML, Textile uses heading tags to structure the content. We can use the @h2@ tag for main headings and @h3@ for subheadings. It also supports up to six levels of heading tags.

h2. Lists

p. Textile provides both ordered and unordered list options. We can use @*@ for unordered lists and @#@ for ordered lists. Nested lists are also supported by adding additional asterisks or hashtags.

* Item 1
** Subitem 1
** Subitem 2
* Item 2

h2. Links

p. Creating links in Textile is simple and intuitive. We use double square brackets to enclose the link text and URL separated by a pipe |. For example, [link text|http://www.example.com].

h2. Images

p. Adding images to a blog post is just as easy with Textile. We use an exclamation mark followed by double square brackets to enclose the URL of the image. Additionally, we can add a title and caption to the image by separating them with a pipe | after the URL.

!http://www.example.com/image.jpg|title|caption!

h2. Tables

p. Tables can be created in Textile by using the pipe symbol | to separate columns and hyphens - to define column headers. We can also add alignment and formatting to the table for a more organized and visually appealing layout.

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |
| Row 1      | Row 1      |
| Row 2      | Row 2      |

h2. Code Blocks

p. For displaying code snippets, Textile allows us to use the @code@ tag, which will format the content as a code block and use syntax highlighting for different programming languages.

h2. Blockquotes

p. Lastly, Textile provides a @bq@ tag for creating blockquotes, perfect for quoting sources or adding emphasis to a specific text. We can also add attribution after the closing @bq@ tag for proper citation.
