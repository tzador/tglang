h1. Welcome to my TEXTILE code snippet!

p. This is a complex snippet of TEXTILE code that will hopefully demonstrate
some of the versatile features of this markup language. In the next few lines,
we will create a table with rows and columns, insert images, and use some
formatting options to make our snippet stand out.

|_. Programming Language |_. Release Date |_. Creator |
| Java | 1995 | James Gosling |
| Python | 1991 | Guido van Rossum |
| C++ | 1983 | Bjarne Stroustrup |
| Ruby | 1995 | Yukihiro Matsumoto |

p. Here we have a table with four columns and five rows, including the header row.
Each cell contains information about a specific programming language, such as its
release date and creator. Now let's add an image to our snippet.

!image.jpg!

p. This is a picture of a computer, representing the focus of our snippet on programming languages.
We can also use formatting options in TEXTILE, such as bold and italic text.

bq. This is a quote from computer scientist Alan Turing: "We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done."

p. Finally, let's add a list of programming languages using the LIST macro.

* Java
* Python
* C++
* Ruby

p. Thank you for checking out my TEXTILE code snippet! I hope you found it interesting and informative. Happy coding!
