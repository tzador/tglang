h2{color:red}. *TEXTILE Format*

TEXTILE allows you to customize text by adding formatting options like bold, italic, and underline. 

*This text will be bold.*
_This text will be italic._
+This text will be underlined.+ 

You can also use inline formatting in a sentence. Some common formatting options are:

- *bold*
- _italic_

h2{color:blue}. *TEXTILE Links*

You can add links to your TEXTILE documentation using the following format:

"Link text":https://www.linkaddress.com

"Google":https://www.google.com

This will create a clickable link to the Google homepage. 

h2{color:green}. *TEXTILE Lists*

** Item 2a
** Item 2b
