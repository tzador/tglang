h1. Introduction

p. This is a long and complex code snippet written in TEXTILE markup language. It is used for creating structured and formatted documents, similar to HTML. It is used mainly by developers and content creators for simple and efficient formatting.

h2. Code Snippet

bc. This is an example of a code snippet in TEXTILE markup:
%%%
def initialize(first_name, last_name)
  self.first_name = first_name
  self.last_name = last_name
end

h3. Explanation

This code snippet shows the use of the 'def' keyword to create a method called 'initialize' which takes in two parameters, 'first_name' and 'last_name'. Inside the method, the values of the parameters are set to instance variables using the 'self' keyword in combination with the equals sign '='. This is followed by the 'end' keyword to close the method definition.

Overall, this code snippet showcases the use of keywords, variables, and syntax in TEXTILE markup language. It is used to insert pre-formatted code blocks into a document, making it easier to read and understand for developers and content creators.
