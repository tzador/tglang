h1. Welcome to TEXTILE!

First, create a list of fruits in textile:

* Apples
* Oranges
* Bananas
* Grapes
* Pineapples

Now, let's make a table with the fruit names and their corresponding colors:

|_. Fruit Name |_. Color |
| Apples       | Red     |
| Oranges      | Orange  |
| Bananas      | Yellow  |
| Grapes       | Purple  |
| Pineapples   | Yellow  |

Next, let's add some formatting to the table by making the header cells bold and center aligned:

|_. *Fruit Name* |_. *Color* |
| Apples          | Red       |
| Oranges         | Orange    |
| Bananas         | Yellow    |
| Grapes          | Purple    |
| Pineapples      | Yellow    |

We can also add a link to a website for each fruit in the list:

* "Apples":https://www.apple.com/
* "Oranges":https://www.sunkist.com.au/
* "Bananas":https://www.dole.com/
* "Grapes":https://www.grapesfromcalifornia.com
* "Pineapples":https://www.delmonte.com/

Lastly, let's add some emphasis to certain words in the list:

**Apples**
*Oranges*
_Bananas_
_Grapes_
*Pineapples*
