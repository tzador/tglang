// The following code snippet creates a table using TEXTILE markup language

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation|
|Example Name |35 |Software Engineer|
|Second Example |27 |Graphic Designer|
|Third Example |40 |Data Analyst|

// This code snippet utilizes textile markup to generate a table with three columns: Name, Age, and Occupation. The first row contains the column headers, denoted by the "_. " prefix. Each subsequent row represents a different entry, with the corresponding information filled in. The "|" character separates the different columns in each row. This snippet also uses the "|" and "_" characters to create borders and headers for the table. Textile makes it easy to generate formatted tables without having to use complex HTML or CSS.
