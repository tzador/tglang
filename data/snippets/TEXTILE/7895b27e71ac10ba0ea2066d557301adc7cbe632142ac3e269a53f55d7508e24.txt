h1. Welcome to my Textile Blog!

p. Hello everyone! Today I want to introduce you to the awesomeness of *Textile*.

bq. First, let's talk about lists. With Textile, you can create ordered and unordered lists easily.
# This is an ordered list item.
# This is the second ordered list item.
* This is an unordered list item.
* This is the second unordered list item.

p. Next, let's move on to styling. With Textile, you can make text bold, italic, underlined, or even strike through.
*This text is bold.*
_This text is italic._
+This text is underlined.+
-This text is strike through.-

p. Images and links are also a breeze with Textile. Here's an example of an image and link to my favorite website:
!https://example.com/logo.png!
"Link to Example Website.":https://example.com/

p. Now, let's talk about tables. With Textile, you can create tables with ease, just like this:

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 |
| Another cell | Yet another cell |

p. And finally, let's not forget about blockquotes. You can use blockquotes to emphasize important information or to quote someone:
bq. "Textile is the best markup language ever created." - John Smith

p. That's all for today folks. I hope you enjoyed this little introduction to Textile. Happy coding!
