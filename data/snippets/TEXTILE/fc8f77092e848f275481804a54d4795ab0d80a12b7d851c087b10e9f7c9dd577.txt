h2(#intro). Introduction

This is a sample of a textile markup language code snippet. The "bq." at the beginning of the first line indicates a blockquote. The h4 tag following the "bq." specifies the heading level, followed by the content "Hello, World!" which will be displayed as a heading.

The next few lines demonstrate the use of unordered lists, with each item starting with an asterisk. The first two items have sublists following them, denoted by two asterisks. These sublists can have further sublists, indicated by three asterisks. This nesting can continue for as many levels as needed.

After the lists, we have a line of code enclosed within <code> tags. This will be displayed as a code block.

Finally, we have a heading tag using the "h2" tag, followed by the title "Introduction". This heading can be linked to using the anchor tag "(#intro)".

This is just a sample of the many features available in TEXTILE for creating richly formatted and annotated text.
