h1. Welcome to Textile!

This is a _dynamic and flexible_ markup language for creating beautifully-formatted text.

h2. Introduction

Textile offers a simple syntax for formatting text without using complex HTML tags. It supports basic formatting options like *bold*, /italic/, and -strikethrough-. Creating lists is also easy with the use of asterisks and numbers:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

h2. Images and Links

Adding images is as simple as using the `!` sign before the image URL:

!https://example.com/image.jpg!

Links can be added by enclosing the link text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses:

"My website":https://www.example.com

h2. Tables

Tables can be created by using pipes (`|`) to separate columns and hyphens (`-`) to denote column alignment:

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
| Row 1, Cell 1 | Row 1, Cell 2 | Row 1, Cell 3 |
| Row 2, Cell 1 | Row 2, Cell 2 | Row 2, Cell 3 |

h2. Code Blocks

To add code blocks, simply use the `bc. ` prefix before the code:

bc. print("Hello world!");

h2. Quotes

Quotes can be formatted using the `bq. ` prefix before the text:

bq. This is a quote from a famous person.

h2. Advanced Features

Textile also supports advanced features like footnotes, abbreviations, and block attributes. For a full list of these features, check out the Textile documentation.

h2. Conclusion

Textile is a powerful and versatile markup language that makes formatting text a breeze. Its easy syntax and support for advanced features make it a useful tool for any text-based project.
