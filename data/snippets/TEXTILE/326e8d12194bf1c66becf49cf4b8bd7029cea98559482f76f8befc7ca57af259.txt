p. *_This is a long and complex code snippet written in Textile markup language._*

bc. *This code generates a random password of specified length*
*It includes a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols*

p. *First, we need to define the length of the password*
*For this example, we will use a length of 12*

bc.. *Next, we need to define the characters to be used in the password*
*These will be stored in an array*

p. _All possible characters that can be used:_

bc. characters = ("a".."z").to_a + ("A".."Z").to_a + (0..9).to_a + ["!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")", "-", "_", "=", "+"]

p. *Now, we can generate the password by using a loop to randomly select characters from the array*

bc.. password = ""
12.times do
  password << characters[rand(characters.size)]
end

p. *Finally, we can print the password to the screen*
bc. puts "Your randomly generated password is: #{password}"
