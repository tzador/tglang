// Creating a table with multiple columns and rows in Textile

|_. Header 1 |_. Header 2 |_. Header 3 |
|*Cell 1*    |Cell 2      |{{red. Cell 3}} |

// The underscores and asterisks are used for formatting the table.
// The individual cells are separated by pipes (|), and the first row specifies the header cells.
// Double curly braces ({{ }}) are used for color formatting - here we have set Cell 3 to be red.
// The formatting codes can vary depending on the version of Textile being used.
