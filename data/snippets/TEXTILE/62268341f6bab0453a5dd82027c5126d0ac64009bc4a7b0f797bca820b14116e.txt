h1. Welcome to my textile code snippet!

p(this is a paragraph). Textile is a lightweight markup language used to format text in a simple and elegant way. You can use it to create headings, paragraphs, lists, and more.

h2(#lists). Lists

ul. Unordered List
* Item 1
* Item 2
** Nested Item 2a
** Nested Item 2b
* Item 3
* Item 4

ol. Ordered List
# Item 1
# Item 2
## Nested Item 2a
## Nested Item 2b
# Item 3
# Item 4

h2(#links). Links

p. You can easily create links using Textile. For example:
a(html:https://github.com "GitHub Homepage"). GitHub

h2(#images). Images

p. You can also insert images using the following syntax:
!https://i.imgur.com/DVfsy9p.jpg!

h2(#tables). Tables

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
| Row 1, cell 1 | Row 1, cell 2 | Row 1, cell 3 |
| Row 2, cell 1 | Row 2, cell 2 | Row 2, cell 3 |

|_. Centered Column |^_. Right-Aligned Column |_. Left-Aligned Column |
|<. Column 1 |>. Column 2 |<. Column 3 |

h2(#formatting). Text Formatting

p. You can use Textile to format text by adding symbols before and after the text. For example:
*Bold Text*
_Italic Text_
-Strikethrough Text-
+Underline Text+

h2(#code). Code

bc++(void). main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
}

pre(code). This is a preformatted text block.

h2(#references). References

p. You can use reference links to make your Textile code more organized and reusable. For example:
"Link to GitHub":https://github.com

h2(#linebreaks). Line Breaks

p. You can add line breaks by using the 'br.' tag.

p. This is the first line.
br.
p. This is the second line.

h2(#comments). Comments

]

h2(#escaping). Escaping

p. To escape symbols and special Textile characters, use an exclamation point (!). For example:
!Bold Text! will not be interpreted as bold text.

h2(#sections). Sections

p. Sections can be used to group your Textile code and add hierarchy. For example:
bq. This is a block quote section.

h2(#abbreviations). Abbreviations

p. If you have repetitive words or phrases, you can use abbreviations to save time. For example:
This is a long word (_lw_).

h2(#macros). Macros

My email address is @{email}(example@example.com).

h2(#footnotes). Footnotes

p. Textile also supports adding footnotes to your text. For example:
This is a sentence that requires a footnote^[This is the footnote text.].

h2(#ids). IDs

#(myid). This text can be referenced using the ID "myid".

h2(#markdown). Markdown Compatibility

p. Textile is compatible with Markdown syntax, so you can mix and match if needed.

h2(#codeblocks). Code Blocks

pre(code). This is a code block.
    int main() {
        cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    }

h2(#quotes). Quotes

bq. This is a block quote.
