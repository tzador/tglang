h1. Welcome to my Textile Blog!

h2. Introduction

This is a *blog* written in _Textile_ markup language, which makes it easier to create structured and styled content.

p. Textile is similar to _Markdown_ but has some unique features that make it stand out. For example, it has a built-in shorthand for creating tables, such as:

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation |
| John | 32 | Programmer |
| Jane | 28 | Designer |
| Mark | 43 | Manager |
