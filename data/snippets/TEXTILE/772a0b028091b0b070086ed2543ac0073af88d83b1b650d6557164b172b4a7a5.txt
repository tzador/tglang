h1. Welcome to my TEXTILE code snippet!

This is my first code snippet using TEXTILE. It is a long and complex one, so let's break it down step by step.

>>>h2. Formatting

With TEXTILE, we can easily format our text by adding symbols before and after the text we want to change. For example, *this* text will be bold, _this_ text will be italicized, and -this- text will be strikethrough. Additionally, we can add a header by using the "h2." tag before the text.

>>>h2. Lists

Lists are also easy to create in TEXTILE. We can use the "*" symbol before each item to create an unordered list, and the "#" symbol to create an ordered list. We can also create nested lists by indenting the items with a tab.

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

# Item 1
# Item 2
# Item 3

# Nested List
	* Subitem 1
	* Subitem 2
	* Subitem 3

>>>h2. Tables

TABLES are another useful feature in TEXTILE. To create a table, we use the "|" symbol to separate columns and "-" symbols to create rows.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Data 4   | Data 5   | Data 6   |
| Data 7   | Data 8   | Data 9   |

>>>h2. Links

We can also add links in TEXTILE using the "link:text" syntax. For example, [Google](https://www.google.com/) will create a link to Google's website.

>>>h2. Images

Images can also be easily inserted using the "image:someimage.jpg" syntax.

!https://www.example.com/image.jpg!

>>>h2. Escaping Characters

If we need to use symbols that are reserved in TEXTILE, we can escape them by using a backslash before the symbol.

>>>h2. Conclusion

That concludes our overview of TEXTILE and its various features. It is a powerful markup language that can be used for formatting text, creating lists and tables, adding links and images, and more. It may seem complex at first, but with practice, you'll become a master at using TEXTILE in no time!
