h1(#header)[Textile Code Snippet]

This is a long and complex code snippet written in the programming language Textile.

I want to generate a table using textile formatting, with the following columns:

| Name | Age | Gender | Occupation |

The table should have 3 rows, with data for 3 different people.

| Jack | 24 | Male | Programmer |
| Emily | 32 | Female | Doctor |
| Tom | 45 | Male | Engineer |

To add some formatting to the table, I will wrap it in a div and add a class of 'table'.

div(table).

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Gender |_. Occupation |
| Jack | 24 | Male | Programmer |
| Emily | 32 | Female | Doctor |
| Tom | 45 | Male | Engineer |

To add some styling to the header, I will use the h1 tag.

To add a list, I will use the 'ul' and 'li' tags. I will also add some formatting to the list with a class of 'list'.

div(list).

*[Name] Jack
*[Age] 24
*[Gender] Male
*[Occupation] Programmer

*[Name] Emily
*[Age] 32
*[Gender] Female
*[Occupation] Doctor

*[Name] Tom
*[Age] 45
*[Gender] Male
*[Occupation] Engineer

To add a link, I will use the 'a' tag and specify the url and link text.

a(https://www.example.com)[Link to Example Website]

I can also add formatting to the link by adding a class.

a(https://www.example.com)(class="link")[Link to Example Website]
