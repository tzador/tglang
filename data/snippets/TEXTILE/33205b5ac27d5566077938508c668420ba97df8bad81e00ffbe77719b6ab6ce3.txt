# Title: Introduction to Textile Markup

Textile is a lightweight markup language that is used to format text in a simple and consistent way. It is often used in content management systems and blogs.

## Section 1: Basic Syntax

To create headings in Textile, use the number sign (#). The number of number signs corresponds to the level of the heading. 

### Level 3 Heading

p. Paragraphs can be created by simply typing the text. A line break can be achieved by ending the line with two or more spaces.

b. To make text bold, use asterisks around the word or phrase. For example, *bold* will appear as bold.

i. To make text italicized, use underscores around the word or phrase. For example, _italic_ will appear as italicized.

h2. Lists

- To create a bulleted list, use dashes (-) or asterisks (*) at the beginning of each line.
- To create a numbered list, use numbers followed by a period (1.) at the beginning of each line.

# Tables

Textile allows you to create tables by using pipes (|) to separate columns and hyphens (-) to create the table header. 

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data 1   | Data 2   |
| Row 2    | Data 3   | Data 4   |
| Row 3    | Data 5   | Data 6   |

bq. Blockquotes are created by beginning the line with a greater than sign (>).

h3. Links

Links can be created using angle brackets (<>) around the URL. For example, <http://www.example.com> will appear as a clickable link.

h4. Images

Images can be added using exclamation marks (!) followed by parentheses containing the URL of the image. For example, !(<http://www.example.com/image.jpg>) will display the image.

## Conclusion

Textile offers a simple and consistent way to format text, making it a popular markup language for content creation. With its easy-to-use syntax and support for common formatting elements, it is a great choice for creating clean and organized content.
