h1. Welcome to my TEXTILE code snippet!

This is an example of complex formatting using the TEXTILE syntax.

bq. This is a block quote using the textile syntax. It can be used for longer quotes and can be used within other elements.

h2. Header 2

p. This is a paragraph that contains *bold*, _italic_, and +underlined+ text. It also has a ~strikethrough~ and a _^super^script_ and a _~sub~script_.

p. Here is a *bulleted list*:
* First item
* Second item
* Third item

p. And here is a #numbered list#:
# First item
# Second item
# Third item

table(table table-striped).
|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
| Value 1 | Value 2 | Value 3 |
| Value 4 | Value 5 | Value 6 |

q. This is a quote with attribution:
bq. "Code is poetry - Myself"

p. Here is a "link to Google":https://www.google.com using TEXTILE syntax.

p. This is a @[code snippet] that can be used to showcase your TEXTILE code.

{color:blue} This text is in blue.{color}

h3. Header 3

p. Text can also have "hyperlinks":https://www.example.com and ^footnotes^[1] using the TEXTILE syntax.

p. h@. This is a hidden comment using the syntax.
h@.

p. Here is a *preformatted block*:

bc. public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}

p. And here is a *note* using the TEXTILE syntax:
fn(n). This is a footnote. 

p(note). This is a note that can be used for further explanations.

h4. Header 4

p. Here is an image using the TEXTILE syntax:
!https://example.com/image.jpg!

p. This is a *block of code* using the TEXTILE syntax:
bc. def function(param1, param2):
    if param1 == param2:
        print("They are equal.")
    else:
        print("They are not equal.")

Thank you for checking out my TEXTILE code snippet! Feel free to play around and test out different formatting options. Happy coding!
