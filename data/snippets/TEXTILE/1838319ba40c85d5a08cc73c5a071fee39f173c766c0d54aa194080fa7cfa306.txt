h1. Introduction


p. Bienvenue to my TEXTILE program! This code snippet will demonstrate the use of various textile formatting options. Let's dive in!

h2. Text formatting


p. *Bold* text can be achieved by using an asterisk before and after the desired text. For _italic_ text, simply use an underscore instead. To make text appear as a heading, use the "h2." tag followed by a space and the desired heading text.


h2. Lists


p. Unordered lists can be created by using a "-" before each list item. For ordered lists, use a number followed by a "." for each item. Nested lists can be achieved by using additional "-" or numbers with corresponding indentation.


h2. Links and Images


p. To create a link, use square brackets around the link text followed by a colon and the link URL inside parentheses. For images, use an exclamation mark before the square brackets and include the image URL inside parentheses.


h2. Tables


p. Tables can be created by using pipes "|" to separate columns and hyphens "-" to create a header row. To align text in a column, add a colon ":" before or after the text.


h2. Code snippets


p. Code snippets can be formatted by adding backticks "`" before and after the code. To specify the programming language, use a colon followed by the language name after the first set of backticks.


h2. Blockquotes


p. To create a blockquote, use a ">" before the desired text. Nested blockquotes can be created by adding additional ">". To cite the source of the quote, use two spaces after the blockquote and add the citation.


h2. Comments


p. Comments can be added by using "//" before the desired comment text. Comments are not visible in the final output. They can be used to add notes or explanations for the code.


h2. Conclusion


p. That concludes our demonstration of textile formatting. Thanks for reading!
