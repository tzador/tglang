h1. Welcome to the Textile Programming Language!

p. First, let's define a variable and assign a value to it
->name = "John"

p. Next, we can use a conditional statement to check the value of the variable
->if name == "John"
  ->h2. Hello John!
->else
  ->h2. Hello Stranger!

p. We can also use loops to iterate through a list of values
->numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
->for number in numbers
  ->p. The current number is "#{number}"

p. Lastly, we can use functions to perform specific tasks
->def add(a, b)
  ->return a + b
->end

p. Let's use our function to add two numbers
->num1 = 3
->num2 = 5
->p. The sum of #{num1} and #{num2} is "#{add(num1, num2)}".

p. Voila! You have successfully used Textile to perform basic programming tasks.
