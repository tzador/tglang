h1. Introduction

Welcome to the *TEXTILE* programming language! This language is designed for creating rich and structured documents. Here is a simple and complex code snippet to give you an idea of what TEXTILE is capable of.

h2. Lists

Here's an unordered list:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

Here's an ordered list:

# Number 1
# Number 2
# Number 3

h2. Headings

TEXTILE allows for multiple levels of headings:

h3. Heading level 3

h4. Heading level 4

h5. Heading level 5

h6. Heading level 6

h2. Formatting

TEXTILE allows for various formatting options, such as *bold*, _italic_, +underline+, -strikethrough-, and ^superscript^. You can also combine multiple formatting options together, such as *+bold and underlined+* or _^italic and superscript^_.

h2. Links and Images

Creating links and images is made easy with TEXTILE. Check out this link: "https://www.example.com":http://example.com. And here is an image:

h2. Tables

Tables are a great way to organize data in TEXTILE. Here's an example of a table:

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation |
| John | 28 | Programmer |
| Sarah | 32 | Designer |
| Tom | 24 | Writer |
 
h2. Code Blocks

TEXTILE also supports displaying code snippets in a formatted code block. Here's an example:

bc.. This is a block of code in TEXTILE:

p. h1. Hello, world!
p. Let's say hello to the world in TEXTILE!

h2. Quotes

Quotes can be displayed in TEXTILE using the bq. tag. Here's an example:

bq. "Life is about making an impact, not making an income."
- Kevin Kruse

h2. Escaping

In case you want to include characters that have special meaning in TEXTILE, you can use the escape character '\' before the character. For example, to display a literal asterisk (\*) you would write \\\ as the code.

h2. Conclusion

That's just a small glimpse into the capabilities of TEXTILE. With more practice, you'll be able to create beautifully formatted documents in no time!
