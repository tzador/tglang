h2. My Complex Textile Code Snippet

p. This is a sample paragraph in Textile, where we can use various text formatting options such as *bold*, _italic_, +underlined+, and ^superscripted^. We can also create links like "Google":http://www.google.com and lists such as "*" Unordered List and "#" Ordered List. Additionally, we can insert images using !image.jpg! and create tables as follows:

|_. Column 1|_. Column 2|_. Column 3|
|Row 1, Column 1|Row 1, Column 2|Row 1, Column 3|
|Row 2, Column 1|Row 2, Column 2|Row 2, Column 3|

bc. This is a code block in Textile. We can use different syntax highlighting options here, such as 'java', 'python', 'html', etc.

bq. This is a blockquote in Textile, used for highlighting important text or adding quotes from other sources.

fn1. This is a footnote in Textile, used for providing additional information or references.

h3. Nested elements

p. Textile allows nesting of elements, like having a _nested _{color:blue}italic and blue{color} text_ inside a *bold and +underlined+ text.* We can also combine multiple formatting options, such as {color:red}^bold, red, and superscripted^{color}.

pre. Textile also has a preformatted text option, used for displaying code or preserving whitespace formatting. <p>Hello, this is a <b>preformatted</b> text.</p>

h4. Textile Macros

p. We can define and use macros in Textile as follows:

bc. #define macro
@html@
<p>This is a macro that outputs HTML code.</p>
@end

p. We can then use the macro with @macro@ in our Textile text, which will output: 

macro.

!{color:blue}^THE END^{color}!
