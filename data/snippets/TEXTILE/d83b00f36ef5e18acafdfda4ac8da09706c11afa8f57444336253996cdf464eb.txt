h1. Welcome to my textile code snippet!

p. This is a long and complex snippet that showcases the power of TEXTILE markup language. First, let's start with some basic text formatting:

bq. This text will be displayed as a block quote. You can also use *bold*, _italic_, and +underlined+ formatting.

p. Next, we can add links to external websites or even anchor links within the document:

"This is a link to Google":http://www.google.com
"This is an anchor link to a section below":#section1

p. Tables are also easy to create in TEXTILE:

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation |
| John | 35 | Developer |
| Sarah | 28 | Designer |
| Alex | 40 | Manager |

p. Now let's add some more complex features, such as images, code blocks, and lists:

!http://example.com/image.jpg!

bc. This is a code block in TEXTILE. You can specify the language by adding `bc{code language}` after the backticks.

# This is a numbered list:
# First item
# Second item
# Third item

* This is a bullet list:
* First item
* Second item
* Third item

p. Lastly, we can also add footnotes and definitions:

fn1. This is a footnote.

bc!. Here is a definition for the TEXTILE markup language: 
TEXTILE is a lightweight and easy-to-use markup language for formatting text and adding basic media elements. It is commonly used for creating documentation, blog posts, and other online content.

p. That concludes our TEXTILE code snippet. Hopefully, this gives you a glimpse into the versatility and ease of use of this markup language. Happy coding!
