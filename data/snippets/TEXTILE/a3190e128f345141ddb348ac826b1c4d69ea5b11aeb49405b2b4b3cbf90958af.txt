|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
| #. Item 1 | h1. Heading 1 | bq. Blockquote 1 |
| #. Item 2 | h2. Heading 2 | bq. Blockquote 2 |
| #. Item 3 | h3. Heading 3 | bq. Blockquote 3 |

In textile, you can use "|" to create table cells and "_" to indicate a table header. The "#." syntax is used to denote ordered list items. "h1." is used to create a level 1 heading, while "bq." is used to create blockquotes. 

In this code snippet, we are creating a table with three columns and populating it with some data. We also use ordered list items to number the rows and add headings and blockquotes to each column. This demonstrates the versatility of textile in being able to format and organize information in a structured manner.
