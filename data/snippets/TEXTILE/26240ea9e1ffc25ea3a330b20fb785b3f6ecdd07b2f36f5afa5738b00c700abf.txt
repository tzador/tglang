h1. Textile Code Snippet

Let's create a complex formatted Textile code snippet!

*Use asterisks for bold text*
_Or underscores for italicized text_
"Quotation marks for block quote text":http://someurl.com

We can also add links using the link text and URL separated by a |
"Hyperlink":http://someurl.com|Target="_blank"|Title="Visit this website!"

h2. Text formatting

In addition to the basic formatting options above, Textile also offers some extra features:

- Numbered lists are created using a # before each list item
- Bulleted lists can be made by starting a line with a * or -
- We can also use the -# to create multiple levels of indentation in a list
- Images can be inserted using an exclamation point followed by the image URL and optional sizing

h3. Tables

Tables can be created using | symbols for column separators and hyphens for the table headers.

|_. Name |_. Age |
| John | 22 |
| Sarah | 28 |
| Tom | 33 |

h4. Code snippets

For displaying code snippets, we can use the % symbol before and after the code:

%div
  %h1 Hello, world!
  %p This is a Textile code snippet.

We can also add syntax highlighting by specifying the language after the first % symbol:

%div.lang-ruby
  %h1 Hello, world!
  %p This is a Ruby code snippet.

h5. Special characters

Textile has some escape characters for special characters, such as ampersands and greater than/less than signs.

To display an ampersand, use "&amp;"
To display a greater than sign, use "&gt;"
To display a less than sign, use "&lt;"

h6. Notes

To add notes or comments in the code, use the double backslash ("\") before the note.

This is a regular line of text.
\\This is a note that will not be displayed in the final output.

bq. This is a block quote.

Output:
