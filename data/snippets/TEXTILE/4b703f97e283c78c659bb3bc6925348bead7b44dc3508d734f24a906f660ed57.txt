#TEXTILE CODE SNIPPET FOR A BLOG POST

h1. "Welcome to My Blog"

p. Hello and welcome to my blog! In this blog post, we will be discussing the basics of coding in the Textile markup language and how it can be used to format your blog posts.

h2. "Getting Started"

In order to start writing in Textile, you will need to add "@"/parts/textile-js.js":http://textile-js.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/textile.js to your website's code or download and install the Textile plugin for your preferred blogging platform.

h2. "Basic Formatting"

h3. "Paragraphs"

In Textile, paragraphs are created simply by adding a blank line between chunks of text. 

p. This is an example of a paragraph in Textile. It consists of multiple sentences and is separated from the following paragraph by a blank line.

h3. "Lists"

Ordered and unordered lists are created by using "*" or "#" respectively, followed by a space and the list item. Indentation can be used for nested lists.

# This is an ordered list item.
# This is another ordered list item.
# This is a nested list item.
## This is a sub-list item.
# This is the final ordered list item.

h3. "Links"

Links can be created by placing the link text in quotes, followed by a colon and the URL.

"Github":http://www.github.com

h3. "Images"

Images can be inserted by using exclamation marks, followed by the image's URL in parentheses and an optional title in quotes.

!https://www.example.com/image.jpg(My Image Title)!

h2. "Advanced Formatting"

h3. "Tables"

Tables can be created using "|" to separate columns and "--" for horizontal lines. Column headers can be created by using "=" at the beginning of the first row.

|= Column 1 |= Column 2 |
|--|--|
| Data 1 | Data 2 |
| Data 3 | Data 4 |

h3. "Code Block"

Code blocks can be created by adding "%" at the beginning and end of the code snippet.

%{
  var num1 = 2;
  var num2 = 3;
  var sum = num1 + num2;
  console.log("The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + sum + ".");
}%

h3. "Quotes"

Quotes can be inserted by using ">" at the beginning of the quoted text.

> "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken." - Oscar Wilde

h3. "Footnotes"

Footnotes can be created by adding a "^" followed by the footnote content and a "[number]" at the end of the sentence that requires the footnote. The footnote content can be placed at the bottom of the page.

This is a sentence that requires a footnote.^Footnote content [1]

p. [1] This is the footnote content. 

h2. "Conclusion"

Thank you for reading this blog post on the basics of coding in Textile. We hope you found it helpful in formatting your own blog posts. Happy blogging!
