h1. **Welcome to Textile Programming!**

p. In this program, we will be learning the basics of the Textile programming language. Textile is a markup language used to format text into structured documents. It is primarily used for creating web content and is similar to other markup languages such as HTML and Markdown.

h2. **Text Formatting**

p. Textile offers various formatting options to style text. For example, to make a word bold, you can use double asterisks: **bold**. Similarly, to make a word italicized, you can use single underscores: _italic_. Other formatting options include headings, lists, links, and images.

h3. **Headings**

p. Headings are created by adding a number of equal signs before and after the text. For example, h1. will create a top-level heading, h2. will create a subheading, and so on. These tags must be placed on separate lines.

h3. **Lists**

p. Textile supports both ordered and unordered lists. Ordered lists are created by using numbers, while unordered lists are created using bullets (*, +, or -). Lists can also be nested within each other for better organization.

h3. **Links**

p. Creating links in Textile is easy. To create a link, use the syntax link:URL["link text"]. For example, link:https://www.example.com["Example Website"] will create a link to the Example Website.

h3. **Images**

p. Similar to links, Textile also allows you to insert images into your document. To add an image, use the syntax image:URL["alt text"]. This will insert the image at the specified URL with the specified alternative text.

h2. **Example Code**

p. Now, let's try creating a simple webpage using Textile:

----
h1. **My Website**

p. This is a paragraph of text.

h2. **List of Things**

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
  + Item 3a
  + Item 3b

p. For more information, visit link:https://www.example.com["My Website"].

p. That's it! Save this file as index.textile and open it in your browser to see the results.
