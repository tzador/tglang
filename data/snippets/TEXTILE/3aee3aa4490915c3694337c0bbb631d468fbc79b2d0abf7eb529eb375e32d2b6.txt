// Complex code snippet in TEXTILE language

Wow, look at this complex TEXTILE code snippet:

# First Textile Heading

* This is a list item
* This is another list item
* This list contains a sublist:
** Sublist item 1
** Sublist item 2

Paragraph with *emphasis* and _strong_

Here is some code:

    h2. Another Textile Heading

    p. This is a paragraph

    # Some code
    h4. A heading in the code block

    _Sub-heading in the code_
    p. Here is some more code

Table with a heading and three columns:
