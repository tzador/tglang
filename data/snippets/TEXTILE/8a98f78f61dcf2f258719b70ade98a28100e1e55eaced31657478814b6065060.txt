h1. Welcome to my Textile document!

p. This is my first Textile document, created using a code snippet in programming language 'TEXTILE'. It's a great way to generate well-formatted and complex code snippets for documentation or other purposes.

h2. A beginner's guide to Textile

p. Textile is a simple markup language used for formatting plain text documents. It's similar to other markup languages like Markdown and HTML, but offers more advanced formatting options and features.

* Lists: Textile supports both numbered and bulleted lists, which can be easily created using the asterisk (*) and pound (#) symbols respectively.

* Links: Links can be added using the square bracket notation, for example [Google](https://www.google.com).

* Images: Textile allows for the inclusion of images in documents, using the exclamation point (!) and the square bracket notation. For example, !https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Hello_world_c.svg/1200px-Hello_world_c.svg.png!

* Tables: Tables can be created using the pipe (|) symbol and hyphens (-) for headers. See below for an example:

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation |
| John Doe | 30 | Software Developer |
| Jane Smith | 25 | Graphic Designer |
| Mark Johnson | 40 | Accountant |

h3. Advanced Formatting

p. Textile also supports more advanced formatting options, such as:

* Headings: The "h1." syntax can be used for top-level headings, while "h2." and "h3." can be used for secondary and tertiary headings respectively.

* Bold and Italics: Text can be formatted in bold using asterisks (*) or underscores (_) and in italics using single asterisks or underscores.

* Alignment: Text can be aligned using colons (:) at the beginning and/or end of a line. For example, :centered text: or :right aligned:.

h4. Conclusion
