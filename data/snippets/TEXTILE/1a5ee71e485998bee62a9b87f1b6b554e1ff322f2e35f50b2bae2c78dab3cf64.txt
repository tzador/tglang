h1. This is a heading

This is a paragraph of text formatted in Textile.

Here is a list of items:
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

An image can also be embedded in Textile using an exclamation mark, followed by the image URL and optional title:
!https://example.com/image.jpg(My Image)

Text can be styled with various formatting options, such as bold, italics, and underlining:
This is *bold* text, _italic_ text, and -underlined- text.

Tables can be created by using a combination of pipes and dashes to separate columns and rows, with the first row typically used for headers:
|_. Item |_. Quantity |_. Price |
| Item 1 | 5 | $10 |
| Item 2 | 3 | $8 |
| Item 3 | 2 | $5 |

Links can be inserted with square brackets for the text and parenthesis for the URL:
"Example link":https://example.com

Code blocks can be created by wrapping the code in double curly braces:
{{code block}}

And finally, there are also options for creating footnotes and citations using caret symbols:
