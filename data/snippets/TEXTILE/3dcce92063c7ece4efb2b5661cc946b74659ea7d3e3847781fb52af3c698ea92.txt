The creation of an unordered list in TEXTILE

* Item 1
* Item 2
    # Subitem 2.1
    # Subitem 2.2
* Item 3
**. Subitem 3.1
**. Subitem 3.2

Explanation:
The asterisk symbol "*" denotes the start of an item in a list.
Subitems are denoted by using the hash symbol "#" before the asterisk symbol.
Double asterisks "**" can be used to create a nested list or a level deeper in the hierarchy.
The period symbol "." followed by the asterisk symbol denotes a sublist within that particular item.
Each item and subitem are separated by a new line.
