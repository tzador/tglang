h1. Welcome to my textile code snippet!

p. This code snippet showcases the different text formatting features available in textile.
bq. We will start with a blockquote, which is created using the "bq." tag.

h2. Text Formatting
p. Textile allows for various styles of text formatting such as bold, italics, and underlined.
*bold text* is created using "*" at the beginning and end of the text.
_italicized text_ is created using "_" at the beginning and end of the text.
+underlined text+ is created using "+" at the beginning and end of the text.
h2. Lists
p. Textile also supports different types of lists.
* Bulleted lists are created using an asterisk (*) at the beginning of each item.
+ Numbered lists are created using a plus (+) at the beginning of each item.
- Definition lists are created using a hyphen (-) at the beginning of each definition.
p. Nested lists are also supported and are created by adding an extra asterisk/star (+) at the beginning of each nested item.

h2. Links
p. Links in Textile are created using the "link: URL" syntax. For example, "link: https://www.example.com".

h2. Images
p. Images can be embedded in textile by using the "image: URL" syntax. For example, "image: https://www.example.com/image.jpg".

h2. Tables
p. Tables can be created using the "table." tag, followed by the table contents enclosed in a pipe (|) symbol. The first row is considered the table header and the second row is used to define the alignment of the columns.
|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |
| Row 1 | Row 1 |
| Row 2 | Row 2 |
| Row 3 | Row 3 |

h2. Code Snippets
p. Textile also allows for the insertion of code snippets using the "code." tag. This snippet will be formatted in a monospace font.

code. <h1>Hello World!</h1>

h2. Block Elements
p. Block elements can be created using the "article." tag and can include any type of formatting or content within it.

article.
* This is a block element
* It can contain any type of content, including other formatting and media.

h2. Footnotes
p. Footnotes can be added using the "fn" tag and will appear at the bottom of the page. The footnote number is automatically generated and can be linked back to the reference in the text.
fn1. This is a footnote.

h2. Escape Characters
p. To use special characters in textile, they must be escaped using "\". For example, "\*" will be displayed as an asterisk instead of creating bold text.

h2. Conclusion
