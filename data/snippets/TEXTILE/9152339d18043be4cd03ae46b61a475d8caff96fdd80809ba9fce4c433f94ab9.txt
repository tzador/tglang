h1. Welcome to my textile code snippet!

**This is a bold line of text.**
_This is an italic line of text._
*p{text-align:center}* This is a paragraph centered using the `text-align` attribute.

h2. A list of items:
# Item 1
# Item 2
# Item 3
# Item 4

{color:blue}This text is blue.{color}
{color:red}This text is red.{color}
{color:green}This text is green.{color}

bq. This is a block quote.

h3. A nested list:
# Sub-item 1
## Sub-sub-item 1.1
## Sub-sub-item 1.2
# Sub-item 2
## Sub-sub-item 2.1
## Sub-sub-item 2.2

h4. An ordered list with a link:
# Item 1
# Item 2
# Item 3 "https://www.example.com"

h5. A table with three columns and three rows:
|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
|Row 1, Cell 1|Row 1, Cell 2|Row 1, Cell 3|
|Row 2, Cell 1|Row 2, Cell 2|Row 2, Cell 3|
|Row 3, Cell 1|Row 3, Cell 2|Row 3, Cell 3|

h6. A code block:
bc.. [h4. A code block:]
## Begin source code
This is where the code would go.
## End source code


The color of the text can be changed by using the `color` attribute and specifying a color. The text can also be styled using markdown syntax such as bold `**` and italic `_`.

A nested list can be created by using two `#` symbols for each level. An ordered list can include a link by placing the link in quotation marks after the item number.

To create a table, use `|_.` for the table header and `|` for each cell in a row.

To create a code block, use `bc..` before starting the code and `##` to indicate the beginning and end of the code.
