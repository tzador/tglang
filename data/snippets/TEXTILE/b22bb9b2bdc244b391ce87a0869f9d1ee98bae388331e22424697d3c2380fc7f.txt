h1. Welcome to my Textile Blog

p. This blog is dedicated to all things Textile. 

h2. The Origins of Textile

p. Textile was created in 2002 by Dean Allen as a simple way to format text for blogs and websites. 

bq. "The best way to learn Textile is just to dive in and start using it!" - Dean Allen 

h2. Basic Text Formatting

p. Textile uses simple symbols to format text. For example, an asterisk (*) before and after a word or phrase will make it bold. Similarly, wrapping text in underscores (_) will italicize it. 

p. H1 headers can be achieved by starting a line with a pound sign (#) followed by a space, while H2 headers are created with two pound signs (##). 

h2. Lists and Links

p. Creating a list in Textile is easy. Simply start a line with an asterisk (*) followed by a space and then type out the list item. For numbered lists, use a pound sign (#) instead. 

p. Adding links in Textile is also straightforward. Surround the link text with quotation marks and follow it with a colon. Then, put the URL in parentheses. For example: "My Website":(https://www.example.com) 

h2. Images

p. Images can be added to your blog post using the exclamation point (!) followed by the image URL in square brackets, followed by the image title in quotes, and then optionally a width in parentheses. For example: ![(https://www.example.com/image.jpg) "My Image"](200) 

h2. Conclusion

p. That's just a small taste of what Textile can do. Start using it in your own blogs and websites to make formatting text a breeze!
