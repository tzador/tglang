This is an example article written in TEXTILE, a markup language used for formatting text in a simple and readable way. In this article, we will cover the basic syntax and functionality of TEXTILE to help you get started.

h3. Formatting Text
TEXTILE allows you to easily format text by adding simple symbols or characters. For example, surrounding a word or phrase with asterisks (*) will make it bold, while surrounding it with underscores (_) will make it italicized. You can also use double asterisks (**) for strong text and double underscores (__) for emphasized text.

TEXTILE also allows you to create ordered and unordered lists by using symbols or numbers. For example:
* Apples
** Red delicious
** Granny Smith
* Oranges
** Navel
** Clementine

h3. Links
With TEXTILE, you can easily add links to your text by using brackets and parentheses. For example:
"Visit our website":http://www.example.com

h3. Images
TEXTILE makes it simple to insert images into your text by using exclamation marks and parenthesis. For example:
!http://www.exampleimage.com/image.jpg!

h3. Tables
Creating tables in TEXTILE is also straightforward. Simply use vertical bars (|) to separate columns and dashes (-) to separate rows. For example:

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation |
| John | 28 | Programmer |
| Amy | 32 | Designer |

h3. Conclusion
TEXTILE is a powerful and user-friendly markup language that makes formatting text easy and efficient. With a few simple symbols, you can greatly enhance the readability and presentation of your written content.
