h1. Welcome to My Blog
p. This is my first blog post, and I'll be sharing some of my favorite coding tricks in this post.
p. Let's start with a simple example, printing "Hello, World!" in various programming languages:
| Language       | Code                  | Output                |
|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Java           | `` `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` `` | Hello, World! |
| Python         | `` `print("Hello, World!")` `` | Hello, World! |
| HTML           | `` `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>` `` | Hello, World! |
p. Pretty cool, right? Now let's move on to something a bit more complex.
p. Let's create a function to check if a given string is a palindrome:
bc. def is_palindrome(str):
bc.    if str == str[::-1]:
bc.        return True
bc.    else:
bc.        return False
p. This function checks if the given string is equal to its reversed version, and returns True if it is a palindrome and False if it isn't.
p. Now let's test our function with a few different strings:
| String         | Output                |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| racecar        | True                  |
| kayak          | True                  |
| computer       | False                 |
p. And there you have it! A simple coding trick and a slightly more complex function, all in one blog post.
