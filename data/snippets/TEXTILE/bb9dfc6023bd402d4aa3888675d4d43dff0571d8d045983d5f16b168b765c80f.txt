h1. Hello, Welcome to my page!

p. In this tutorial, we will be going through the basics of TEXTILE and how to use it in your web development projects.

p. Textile is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write, similar to Markdown and HTML.

p. It is commonly used for formatting text, creating lists, adding links and images, and more.

h2. Basic Formatting

p. To make text bold, simply wrap it in asterisks like *this*.

p. For italics, use underscore characters like _this_.

p. You can also combine them for bold and italics, *like _this_*.

h2. Lists

p. There are two types of lists in Textile: ordered and unordered.

p. To create an ordered list, use numbers followed by a period, like #. Item 1 or #. Item 2.

p. For unordered lists, use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens followed by a space, like * Item 1, + Item 2, or - Item 3.

h2. Links and Images

p. To add a link, surround the text with square brackets and the URL with parentheses, like [Textile](www.example.com).

p. For images, use an exclamation mark, followed by the image URL in parentheses, and optional width and height in brackets, like !(www.example.com/image.jpg)(300x200)!

h2. Textile Syntax Options

p. Textile allows for various syntax options to customize your text and add more functionality.

p. For example, you can include attributes for links and images, use inline code snippets with backticks, add footnotes with square brackets and carets, and more.
