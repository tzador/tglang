"How do I create a numbered list in Textile?"
# Textile Numbered List Example
# Make sure the number symbol is followed by a space
# The numbers will automatically be incremented
# For nested lists, add additional number symbols
# * for bullet points, instead of numbers
# Only numbers will be incremented, not bullet points
