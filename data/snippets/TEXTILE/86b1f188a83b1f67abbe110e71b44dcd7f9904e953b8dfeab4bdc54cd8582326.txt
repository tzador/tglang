h1. Introduction

The following is a complex and multi-line code snippet written in Textile markup language.

p. This example shows how to create a table using Textile markup. It includes multiple rows and columns, as well as text formatting.

|_. Name  |_. Age |_. Occupation
| John    | 32   | Programmer
| Jane    | 28   | Designer
| Mark    | 35   | Engineer

h2. Code Explanation

The first line denotes the title of the table, using the "h1" header tag in Textile. Following that is a paragraph tag "p", followed by the actual table markup using the table header "|_" and table cell "|". The underscore "_" denotes the header row, and the vertical bar "|" denotes the starting and ending of each cell.

For the table data, we have three columns, "Name", "Age", and "Occupation", each marked with a header row using the "._" syntax. Then, we have three rows, each starting with a pipe "|" and followed by the data separated by a pipe.

h2. Text Formatting

In Textile, we can also format text using special characters and tags. For example, using "*", we can make text bold and using "_" we can make it italic. We can also use " h2. " to denote a subheading in our code explanation section.

h2. Conclusion

This code snippet showcases some of the basic features of Textile markup language, including tables, text formatting, and headings. It can be used for creating visually appealing and structured documents and web pages.
