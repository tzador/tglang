table. |_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |
|Row 1 | Text in <span>*</span> Textile | Textile is *easy to use* |
|Row 2 | "Multiline &aacute - - "  | Textile provides _consistent_ formatting options. |

Explanation:
This code snippet is creating a table in TEXTILE markup language with two columns and two rows. The first row contains formatted text using the <span> tag and the * emphasis tag. The second row contains a string with special characters and another formatted text using the _ emphasis tag. The table is annotated using the vertical bar (|) to separate columns and the tilde (~) to denote the alignment of the text (left by default). The first row also uses the header markup (|_) to create a header for each column. This code showcases the use of different formatting options in the TEXTILE language and demonstrates its ease of use and consistency.
