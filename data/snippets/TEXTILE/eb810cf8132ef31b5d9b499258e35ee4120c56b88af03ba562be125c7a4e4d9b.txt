h1. Welcome to My Website
p. This is a paragraph of text in *TEXTILE* markup language. It is used for formatting and styling text in plain text editors and content management systems.
bq. In this example, we will be creating a table using *TEXTILE*.
||_. Column 1 ||_. Column 2 ||_. Column 3 ||
| Row 1 | *Bold text* | Normal Text |
| Row 2 | _Italicized text_ | Text with *bold and _italicized_ formatting* |
| Row 3 | @Code snippet@ | `Inline code` and "Image link":https://example.com/image.png |

h2. Another Heading

p. This is a second paragraph of text. It will be formatted differently than the first paragraph because we will use some advanced *TEXTILE* features.

bq.. Alignment is *important* when creating tables. In this example, we will align our columns to the left, center, and right.

|_^_. Left Aligned || _^_. Center Aligned || _^_. Right Aligned ||
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |

p. We can also use *TEXTILE* to create numbered and bulleted lists.
* First Item
* Second Item
* Third Item
