h1. Welcome to the Textile Language Guide!

p(style="color:blue; font-size: 18px;") Hello, and welcome to the Textile Language Guide. This guide will teach you the basics of Textile, a simple markup language that can be used for formatting text on websites and in documents.

p. Textile is easy to learn and use, and is a great alternative to more complex markup languages like HTML. Let's get started!

h2. Text Formatting

span(style="font-weight:bold;") Italic

p. To make text italic in Textile, simply surround it with single underscores, like _this_. You can also use the shortcut asterisks like *this*. Both options will produce the same result.

span(style="font-weight:bold;") Bold

p. To make text bold in Textile, simply surround it with double underscores, like __this__. You can also use the shortcut asterisks twice, like **this**. Again, both options will produce the same result.

span(style="font-weight:bold;") Underline

p. To underline text in Textile, simply surround it with plus signs, like +this+. This is a unique feature of Textile that is not present in other markup languages.

span(style="font-weight:bold;") Strikethrough

p. To strikethrough text in Textile, simply surround it with tilde symbols, like ~this~. This is a helpful feature for indicating deleted or outdated information.

h2. Lists

ol.
li. Item 1
li. Item 2
li. Item 3

p. To create an ordered list, simply use the "ol" tag, and then use the "li" tag to create list items. You can also use parenthesis to number the items, like so:

(1) First item
(2) Second item
(3) Third item

h3. Nested Lists

ul. 
li. List item 1
li. List item 2
ul. 
li. Nested item 1
li. Nested item 2
li. Nested item 3
li. List item 3

p. You can also nest lists in Textile by using the "ul" or "ol" tags inside of an "li" tag.

h2. Links

"This is a link to Textile.com":http://textile.com

p. To create a link in Textile, simply put the link text in quotes, followed by a colon, and then the URL of the link. This will automatically create a hyperlink.

h2. Images

!Image Alt Text!:http://imageurl.com

p. Similar to links, to add an image in Textile, put the alt text in exclamation marks, followed by a colon and the URL of the image. Note that the image must be hosted online in order for it to display properly.

h2. Tables

|_. Col 1 |_. Col 2 |

| Cell 1 | Cell 2 |
| Cell 3 | Cell 4 |

p. Tables can be created in Textile using pipes ("|"), underscores ("_"), and periods ("."). The first row will contain the column headers, and the subsequent rows will contain the data for each row. Tables can also have a different number of columns in each row.

h2. Block quotes

bq. This is a block quote in Textile. Use the "bq" tag to create a block quote.

p. That's it for our introduction to Textile! Keep practicing and exploring the language to become a Textile pro. Happy coding!
