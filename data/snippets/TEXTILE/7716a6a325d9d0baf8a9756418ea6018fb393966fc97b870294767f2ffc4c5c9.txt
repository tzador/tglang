h2. This is a h2 heading
h3. This is a h3 heading
h4. This is a h4 heading

==h2. This is a h2 heading
===h3. This is a h3 heading
====h4. This is a h4 heading
=====h5. This is a h5 heading
======h6. This is a h6 heading

h2. Links

p. To create a link, use the "link text":URL format, where "link text" is the text you want to display and URL is the URL you want to link to. For example:

"This is a link":http://www.example.com

p. To add different styles to a link, use the following format:

"Link with a red color":http://www.example.com(color:red)
"Underlined link":http://www.example.com(text-decoration:underline)
"Bold link":http://www.example.com(font-weight:bold)

h2. Lists

p. To create a bulleted list, use an asterisk (*) before each item. To create a numbered list, use a hash (#) before each item. For example:

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
# First item
# Second item
# Third item

p. To create nested list items, indent the asterisk or hash by adding a space before it. For example:

* First item
  ** Nested item
  ** Another nested item
* Second item
  ** Nested item
  ** Another nested item

h2. Images

p. To insert an image, use the following format:

!{image URL}(width:100px, align:left or right)

p. You can also add alt text to the image by adding it after the URL, within parentheses. For example:

!{image URL}(alt text)(width:100px, align:left)

h2. Tables

p. To create a table, use the following format:

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
| Row 1 | Row 1 | Row 1 |
| Row 2 | Row 2 | Row 2 |
| Row 3 | Row 3 | Row 3 |

p. To align the content in each cell, use colons before and after the header cell separator (|_). For example:

|_. Left-aligned column |_. Center-aligned column |_. Right-aligned column |
|:---|:---:|---:|
| Row 1 | Row 1 | Row 1 |
| Row 2 | Row 2 | Row 2 |
| Row 3 | Row 3 | Row 3 |
