"Here is a sample code snippet in Textile markup language:

h1. My Code Snippet

Here is a simple block of code:

bc. <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

And here is a table:

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |
|Row 1|Row 2|
|Row 3|Row 4|

Now let's add some formatting:

bq. This is a blockquote.

*This is italicized text.*

We can also add links:

"Link to Google":http://www.google.com

Finally, let's add some code highlighting:

bc. javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}

That's all for this snippet. Happy coding!"
