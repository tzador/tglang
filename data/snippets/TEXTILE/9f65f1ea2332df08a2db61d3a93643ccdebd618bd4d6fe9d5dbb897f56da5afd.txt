^NOTE: This is a long and complex code snippet in TEXTILE language.

h1. Welcome to My Website

p. Hello and welcome to my website! There are many features and functionalities that I have implemented using TEXTILE, a markup language that allows for easy formatting of text and content.

bq. Block quotes are a great way to emphasize important information or quotes from others. With TEXTILE, it is as simple as adding a 'bq.' tag at the beginning of the line.

p. Let's get started and look at some more advanced formatting options.

* _Bold and italic text_ can be achieved by wrapping the text in asterisks and underscores, respectively. 
* @Underlined text@ is achieved using the '@' symbol at the beginning and end of the text. 
* +Strikethrough text+ can be achieved using the '+' symbol at the beginning and end of the text. 
* ^Superscripts^ and ,,subscripts,, are as easy as adding the ^ and ,, characters before and after the text, respectively.

p. Lists can also be easily created using TEXTILE. 
# The first item in the list is preceded by a '#' symbol. 
# The second item can be preceded by a '*' or '-'. 
# Sub-lists can be created using indentation with ' '..' characters. 
....# This is a sub-item. 
....# Another sub-item.

p. Images can also be included in TEXTILE. 
p(align). !https://example.com/image.jpg(A sample image caption)!

p. Tables can be created using TEXTILE as well. 
|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 | 
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 | 
| Cell 3 | Cell 4 |

p. Links are easy to add using TEXTILE. 
"Home page":https://www.example.com is achieved using the link text followed by the URL after a colon.

p. Overall, TEXTILE is a powerful and versatile markup language that can be easily implemented to enhance the appearance and readability of any website. Thank you for taking the time to explore this code snippet!
