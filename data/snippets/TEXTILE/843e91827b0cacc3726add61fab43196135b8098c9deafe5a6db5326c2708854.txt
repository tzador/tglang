h1. Welcome to my Textile Code Snippet

p. This code snippet will showcase the power and complexity of Textile markup language.

bq. Textile is a lightweight markup language that can be used to easily format text for web pages.

p(#code). Here is an example of how to style text in Textile:

* *bold text*
_italic text_
+ underlined text +
- crossed out text -

p(#tables). Tables can also be created using Textile, like the one below:

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation |
| John | 29 | Software Engineer |
| Jane | 25 | Web Designer |
| Bob | 32 | Data Analyst |

p(#links). Textile also supports creating links:

"Google":https://www.google.com

p(#images). Images can be inserted using Textile as well:

!https://www.example.com/image.jpg!

p(#lists). Lists are easy to create in Textile, such as the one below:

# First item
# Second item
## Sub-item

p(#code-blocks). Code blocks can also be displayed using Textile:

bc{text}
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}

p. This is just a small glimpse of the many powerful features of Textile. For more information, check out the official Textile documentation.
