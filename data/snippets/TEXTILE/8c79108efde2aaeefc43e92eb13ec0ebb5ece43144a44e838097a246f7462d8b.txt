+ h3(#intro). Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation for the Textile programming language! This markup language is perfect for creating simple, elegant documents with minimal hassle.

+ h4(#syntax). Syntax

In Textile, the syntax is based on intuitive combinations of punctuation marks that help define the structure and style of your document. Here are some examples:

* Italic text: _italic_
* Bold text: *bold*
* Underlined text: +underline+

You can also use a combination of these formatting options for added emphasis, such as _*bold and italic*_. 

Lists are another important part of Textile syntax. Here's an example of an ordered list:

# First item
# Second item
# Third item

And here's an unordered list:

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
