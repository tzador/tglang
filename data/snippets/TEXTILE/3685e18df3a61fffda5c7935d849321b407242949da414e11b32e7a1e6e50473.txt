h1. Welcome to My Website!

p. This is a paragraph of text in _Textile_ format. You can *bold* and _italicize_ words easily.

bc. Code blocks are also supported in _Textile_. Here's an example:
<pre>
  <code>
    def fibonacci(x)
      if x == 0
        return 0
      elsif x == 1
        return 1
      else
        return fibonacci(x-1) + fibonacci(x-2)
      end
    end
  </code>
</pre>

bq. Blockquotes are another useful feature:
bq. "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." - Winston Churchill

ul. Unordered lists are supported as well:
* This is the first item
* This is the second item
* This is the third item

ol(#list). Ordered lists can have a starting number as well:
#1. This is the first item
#2. This is the second item
#3. This is the third item

h2. Thanks for viewing my _Textile_ code snippet! &#128521;
