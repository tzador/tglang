h1. Welcome to my Textile Program!

p(blue). This program is designed to showcase the power and flexibility of the Textile markup language. It has various features that can be used to customize your text and make it stand out.

bq. To begin, let's take a look at how we can create headers and paragraphs using Textile. The "h1." tag is used to create a large, bold header, while the "p()" tag is used to create a paragraph. You can also add modifiers, like "(blue)", to change the color of the text.

h2. Lists and Links

ul. Textile also allows you to create lists, whether they are unordered with the "ul." tag, or ordered with the "ol." tag. Links can be created using the "link:" tag, followed by the URL and desired text to be displayed. You can also add modifiers, like "(red)", to change the color of the link text.

h3. Images and Formatting

p. Textile also offers various formatting options, like bold, italic, and strikethrough, using the "b.", "i.", and "s." tags respectively. Images can be added using the "img:" tag, followed by the URL and alternate text. You can also add modifiers, like "(width: 300)", to specify the width of the image.

h4. Tables

table. Creating tables in Textile is simple and customizable. You can add headers by using the "||=" tag, and separate columns with the "|". You can also align the content within a cell using the modifiers, like "(<). CB is aligned to the center.

| Header 1 || Header 2 || Header 3 |
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3 |
| Cell 4 |<. CB | Cell 6 |

p. This is just a small snippet of what Textile is capable of. With its easy-to-learn syntax and powerful features, it's a great choice for creating visually appealing text in various projects.
