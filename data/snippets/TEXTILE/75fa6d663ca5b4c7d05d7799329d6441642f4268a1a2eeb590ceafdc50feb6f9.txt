h1. Biochemical Pathway

The following is a diagram of a biochemical pathway:

|_.Enzyme |_.Reaction |
| E1 | A + B -> C + D |
| E2 | C + E -> F + G |
| E3 | F + H -> I + J |

This pathway shows the conversion of molecules A, B, E, and H into molecules C, D, F, G, I, and J. Each enzyme catalyzes a specific reaction, producing different products.

*b*(#) *is used to emphasize* 
_each(_) molecule that is a reactant in the pathway._
_{+} *is used to indicate* 
_directed and reversible reactions._
_*italics* and -strikeout- can also be used for emphasis and deletion, respectively.

*E* -enzyme names can be emphasized and linked to reference information.
