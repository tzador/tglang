h1. Welcome to my website!
This is just a simple example of how you can use *textile* to format your website content. Textile is a markup language that allows you to easily format text without having to use HTML tags. Let's see some examples below:

h2. Formatting Text
You can use simple symbols to format your text. For example, *asterisks* will make your text bold, _underscores_ will make it italic, and -hyphens- will make it crossed out.

h2. Creating Lists
You can also create lists using simple symbols. For numbered lists, use # symbols, for bullet points, use * symbols, and for definition lists, use = symbols. For example:

# First item
* Second item
# Third item
= Definition list :: Definition

h2. Adding Links
Adding links is also very easy in Textile. Just enclose the link text in quotes followed by a colon and then the URL in parentheses. For example:

"Visit my website":(https://www.example.com)

h2. Inserting Images
To insert images, you can use the exclamation mark symbol followed by the image URL in parentheses. You can also specify the image height and width using curly braces and a colon. For example:

!https://www.example.com/image.jpg(200x300)!

h2. Tables
Textile also allows you to create tables with ease. Just use | symbols to separate columns and - symbols to separate rows. For example:

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |
| Row 1 | Row 2 |
| Row 3 | Row 4 |

h2. Blocks
Lastly, you can use blocks to add more structure to your content. Just start a line with a greater than symbol and then type your content. For example:

> This is a block of text that can be used for quotes or to separate content.

Thank you for checking out my website! I hope this simple example gives you a better understanding of how Textile works. Happy formatting!
