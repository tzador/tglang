Here's to **TEXTILE**, a markup language unlike any other,
That helps us format our text with ease and great vigor,
With headers, links, and tables, oh my!
Creating stylish and sleek documents, we will surely try!

p{text-align: justify}. TEXTILE is simple and clean,
It keeps our code tidy and makes it a breeze,
With lists, blockquotes, and code blocks galore,
It's a web developer's dream, and so much more!

_Textile_ offers commenting with double forward slash,
And images and videos with just a quick slash,
It supports footnotes and definitions too,
There's not much it can't do, it's simply too true.

|_. List item 1       |_. List item 2       |
|_. Description 1     |_. Description 2     |
|_. Description 3     |_. Description 4     |
|accordianList{      # This is an accordion list
  "List Item 1": Description 1,
  "List Item 2": Description 2,
  "List Item 3": Description 3,
  "List Item 4": Description 4
}

Blocks of code are easy, with triple backticks,
Just specify the language in single brackets,
With syntax highlighting, our code will look sharp,
And our readers will appreciate it, they won't have to squint or carp.
