h1. Complex Textile Code Snippet

p. This is a long and complex Textile code snippet that demonstrates various formatting and styling options.

p. To start, we have a heading with the h1 tag, followed by regular paragraphs with the p tag.

p. We can also add emphasis to text using the asterisks in front and behind the word. For example, *bold text* or _italicized text_. We can also use double asterisks for **strong emphasis** and double underscores for __underlined text__.

p. Next, we can include inline links using the link tag: "Link text":http://example.com. We can also add blockquotes with the bq tag:

bq. "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." - *Nelson Mandela*

p. Textile also allows us to create numbered lists using the # symbol. For example:
# First item
# Second item
# Third item

p. We can also create bullet lists using the * symbol. For example:
* First item
* Second item
* Third item

p. Additionally, Textile has a table syntax for creating tables with headers and cells. For example:
|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation |
| John | 28 | Engineer |
| Sarah | 32 | Teacher |
| David | 40 | Doctor |

p. Lastly, we can add images using the img tag, specifying the image URL and any desired styling options. For example:
!https://example.com/image.jpg(Alt Text)!

p. This concludes our complex Textile code snippet. It may seem overwhelming at first, but with practice and reference to Textile's documentation, you can easily master these formatting and styling options.
