h1. My Complex Textile Document

This is my __*complex*__ textile document that includes a number of different tags and formatting options.

p. I can use *italics*, **bold**, and ***bold italics*** by enclosing the text in single, double, or triple asterisks respectively.

p(#paragraph-one). I can also create different sized headings by adding the number of hashtags ('#') before the text. This is a level 2 heading.

bq. Blockquotes are created by using the 'bq.' tag.

!!! Note
This is an important note that I want to highlight using the '!!! Note' tag.

p(#paragraph-two). I can also insert links to other webpages using the 'link:' tag. For example, "Google":http://www.google.com is a great search engine.

h3(#subheading). I can also add tables using the 'table.' tag. Here's an example:

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |
| Row 3, Col 1 | Row 3, Col 2 | Row 3, Col 3 |

pre. I can also add code snippets using the 'pre.' tag. Here's an example:
