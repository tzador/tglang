h1. **Welcome to the TEXTILE programming language!**

This is a simple example of how to use the "TEXTILE" markup language to format text.

Below is a list of features that TEXTILE offers and how to use them.

- *Bold Text* = "This text will be bold"
- _Italic Text_ = "This text will be italicized"
- *# Lists* = "Lists in TEXTILE can be created using asterisks and hashes"
- # Line Breaks = "To create a line break, use a backslash at the end of a line."
- bq. _Blockquotes_ = "To create a blockquote, use bq. at the beginning of a new line."
- _Links_ = "To create a link, use double quotes around the link text with a colon and the URL."
- "Images":https://www.example.com/image.png = "To add an image, use double quotes followed by a colon and URL."
- + Tables = "Tables can be created using plus signs and pipes for columns"
+| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3 |

h2. **Additional Notes:**

- + _Nested Lists_ = "Nested lists can be created by adding additional asterisks or hashes"
- +> Colored text <blue> = "Colored text can be added by using angle brackets and the color name"
- |= Column 1 =| Col 2 | = Col 3 =| = "Textile allows for headers in tables by adding equals signs before and after the text."
- "Footnotes":http://www.textile.org/manual/footnotes = "To add a footnote, use double quotes followed by a colon and the footnote text."
- Textile code can also be used in "block-level":http://www.textile.org/manual/blocksyntax. areas for more complex formatting options.

h3. **That is all for this basic overview of TEXTILE!**

Thank you for using this simple example to get started with TEXTILE.
