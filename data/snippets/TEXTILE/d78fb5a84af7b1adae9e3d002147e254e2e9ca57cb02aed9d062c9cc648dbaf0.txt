h1. Welcome to the Textile language!
p. Textile is a simple markup language used for formatting plain text into structured content. Here are some examples of formatting:

bq. > Blockquotes are often used to highlight important information or quotes from other sources. 

h2. Lists
1. Numbered lists can be created by using numbers, followed by a period and a space.
# Lists can be nested by indenting with a tab.
2. Bullet points can be created by using asterisks.
* And they can also be nested.
** Just add an extra asterisk to the beginning.

h3. Links
Linking to other pages is easy with Textile. Simply use square brackets around your link text, followed by a colon and the URL.
"[Link to Google)":http://www.google.com

h4. Images
Images can also be inserted using square brackets. Simply use an exclamation mark (!) before the link text, followed by a parenthsis and the URL.
"![Alt text goes here](":http://www.example.com/image.jpg

h5. Formatting
Creating *bold text* is as easy as surrounding your text with asterisks.
_Italic text_ can be created by surrounding your text with underscores.
