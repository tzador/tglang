@pagination: 
[tag]1 Item 1 -> [/tag] 
[tag]2 Item 2 -> [/tag] 
[tag]3 Item 3 -> [/tag] 
[tag]4 Item 4 -> [/tag] 
[tag]5 Item 5 -> [/tag] 
[tag]6 Item 6 -> [/tag] 


By default, the pagination feature in TEXTILE uses a simple set of numbers to indicate the current page and the available pages. However, advanced customization options can be added using this code snippet.

The @pagination variable is declared, which will store the list of pages and their corresponding items.

Each page is declared using the [tag] tag with the page number and corresponding item. 

Finally, the [/tag] tag is used to close the declaration and move on to the next page.

Compared to the default pagination display, this code snippet allows for more customization and organization of the items on each page.
