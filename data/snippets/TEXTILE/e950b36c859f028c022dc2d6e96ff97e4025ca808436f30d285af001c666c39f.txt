p. The "h1." tag is used for creating a heading in TEXTILE and the "p." tag is used for creating a paragraph.

p. The "bc." and "bq." tags are used for creating code blocks and block quotes respectively.

p. In this example, we have used the "bc." tag to wrap our "Hello, World!" statement in a code block.

p. You can also use different styles for your code blocks by adding a language abbreviation after the "bc." tag, such as "bc-js" for JavaScript or "bc-python" for Python.

p. The "bq." tag, on the other hand, is used for creating block quotes. In our code snippet, we have used it to annotate our code and provide some explanation.

p. This is just a basic example of the TEXTILE syntax, there are many other tags and formatting options available for creating more complex code snippets.
