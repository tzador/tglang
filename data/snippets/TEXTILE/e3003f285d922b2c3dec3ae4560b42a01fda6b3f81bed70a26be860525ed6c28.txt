h1. Welcome to my Textile Code Snippet!

p. This is a long and complex code snippet written in Textile markup language. It contains various formatting options, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and inline styles.

h2(#first-section). Basic Formatting

p. Textile allows you to easily format your text using simple symbols. For example, *this text* will be shown in bold, _this text_ will be italicized, and +this text+ will be underlined.

h2(#second-section). Lists

p. Lists can be created using asterisks (\*), numbers (#), or hyphens (-). You can create nested lists by indenting the items with spaces.

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
** Nested item under third item

h2(#third-section). Links and Images

p. Hyperlinks can be added using square brackets and parentheses. For example, "[Google](https://www.google.com)". Images can be inserted using exclamation marks and parentheses. For example, "![alt text](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)". You can also add titles and insert images from a specific class.

h2(#fourth-section). Tables

p. Tables can be created using pipes (|) and hyphens (-). You can also specify alignment using colons (:).

|_.Cell 1 |_.Cell 2 |_.Cell 3 |
| 1  | 2  | 3 |
| 4  | 5  | 6 |
|_>.Centered |<.Right aligned |<.Left aligned |

h2(#fifth-section). Code Blocks

p. You can add code snippets using backticks (\`). Triple backticks can be used for multi-line code blocks.

`
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int sum = x + y;
print("The sum of x and y is " + sum);`

h2(#sixth-section). Special Textile Features

p. Textile also has special features such as footnotes, citations, and definitions. These are enclosed in double brackets (()).

((1)) Footnote example
((2)) Citation example
((3)) Definition example

h2(#seventh-section). Extended Textile Syntax

p. Textile also has extended syntax for advanced formatting options such as alignment, styling, and classes. Refer to the Textile documentation for more information.

h2(#eighth-section). Conclusion

p. This concludes our Textile code snippet. Thank you for reading and I hope you found it helpful! Feel free to experiment with Textile's many features and create your own beautifully formatted documents.
