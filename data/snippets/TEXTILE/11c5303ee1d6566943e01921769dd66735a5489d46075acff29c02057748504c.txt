h1(#main-header). Welcome to my Textile Code Snippet!

p(Textile is a simple markup language for creating structured documents. It is similar to Markdown, but has additional features and is used in different contexts.)

bq. Textile supports basic formatting, such as *bold*, _italics_, and -strikethrough-.

p(Textile also has advanced formatting options, such as creating tables and adding footnotes.)

h2. Basic Formatting

p(Below is an example of how to use basic formatting in Textile:)

bc. *This text is bold*

p(You can also combine formatting options, such as:)

bc. _This text is both italicized and bold_

h2. Table

table(Table Title). 

|_. First Name |_. Last Name |_. Age |
| John | Smith | 25 |
| Sarah | Johnson | 35 |

p(Tables in Textile allow you to organize data in a structured manner. You can add table titles, column headings, and even merge cells.)

h2. Footnotes

p(A footnote is additional information or reference added at the bottom of a page. In Textile, you can add footnotes by using the following syntax:)

bc. This is a sentence with a footnote(^1^).

fn1. This is the footnote content.

p(In the above example, the footnote number is placed between two carets, and the actual footnote content is placed below the main text.)

h2. Code Snippets

p(Textile also supports inserting code snippets into documents. You can use the following syntax to add a code snippet:)

bc. `This is a code snippet in Textile.`

p(Textile will automatically format the code and display it in a monospace font for clearer differentiation from regular text.)

h2. Links

p(Textile allows you to easily add links to your documents. You can use the following syntax:)

bc. "Link Text":https://www.example.com

p(In the above example, the link text is placed in quotation marks, followed by a colon and the URL to be linked.)

p(These are just some of the advanced features of Textile. For more examples and information, please refer to the official Textile documentation.)
