h1. Welcome to my Textile Website

p. This is a paragraph on my website created using Textile markup language. It is a simple and easy-to-use language for formatting and styling text.

p(#paragraph-1). You can add formatting to your text by using symbols and keywords. For example, *bold text* or _italic text_.

p(#paragraph-2). Textile also allows you to create lists, such as bulleted lists:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

p(#paragraph-3). You can also add links to your text using the link syntax, like this "{http://www.example.com Example}":http://www.example.com

p(#paragraph-4). Another useful feature of Textile is the ability to add images to your text, using the image syntax, like this "{image.jpg Image}":image.jpg

p(#paragraph-5). If you want to add headers or subheaders to your website, you can use the h1-h6 syntax, like this "h2(#header-2). Subheader":http://www.example.com

p(#paragraph-6). Lastly, Textile allows you to create tables with ease, using the pipe symbol and dashes to separate columns and rows. For example:

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |
| Row 1      | Row 1      |
| Row 2      | Row 2      |
| Row 3      | Row 3      |

p(#paragraph-7). With Textile, you can create a professional-looking website without the hassle of complex coding. Try it out for yourself and see the magic of Textile in action!
