# Complex Code Example in Textile

*This is a complex code example in Textile*


h1. Efficiency Calculator

| Day | Hours Worked | Efficiency (%) |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Monday | 8 | 75% |
| Tuesday | 7 | 85% |
| Wednesday | 9 | 90% |
| Thursday | 6 | 80% |
| Friday | 10 | 95% |
| Saturday | 8 | 75% |
| Sunday | 5 | 70% |

p. *To calculate the total efficiency:*


bc.. ((75 + 85 + 90 + 80 + 95 + 75 + 70)/7) = 82.86%


h2. Average Efficiency

p. The average efficiency for the week is 82.86%. However, this can be broken down further:

| Category | Average (%) |
| ------------- | -----:|
| High Efficiency | 90% |
| Medium Efficiency | 80% |
| Low Efficiency	 | 70% |

p. *To calculate the efficiency of each category:*

bc.. (90 + 80 + 70)/3 = 80%

p. Therefore, the week had an overall efficiency of *82.86%,* with *80%* of time spent in either high, medium, or low efficiency.

p. In conclusion, the efficiency calculator allows us to track our productivity and make improvements to maximize our efficiency. Thank you for using Textile!
