h1. Introduction
Welcome to the *TEXTILE* programming language!

h2. Variables
Variables in *TEXTILE* are declared using the '@' symbol, followed by the variable name and an equals sign.
They can store strings, numbers, or booleans.

@name = "John Smith"
@age = 25
@is_cool = true

h2. Functions
Functions in *TEXTILE* are defined with 'def' followed by the function name and parentheses for parameters.
The body of the function is denoted by curly braces, and return values are indicated with the '>>' arrow.

def square(x)
    {x * x} >> result

h2. Loops
Loops in *TEXTILE* use 'for' followed by a variable name preceded by a pipe symbol, and the range or collection to loop through.
The body of the loop is denoted by curly braces.

for |i| in (1..10)
    {i} >> index

h2. Conditional Statements
Conditional statements in *TEXTILE* use 'if' followed by a condition and curly braces for the body.
'else' and 'elsif' can also be used for additional conditions.

if @age >= 18
    {"You are an adult."} >> output
elsif @age >= 13
    {"You are a teenager."} >> output
else
    {"You are a child."} >> output

h2. String Concatenation
In *TEXTILE*, strings can be concatenated using the '+' sign between them.

"I am " + @age + " years old." >> output
