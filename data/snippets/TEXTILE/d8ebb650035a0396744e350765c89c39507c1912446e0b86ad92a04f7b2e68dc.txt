h1. Welcome to the Textile language!
This is a basic example of Textile markup.

p. To create a heading, use the 'h1.' tag followed by the content of the heading. 
For example, <span class="code">h1. This is a heading</span> would produce:

h1. This is a heading

p(#paragraph). Paragraphs can be created using the 'p.' tag followed by the content of the paragraph. For example, <span class="code">p. This is a paragraph</span> would produce:

p. This is a paragraph

*bold*. Text can be made bold by surrounding it with asterisks. For example, <span class="code">*This text is bold*</span> would produce:

*This text is bold*

_blue_. Custom colors can be used by defining them within the tag. For example, <span class="code">_blue(This text is blue)_</span> would produce:

_blue(This text is blue)_

bq. Blockquotes can be created using the 'bq.' tag followed by the content of the quote. For example, <span class="code">bq. This is a quote</span> would produce:

bq. This is a quote

h2. Lists
Lists can be created using the 'ul.' and 'ol.' tags for unordered and ordered lists respectively.

ul. List item 1
ul. List item 2
ul. List item 3

ol. List item 1
ol. List item 2
ol. List item 3

p(#link). Links can be created using the 'link:' tag followed by the link URL and the link text. For example, <span class="code">link:http://www.example.com[Example]</span> would produce:

link:http://www.example.com[Example] 

h2(#code). Code blocks can be created using the 'code.' tag followed by the code language, opening and closing tags, and the code content. For example, <span class="code">code.[html]<html><body><h1>This is a heading</h1></body></html></span> would produce:

code.[html]<html><body><h1>This is a heading</h1></body></html>
