h7. Code Snippets

bc.. p { 
  color: red; 
  font-size: 16px; 
}

bc. javascript
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

h8. Footnotes

p. You can add footnotes to provide additional information. For example, here's a reference to a source.^1

h9. Nested Formatting

p. You can also have nested formatting in TEXTILE, such as bold and italic text. For example, *this is bold and _this is bold and italic_ text*.

h10. Preformatted Text

p(class: code). If you want to display preformatted text in TEXTILE, you can use the following syntax:

bq. p(class: code). This is preformatted text.

h11. Escaping Characters

p(class: escape). To use characters that have special meaning in TEXTILE, you can escape them using a backslash. For example, if you want to display an asterisk, you would write "\*".

h12. Block Elements

np. TEXTILE also has block elements, such as paragraphs, headings, and lists. These elements start on a new line and are separated from the surrounding text by a blank line.
