h2. Textile Introduction
Textile is a simple markup language that allows you to quickly format and style your text. It supports basic text formatting, such as bold, italic, and underlined text, as well as more complex features like tables, lists, and images. It is designed to be easy to read and write, making it a popular choice for documentation and simple web pages.
h3. Basic Text Formatting
To make text bold, wrap it in asterisks (*). For example, *This text will be bold*. To make text italic, wrap it in underscores (_). For example, _This text will be italic_. To make text underlined, wrap it in plus signs (+). For example, +This text will be underlined+.
h3. Lists
There are two types of lists in Textile: ordered and unordered. To create an ordered list, start each line with a number followed by a period. For example,
# First item
# Second item
# Third item
To create an unordered list, start each line with an asterisk and a space. For example,
* First item
* Second item
* Third item
h3. Tables
Tables in Textile are created using pipe symbols (|) and hyphens (-). Each row should start and end with a pipe symbol, and the hyphens represent column dividers. For example,
|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |
| Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 |
h3. Images
To insert an image in Textile, use the following format: !image_url!. For example, !https://example.com/image.png! will insert an image from the given URL.
h3. Links
To create a link in Textile, use the following format: "link text":link_url. For example, "Visit Google":https://www.google.com will create a link with the text "Visit Google" that links to the Google homepage.
h3. Blockquote
To create a blockquote in Textile, start the line with a greater than symbol (>). For example,
> This is a blockquote.
> It can have multiple lines.
