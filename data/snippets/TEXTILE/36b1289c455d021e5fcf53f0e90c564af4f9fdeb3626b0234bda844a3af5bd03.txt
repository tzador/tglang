Welcome to my blog!

h1. My First Blog Post

This is my *first* blog post using the _Textile_ markup language. It is **super** easy to use and allows me to easily style my posts.

h2. Subheadings are a breeze

I love how simple it is to create subheadings with Textile. Just use the "@" symbol at the beginning of the line and it automatically creates a heading!

h3. Adding links is a snap

Adding links in Textile is as easy as writing out the URL next to the text you want to link. For example, "Check out my portfolio":https://www.example.com/portfolio.

h4. Styling text is a cinch

With Textile, I can easily make text bold, italic, or underlined just by adding * for bold, _ for italic, and + for underline.

h5. Creating lists is a piece of cake

I can create both bulleted and numbered lists with ease using Textile.

* Textile
* Markdown
* HTML

1. Github
2. Bitbucket
3. Gitlab

h6. Code snippets are a walk in the park

Textile makes it simple to insert code snippets into my posts. Just surround the code with "@@" and it will be displayed in a monospaced font.

@@
// This is a code snippet in JavaScript
var greeting = "Welcome to my blog!";
console.log(greeting);
@@

Lastly, I can add images to my posts using Textile by simply adding an exclamation mark and the image URL like this:
