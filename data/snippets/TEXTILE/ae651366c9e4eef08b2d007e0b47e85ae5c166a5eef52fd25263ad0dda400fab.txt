 h2. Introduction:
 The purpose of this blog is to share my knowledge and experiences with others. I hope you find it helpful and informative.
 
 *Please note that this blog is written using Textile markup language.
 
 p. In today's post, I will be discussing the basics of Textile and how you can use it to format your blog posts.
 
 h3. Text Formatting:
 I will start by showing you how to format text in Textile. You can use asterisks (*) for bold text, underscores (_) for italics, and hyphens (-) for ~strikethrough~. For example:
 
 *This text is in bold*
 _This text is in italics_
 -This text is ~strikethrough~
 
 h3. Headings:
 To create headings in Textile, simply add the letter 'h' followed by the number of the heading level (1-6). For example:
 
 h1. This is a level 1 heading
 h3. This is a level 3 heading
 
 h3. Lists:
 Textile supports both ordered and unordered lists. To create an ordered list, simply start each item with a number followed by a period. To create an unordered list, start each item with an asterisk (*). 
 For example: 
 
 # Item 1
 # Item 2
 # Item 3
 * Item A
 * Item B
 * Item C
 
 h3. Links:
 In Textile, you can easily create links by using the 'link text':url syntax. For example: 
 
 "Blog title":https://www.example.com
 
 h3. Images:
 To insert images in Textile, you can use the exclamation mark (!) followed by the image URL. For example:
 
 !https://www.example.com/image.jpg!
 
 h3. Code Blocks:
 Using triple backticks, you can create a code block in Textile. For example:
