h1. **Welcome to the TEXTILE programming language!**

p. Textile is a plain text formatting language that is used to create formatted text documents. It is an easy-to-learn markup language that is designed to be used by both technical and non-technical users.

h2(section#id). _Getting Started_

div(#instructions).
*First*, you will need to install a TEXTILE parser on your computer. This will allow you to convert your plain text file into a formatted document.

*Second*, create a new file with the ".textile" file extension. This will indicate to your parser that it is a Textile document.

*Third*, start writing your document using TEXTILE's simple and intuitive formatting syntax. For example, to create a heading, use the h1-h6 tags followed by a period and a space, then add your heading text.

h2(section#syntax). _Syntax and Formatting_

h3. *Headings*
h4(#h4-id). For nested headings, you can add an id to specify a unique identifier for the heading.

h3. *Emphasis*
p. You can make text *italic* by surrounding it with single asterisks, **bold** with double asterisks, and __underlined__ with double underscores.

h3. *Links*
p. Textile has a simple way to format links, using square brackets for the link text followed by a colon and the URL in parentheses. For example: "Code Snippet":(https://www.example.com/).

h3. *Lists*
p. Create unordered lists by using asterisks at the beginning of each line. You can also create ordered lists using numbers followed by periods.

p. * Nested lists are also possible by indenting using tab or spaces.

h3. *Images*
p. Add images to your document using the image tag, followed by a colon and the image URL in parentheses. You can also add id and class attributes.

h3. *Tables*
p. Tables in Textile are created using pipes "|" to separate columns and hyphens "-" to create the table header.

p. * You can also specify alignment and styling for table columns using colons after the hyphen.

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
| row1col1 | row1col2 | row1col3 |
| row2col1 | row2col2 | row2col3 |
