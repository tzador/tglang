h1(#header). Welcome to my textile code snippet!

p.
  This is an annotated markdown code
  snippet that shows how to use TEXTILE
  language to style text and create lists.

p(#paragraph).
  TEXTILE uses simple symbols to style text.
  For example, *this text will be bold* and
  _this text will be italic_.

h2(#list-header). Creating lists in TEXTILE

ul.
  This is an unordered list in TEXTILE
  * First item
  * Second item
  * Third item

ol(#ordered-list).
  This is an ordered list in TEXTILE
  # First item
  # Second item
  # Third item

h3(#link-header). Adding links in TEXTILE

p(#link-paragraph).
  To add a link in TEXTILE, use the following format: 
  "Link Text":linkurl.
  For example, "Check out my website":https://www.example.com 
  will create a link to my website with the text "Check out my website".

h4(#table-header). Creating tables in TEXTILE

table(#example-table).
  |_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
  | Example 1  | Content 1  | Other 1    |
  | Example 2  | Content 2  | Other 2    |
  | Example 3  | Content 3  | Other 3    |

p(#table-paragraph).
  The table above shows the basic structure for creating tables in TEXTILE.
  The symbol "|" is used to separate columns and "_. " is used to add column headings.
  To add rows, simply add multiple lines with the columns separated by "|" as shown in the example.

h5(#image-header). Adding images in TEXTILE

img(#example-image). imageurl(image-title).
p(#image-paragraph).
  The code above will insert an image with the specified URL and title.
  The "img(#example-image)" creates a reference to the image that can be used in multiple places, while the "imageurl(image-title)" specifies the actual image link and adds a title to the image.
