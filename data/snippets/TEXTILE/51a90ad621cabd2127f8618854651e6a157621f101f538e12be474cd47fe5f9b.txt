h1. Welcome to my Textile code snippet!

bq. This is a great way to add a block quote to your snippet!

p. @This is a paragraph with some _italics_ and *bold* text.@

h3. Lists are easy to create in Textile:
# This is an ordered list item.
# Another ordered list item.
#* This is a nested unordered list item.
#* Another nested unordered list item.

p. @Here is some code that has been highlighted using syntax highlighting:
bc#.This is a code block in C# language.
int num = 5;
string str = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine("The value of num is: " + num.ToString());
Console.WriteLine("The value of str is: " + str);@

p. Creating tables in Textile is simple too:
|Title | Author | Genre |
|Hunger Games | Suzanne Collins | YA adventure |
|Pride and Prejudice | Jane Austen | Classic romance |
|Harry Potter | J.K. Rowling | Fantasy adventure |
