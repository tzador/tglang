/*
In the first line, we use a pipe character (|) to indicate the start and end of each table cell.
The underscore and period combination (|_.) creates a header cell that is centered and bold.
The double asterisks (**bold**) add emphasis to the header text.
In each subsequent row, we have a pipe followed by the product name, price, and description separated by more pipes.
This creates a row with three columns: product name, price, and description.
At the end of each row, we use a pipe to indicate the end of the table row.
