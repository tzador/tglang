h1. Welcome to My Textile Page!

p. This is a paragraph of text in my Textile page. You can use *bold*, _italic_, and -strikethrough- formatting in Textile.

bc.. This is a block code snippet in Textile.
Code snippets can also be formatted using the @{}@ syntax. Example:
@{ <?php
    echo "Hello, World!";
?> }@

Not only text can be formatted in Textile, but also lists:
- This is the first item in a bulleted list
- This is the second item
- And this is the third item

Or you can use numbered lists:
# This is the first item in a numbered list
# This is the second item
# And this is the third item

Textile also allows for basic tables:
|_. Name |_. Age |_. Location |
| Adam | 25 | New York |
| Emily | 28 | Los Angeles |
| Jack | 22 | Chicago |

You can also add links in Textile:
"This is a link to Google":http://www.google.com

And images:
