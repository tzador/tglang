h1. Welcome to my Textile code!

p. This is an example of a long and complex Textile code snippet. It demonstrates multiple features of the language and showcases its versatility.

bc.. Code blocks can be inserted using the "bc." tag. The following code will be displayed in a fixed-width font:

bc. #include <iostream>
int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}

h2. Text Formatting

p. Text can be formatted using various tags such as *bold*, _italic_, +underlined+, and -strikethrough-.

h3. Lists

p. Lists can be created using the "*" or "#" tags. Sub-lists can be created by adding additional "*", "#" or ":" symbols.

* This is a bulleted list item
* This is another bulleted list item
** This is a sub-list item
** This is another sub-list item
*** This is a sub-sub-list item
## This is a numbered list item
## This is another numbered list item
:: This is a sub-list item
:: This is another sub-list item
:::: This is a sub-sub-list item

h3. Tables

p. Tables can be created using the '|' symbol to separate columns and the '-' symbol to create a header row. The following code creates a table with three columns and three rows:

|_. Column 1|_. Column 2|_. Column 3|
| Row 1 | Row 1, Column 2 | Row 1, Column 3 |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 | Row 2, Column 3 |
| Row 3, Column 1 | Row 3, Column 2 | Row 3, Column 3 |

h3. Links and Images

p. Links can be created using the "[" and "]" symbols, and images can be inserted using the "!" symbol followed by the link. The following code creates a link to Google and inserts an image of a cat:

[Link to Google|https://www.google.com/]

h3. Attributes and Classes

p. Attributes and CSS classes can be added to elements using the "{" and "}" symbols. The following code creates a paragraph with a custom class and attribute:

p(class="custom-class"{data-id="123"}) This is a paragraph with a custom class and attribute.

h3. Blocks

p. Blocks can be created using the "bq." tag. The following code creates a blockquote:

bq. This is a blockquote.

h3. Comments

p. Comments can be added using the "//" symbol. The following code is a comment:

// This is a comment that will not be displayed in the output.

h3. Advanced Features

p. Textile also has advanced features such as macros, footnotes, and inline code blocks. Check out the Textile documentation for more information on these features!
