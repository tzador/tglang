h1. Welcome to the Textile Language!

p. Textile is a markup language that is designed to be simple to read and write. It uses
a combination of simple text formatting to create structured documents. Let's see some
examples of Textile formatting:

*This is italicized text.*

**This is bold text.**

_This is underlined text._

bc. This is a block of code.

> This is a block quote.

# This is a numbered list:
# Item 1
# Item 2

* This is a bullet list:
* Item A
* Item B

h2. Links and Images

Textile also allows you to easily add links and images to your document.

Link to "Google":http://www.google.com

Image: !http://example.com/image.jpg!

h2. Tables

Tables can be created in Textile by using pipe delimiting for each cell.

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 |
| Cell 3 | Cell 4 |

h2. Advanced Formatting

Textile also allows for more advanced formatting, such as creating footnotes and inserting
custom classes and IDs.

fn1. This is a footnote.

p(class#custom-class). This paragraph has a custom class and ID.

h2. Escaping

Textile allows you to escape characters that would normally be interpreted as formatting,
using a backslash. For example, to show an asterisk instead of italicizing text, you
would use "\*". Similarly, to show a pipe instead of creating a table, you would use
"\|".
