h1. Welcome to my Textile document!

This is a paragraph with some *bold text* and some _italic text_.

This is a list:
* Item 1
** Subitem 1
** Subitem 2
* Item 2

I am using _underscores_ to create a _hyperlink_ to my website:
_mywebsite.com_

bq. This is a block quote that is indented and styled differently.

I am using _asterisks_ to create _strong text_ in this paragraph.

This is a table:
|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3 |
| Cell 4 | Cell 5 | Cell 6 |
| Cell 7 | Cell 8 | Cell 9 |

h2. Thanks for reading!
