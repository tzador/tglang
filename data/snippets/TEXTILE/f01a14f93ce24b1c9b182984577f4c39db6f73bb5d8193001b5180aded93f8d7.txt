h1. Welcome to My Website!

This is a paragraph of *textile* markup._

This is *also a paragraph*, but with some _emphasized text_ using the 'em' tag.

h2. What is TEXTILE?

TEXTILE is a simple markup language used for formatting text and structuring content. It is primarily used in web development and is often considered an alternative to HTML.

You can use *asterisks* or _underscores_ to add emphasis to your text, and you can also combine them for **strong emphasis**.

h3. Lists

Lists can be created using the 'ul' or 'ol' tag, followed by 'li' elements for each item in the list.

* This is a bulleted list item.
* This is another bulleted list item.
* And here is a third bulleted list item.

# This is a numbered list item.
# This is another numbered list item.
# And here is a third numbered list item.

h4. Links

You can add links to your textile markup using the 'a' tag, with the 'href' attribute for the URL and the 'title' attribute for the link title.

"GitHub":http://github.com "Check out GitHub for code snippets and more!"

h5. Images

To add images, use the 'img' tag with the 'src' attribute for the image source and the 'alt' attribute for alternative text.

!http://example.com/image.jpg!

h6. Blockquotes

Use the 'bq' tag for blockquotes. You can also add citations using the 'cite' tag.

bq. "To be, or not to be? That is the question." - William Shakespeare

h7. Tables

Tables can be created using the 'table' tag, with 'tr' tags for each row and 'td' tags for the data in each cell.

| Table Header 1 | Table Header 2 |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Data 1         | Data 2         |
| Data 3         | Data 4         |

h8. Code

To add code snippets, use the 'pre' tag with the 'code' tag inside it. You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting using the 'class' attribute.

pre(class="ruby").
def my_method
  puts "Hello, world!"
end

h9. Escaping

If you need to include characters that are reserved in textile markup, you can escape them using the backslash ('\') character.

This is a paragraph with some reserved \*characters\* that will be displayed as-is.

h10. Comments

Comments in textile markup can be added using the '//' syntax.

// This is a comment in textile markup. It will not be rendered in the output.
