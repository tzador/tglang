This code snippet is used to create a basic table in TEXTILE, including headers and data rows. The first line specifies the formatting for the table headers, using the |_. syntax. The following lines use the | separator to designate separate columns, and then list the data values for each row. The output would look something like this:

---
| Name     | Size   | Color |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Backpack | Medium | Blue  |
| Shoes    | Small  | Red   |
| Socks    | Large  | Black |
