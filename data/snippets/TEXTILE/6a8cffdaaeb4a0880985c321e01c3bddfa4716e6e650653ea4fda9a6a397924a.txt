h1. Hello World

h2. Introduction

This is a sample TEXTILE code snippet that outputs a basic "Hello World" in the first line and an introduction in the second line.

p. The code starts with a standard TEXTILE header, "h1.", which is followed by the main text, "Hello World". This creates a level 1 heading in the HTML output. Below that, we have another header, "h2.", followed by the introduction text. This creates a level 2 heading in the output.

p. TEXTILE also allows for basic formatting, such as bolding and italics. To bold a word, you can use either double asterisks "**" or double underscores "__" around the word. To italicize, you can use either single asterisk "*" or single underscore "_".

bq. If you want to create a block quote, you can use the "bq." tag followed by your text. This will visually separate your text from the rest of the content.

p. Additionally, TEXTILE allows for creating lists, both numbered and bullet points.

# This is a numbered list item.
# Another numbered list item.
# And a third numbered list item.

* This is a bullet point item.
* Another bullet point item.
* And a third bullet point item.

p. For links, you can use the "link:" tag followed by your desired link. For example:

link:https://www.example.com[Visit our website]
link:http://example.com [Another link]

p. Finally, TEXTILE also supports tables. You can specify the number of columns and rows in the "table." tag, and then add your table data within the table block. For example:

|_.Column 1 |_.Column 2 |_.Column 3 |
|Row 1|Data 1|Data 2|
|Row 2|Data 3|Data 4|

p. This concludes our sample TEXTILE code snippet. Stay tuned for more examples!
