h1. Hello World! 
Welcome to the *TEXTILE* programming language. This is a long and complex code snippet that will demonstrate the power of TEXTILE. Here is an example of a list using numbered and bulleted items:

# First list item 
# Second list item 
* Bullet item one 
* Bullet item two 

p. This is a paragraph with "inline styles":https://example.com.

bq. This is a blockquote that supports _textile_ formatting.

h2. Code Snippet Example 

bc. [code language='javascript']
var num1 = 10; 
var num2 = 5; 
var sum = num1 + num2; 
console.log("The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + sum + ".");
[/code]

p. Additionally, TEXTILE allows for *bold text*, _italicized text_, and ~strikethrough text~. It also supports linking to external URLs, images, and tables. Here is an image of a dog:

img(src="https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/shiba/shiba-3.jpg" alt="Cute Shiba Inu" title="Aww")

h3. Table Example 

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Location | 
| John | 28 | New York | 
| Sarah | 35 | Los Angeles | 
| Michael | 42 | London | 

h4. Conclusion 

Thank you for taking the time to explore the *TEXTILE* language. With its simple syntax and powerful features, it can be a valuable tool for creating complex documents and web pages. Happy coding!
