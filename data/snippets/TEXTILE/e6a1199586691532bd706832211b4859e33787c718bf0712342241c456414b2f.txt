h1. **TEXTILE**

TEXTILE is a lightweight markup language used for creating well-structured and visually appealing content on the web. It is commonly used in blogs, forums, and other content management systems.

h2. *Syntax*

The syntax of TEXTILE is simple and intuitive, making it easy to learn and use. It uses a combination of symbols, tags, and plain text to format and style content.

h2. *Headings*

TEXTILE supports six levels of headings, denoted by the number of exclamation marks (!) preceding the text. The higher the number of exclamation marks, the smaller the heading. For example:

!!! h1. This is a level 1 heading
!! h2. This is a level 2 heading
! h6. This is a level 6 heading

h2. *Emphasis*

TEXTILE allows for emphasis to be added to text through the use of asterisks (*), underscores (_), and double underscore and asterisk (***) combinations. For example:

_*italic*_
**bold**
_*italic and bold*_
***bold and italic***

h2. *Lists*

TEXTILE supports both bulleted and numbered lists. Bulleted lists use asterisks (*) or hyphens (-) to denote list items, while numbered lists use a hash (#) symbol. For example:

* First item
** Sub-item 1
** Sub-item 2
- Second item
* Third item
# First numbered item
# Second numbered item

h2. *Links*

LINK:https://www.textile-lang.com/
LINK:https://www.google.com/^google
LINK:https://www.example.com/ Example

h2. *Images*

TEXTILE allows for images to be inserted using the "!" symbol, followed by the image URL and optional alt text. For example:

!https://www.example.com/image.jpg!
!https://www.example.com/image.jpg! Image caption

h2. *Code Blocks*

TEXTILE has built-in support for displaying code blocks, making it a popular choice for developers. Code blocks can be denoted by a double colon (::) at the beginning and end of the block. For example:

:::ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello World!"
end:::
