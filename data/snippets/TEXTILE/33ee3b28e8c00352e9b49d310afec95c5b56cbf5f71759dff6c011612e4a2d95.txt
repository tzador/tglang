bq. This is a complex piece of TEXTILE code that includes multiple formatting features such as *bold*, _italics_, and +strikethrough+, as well as a block quote and a numbered list:

# First item
# Second item
# Third item

bq. This is a block quote that includes a link to "Google":http://www.google.com and an image of a cat:

super cute cat

bq. This is another block quote that contains a code block with syntax highlighting and a table with three columns:

bc. {python}
def function(param1, param2):
    print("This is a python function.")
    
|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
|row 1, cell 1|row 1, cell 2|row 1, cell 3 |
|row 2, cell 1|row 2, cell 2|row 2, cell 3 |
|row 3, cell 1|row 3, cell 2|row 3, cell 3 |

bq. Here is a final block quote that shows a code block without syntax highlighting, a horizontal rule, and a paragraph of text:

&. No syntax highlighting for this code block. Just some simple code to show.

This is a paragraph of text that will be included after the code snippet. This shows how to use the various formatting features in TEXTILE to create a visually appealing and organized piece of code. Thank you for checking out this code snippet!
