NOTE: This code snippet is an example of a basic layout structure in the markup language 'TEXTILE'.
It sets the background color for the entire layout and includes a heading, list, and code snippets.
The heading is displayed as an h2 tag and the list includes three items, one of which is aligned to the right with the 'align=right' attribute.
The last two items in the list are nested, with the second one being numbered using the '#.', and the third one including code snippets within a preformatted block using the 'pre..' notation.
The NOTE section at the end is not included in the code snippet and is only provided as an explanation of the code.
