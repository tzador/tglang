Note: In Textile, the syntax for multilevel headings is h1, h2, h3, etc. followed by parentheses and an optional heading ID. The "#" symbol is used to denote an ID, and the ID is referenced later in the table of contents using "#ID". The text following the heading declaration is the title of the heading.
