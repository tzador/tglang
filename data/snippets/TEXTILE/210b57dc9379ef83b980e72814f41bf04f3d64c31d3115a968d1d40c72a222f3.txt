h1. Heading

A paragraph of *bold* and _italic_ text, with a [link]{url}, and some +underlined+ text.

bc. <div class="container">
  <h2>This is a heading in a div</h2>
  <p>With some <b>bold</b> and <em>italic</em> text.</p>
</div>

p. Another paragraph with a list:
* Item 1
* Item 2
** Nested item

This snippet demonstrates the use of various formatting options in TEXTILE. Firstly, we have a level 1 heading defined using the h1 tag. 

Next, we have a paragraph of text with various formatting options. The asterisks denote bold text, the underscore denotes italic text, and the plus sign denotes underlined text. Additionally, we have a link defined using the link tag and a specified URL. 

Finally, we have a block of code defined using the bc tag. Within the code block, we have a div container with a heading and a paragraph containing more formatting options using HTML tags. 

The snippet concludes with another paragraph containing a list, with two items and a nested item. These items are defined using the list tags and asterisks for indentation.
