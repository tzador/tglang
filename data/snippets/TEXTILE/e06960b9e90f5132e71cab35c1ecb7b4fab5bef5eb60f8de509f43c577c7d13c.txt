1. *BASIC SYNTAX*
  **This program demonstrates basic syntax in Textile language.**
  
  *Heading:* Writing in textile is easy and uses simple formatting symbols. 
  In order to create a heading, use an asterisk \* symbol before the text.

  *Italic:* To make some text italic, surround it with underscores \_like this\_.

  *Bold:* For bold text, surround it with double asterisks \*\*like this\*\*.

  *Link:* You can create links in Textile by placing the text in square brackets and 
  immediately following it with the URL in parentheses. [This is a link](https://example.com).

  *Lists:* Creating lists in Textile is similar to other markup languages. 
  For ordered lists, simply add a number followed by a period before each list item. 
  For unordered lists, use an asterisk \* or dash \- before each list item.

  *Code block:* To format a block of code, surround it with triple backticks \`\`\` 
  before and after the code block.

2. *ADVANCED SYNTAX*
  **This program demonstrates advanced syntax in Textile language.**

  *Images:* Inserting an image is similar to creating a link. 
  Use an exclamation mark \! before the square brackets and include the image URL in parentheses. 
  ![Image description](https://example.com/image.jpg).

  *Table:* Tables in Textile are created using pipes \| and dashes \- to separate columns and rows. 
  The first row is used as the table header, and the second row should include dashes \- to designate the header cells. 
  | Column 1 | Column 2 | 
  |-|-|

  *Footnotes:* Footnotes in Textile are placed using a caret ^ and include the footnote text in parentheses. 
  This is the text within the footnote[1]^Footnote text.

  *Macros and Attributes:* Textile also allows for the use of macros and attributes to add interactivity and customizability to your content. 
  Macros are added using double percent signs \%\% and attributes are placed inside curly braces \{ \}. 
  %%button{color: red; size: small}Click me%%

3. *CUSTOM TAGS*
  **This program demonstrates custom tagged syntax in Textile language.**
  
  Textile also provides the ability to create custom tags for specific formatting or styling purposes. 
  These tags can be created using double at signs \@\@ followed by the tag name and then the content enclosed in curly braces \{ \}.
  @@blockquote{font-style: italic}This is a blockquote.@@
