# The following code snippet creates a complex table in textile markup language.

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation |
| John | 28 | Developer |
| Sarah | 35 | Designer |
| Tom | 42 | Project Manager |
| Rachel | 26 | Data Analyst |


# The code starts with a header row that defines the table columns.
# '_. Name' defines the first column with a class modifier '_.' and the label 'Name'.
# The remaining columns are similarly defined with the labels 'Age' and 'Occupation'.

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation |

# The following rows define the data in each column. 
# Each row starts with the pipe '|' character and is separated by '|'.

| Sarah | 35 | Designer |
| Tom | 42 | Project Manager |
| Rachel | 26 | Data Analyst |

# The code snippet also includes formatting options to enhance the appearance of the table.
# For example, '# The following code snippet...' creates a header row that is bold and centered.
# The class modifier '.Name' adds a different background color to the column.
# The class modifier '.odd' adds a different background color to odd rows in the table.

Table: Description of Employees
|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation | 
|_.Name. |_. Age |_. Occupation |
|_.odd. John | 28 | Developer |
| Sarah | 35 | Designer |
|_.odd. Tom | 42 | Project Manager |
| Rachel | 26 | Data Analyst |

# The code snippet also allows for the use of tables within tables.
# This can be achieved by nesting tables in each cell of the main table.

|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation |
|_. Name |_. Age |_. Occupation |
| Sarah | 35 | Designer |
| John | 28 |
| Tom | 42 | Project Manager |

| Rachel | 26 | Data Analyst |

# The resulting output of this code snippet would be a complex table with four columns and five rows, including headers and data.
