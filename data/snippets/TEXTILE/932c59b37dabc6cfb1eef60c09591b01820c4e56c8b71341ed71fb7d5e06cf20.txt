h2. Basic Textile Syntax

p. Textile uses simple and intuitive syntax for formatting text. For example:

* _italic_ text is surrounded by underscores
* *bold* text is surrounded by asterisks
* +deleted+ text is surrounded by plus signs
* ??inserted?? text is surrounded by question marks

p. You can also add links, images, and more using additional symbols and formatting codes. For more information on the complete Textile syntax, check out the official documentation.

h2. Creating Lists

p. Textile supports both ordered and unordered lists, using similar syntax to HTML:

# First item in ordered list
# Second item in ordered list
# Third item in ordered list

* First item in unordered list
* Second item in unordered list
* Third item in unordered list

h2. Adding Tables

p. Tables can also be created in Textile using pipes and dashes to designate columns and rows:

|_. Column 1 |_. Column 2 |_. Column 3 |
| Row 1 | Row 1 Column 2 | Row 1 Column 3 |
| Row 2 | Row 2 Column 2 | Row 2 Column 3 |
| Row 3 | Row 3 Column 2 | Row 3 Column 3 |

h2. Advanced Textile Features
