//This snippet shows how to implement a sorting function using a custom comparator in APEX

//Define a public class named CustomComparator 
public class CustomComparator implements Comparable {

    //Define a method to compare two objects
    public Integer compareTo(Object obj){
    
        //Check if the passed in object is an instance of a custom object named CustomObject__c
        if(obj instanceOf CustomObject__c){
        
            //Type-cast the passed in object to CustomObject__c and store it in a variable
            CustomObject__c customObject = (CustomObject__c) obj;
            
            //Check if the custom object has a field called NumberField__c
            if(customObject.NumberField__c != null){
            
                //Compare the number field value of the current object to the number field value of the passed in object
                if(this.NumberField__c > customObject.NumberField__c){
                    return 1; //Return 1 if the current object's number field value is greater
                } else if(this.NumberField__c < customObject.NumberField__c){
                    return -1; //Return -1 if the passed in object's number field value is greater
                } else {
                    return 0; //Return 0 if both number field values are equal
                }
            } else {
                return 0; //Return 0 if the passed in object does not have a number field
            }
        } else {
            return 0; //Return 0 if the passed in object is not an instance of CustomObject__c
        }
    }
}

//Inside another class or trigger, create a list of CustomObject__c and add some records to it
List<CustomObject__c> customObjects = new List<CustomObject__c>();
customObjects.add(new CustomObject__c(NumberField__c = 5));
customObjects.add(new CustomObject__c(NumberField__c = 3));
customObjects.add(new CustomObject__c(NumberField__c = 8));
customObjects.add(new CustomObject__c(NumberField__c = 1));

//Create an instance of the CustomComparator class
CustomComparator comparator = new CustomComparator();

//Sort the list of custom objects using the custom comparator
customObjects.sort(comparator);
/* The list will now be sorted in ascending order by the NumberField__c value:
[1,3,5,8]
Note: This is just an example of how a custom comparator can be used. The logic and implementation may vary depending on the specific use case. */
