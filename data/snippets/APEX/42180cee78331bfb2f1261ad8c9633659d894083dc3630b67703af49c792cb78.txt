//This code snippet is an example of a class with multiple methods and variables in APEX.

//Create a public class called "Employee"
public class Employee {
    //Define private variables for employee name, age, and position
    private String name;
    private Integer age;
    private String position;

    //Create a constructor method to initialize the variables
    public Employee(String empName, Integer empAge, String empPosition) {
        name = empName;
        age = empAge;
        position = empPosition;
    }
    
    //Create a public method to retrieve the employee's name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    
    //Create a public method to retrieve the employee's age
    public Integer getAge() {
        return age;
    }
    
    //Create a public method to retrieve the employee's position
    public String getPosition() {
        return position;
    }
    
    //Create a public method to update the employee's position
    public void updatePosition(String newPosition) {
        position = newPosition;
    }
} 

//Create an instance of the Employee class called "employee1"
Employee employee1 = new Employee('John Smith', 35, 'Manager');

//Call the getName() method to retrieve the employee's name
employee1.getName();

//Call the getAge() method to retrieve the employee's age
employee1.getAge();

//Call the getPosition() method to retrieve the employee's position
employee1.getPosition();

//Call the updatePosition() method to update the employee's position to 'Senior Manager'
employee1.updatePosition('Senior Manager');
