// This is a complex code snippet in APEX - a development language for Salesforce
// It involves creating a custom object, defining fields and using conditional statements

// create a custom object named "Employee"
Object Employee = new Object("Employee"); 

// define custom fields for the Employee object
Employee.addField("Name", String);
Employee.addField("Position", String);
Employee.addField("Salary", Decimal);
Employee.addField("Department", Picklist);

// use a conditional statement to check if an employee's salary is greater than 50000
if(Employee.Salary > 50000) {
// if salary is greater than 50000, display message saying they are a senior employee
System.debug(Employee.Name + " is a senior employee.");
}
else {
// if salary is less than or equal to 50000, display message saying they are a junior employee
System.debug(Employee.Name + " is a junior employee.");
}

// create a new employee named John with a salary of $60000
Employee John = new Employee("John");
John.Salary = 60000;

// use a conditional statement to check if John is a senior or junior employee
if(John.Salary > 50000) {
System.debug("John is a senior employee.");
}
else {
System.debug("John is a junior employee.");
}
