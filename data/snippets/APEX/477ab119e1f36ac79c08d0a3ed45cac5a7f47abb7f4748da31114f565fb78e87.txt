// This is a complex APEX code snippet that calculates the total sales of a company
// based on data from multiple tables using SOQL queries and Apex classes

// First, we create a class called 'SalesCalculator' that will contain our code
public class SalesCalculator {
    
    // We define a variable that will hold the total sales amount
    public Decimal totalSales;
    
    // We use a constructor to initialize our variable and call our calculation method
    public SalesCalculator() {
        totalSales = 0;
        calculateTotalSales();
    }
    
    // This method will contain our calculations for the total sales
    public void calculateTotalSales() {
        
        // We create a list to hold the data from our SOQL queries
        List<Opportunity> opps = new List<Opportunity>();
        
        // We query for all opportunities with the 'Closed Won' stage
        opps = [SELECT Id, Amount FROM Opportunity WHERE StageName = 'Closed Won'];
        
        // We loop through the opportunities and add their amounts to our total sales
        for(Opportunity opp : opps) {
            totalSales += opp.Amount;
        }
        
        // We query for all closed won orders and add their amounts to our total sales
        List<Order> orders = [SELECT Id, TotalAmount FROM Order WHERE Status = 'Completed'];
        for(Order ord : orders) {
            totalSales += ord.TotalAmount;
        }
        
        // We query for all invoices related to closed won orders and add their amounts
        List<Invoice__c> invoices = [SELECT Id, Amount__c FROM Invoice__c WHERE Order__c IN :orders];
        for(Invoice__c inv : invoices) {
            totalSales += inv.Amount__c;
        }
        
        // Finally, we round the total sales to two decimal places
        totalSales = totalSales.setScale(2);
