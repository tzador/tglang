/**
 * This is a complex APEX code snippet that uses a for loop and if/else statements to calculate a mathematical series and print the results.
 *(Note: This is just an example of a complex code snippet and is not meant to be a functioning program.)
 *
 * @param num1  the starting number of the series (must be an integer)
 * @param num2  the number of times the series will be calculated (must be an integer)
 * @param multiplier  the value that will be multiplied by each number in the series (must be a decimal)
 * @return the array of results for each iteration of the series

// Output:
// Iteration 0 is divisible by 3
// Iteration 1 is not divisible by 3
// Iteration 2 is divisible by 3
// Iteration 3 is not divisible by 3
// Iteration 4 is not divisible by 3
// Iteration 5 is divisible by 3
// Iteration 6 is not divisible by 3
// Iteration 7 is not divisible by 3
// Iteration 8 is divisible by 3
// Iteration 9 is not divisible by 3
// Final results: [0, 7, 15, 24, 34, 45, 57, 70, 84, 99]
