/*
 This is a complex APEX code snippet that performs various operations on an account record.
 It first queries for an account with a specific account number, then updates its billing address,
 and finally checks if the account has any open opportunities.
 If there are open opportunities, it assigns them to a specific sales representative.

Account acc = [SELECT Name, BillingAddress FROM Account WHERE AccountNumber = '123456' LIMIT 1];

// Update billing address of account
acc.BillingAddress = '123 Main Street, San Francisco, CA 94102';

// Check if account has any open opportunities
if(acc.Opportunities != null && acc.Opportunities.size() > 0) {

    // Assign open opportunities to sales representative with ID 'ABCD123'
