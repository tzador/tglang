//This code snippet demonstrates how to perform a binary search in APEX

//Define a global variable for the array that will be searched
global Integer[] numArray = new Integer[]{5,10,15,20,25,30};

//Define a method for binary search that takes in a target value as parameter
global static Integer binarySearch(Integer target){

    //Initialize lower and upper variables to keep track of the indices
    Integer lower = 0;
    Integer upper = numArray.size() - 1;

    //Start a while-loop that will run as long as the lower index is less than or equal to the upper index
    while(lower <= upper){

        //Calculate the middle index by adding the lower and upper indices, then dividing by 2
        Integer mid = (lower + upper)/2;

        //Check if the target value is at the middle index
        if(target == numArray[mid]){
            //If it is, return the index
            return mid;
        }
        //If not, check if the target is less than the value at the middle index
        else if(target < numArray[mid]){
            //If it is, set the upper index to be one less than the current middle index
            upper = mid - 1;
        }
        //If the target is greater than the value at the middle index
        else{
            //Set the lower index to be one more than the current middle index
            lower = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    //If the target value is not found, return -1 to indicate it is not in the array
    return -1;
}

//Call the binarySearch method and pass in a target value of 25
Integer result = binarySearch(25);

//Print the result
System.debug('Target value 25 was found at index: ' + result);
