//An example of a complex Apex code with annotations

/*
The following code snippet creates a simple class called 'Employee' with properties and methods.
*/

//Class declaration
public class Employee {

    //Properties
    public String name; //Name of the employee
    public Integer age; //Age of the employee
    private Double salary; //Salary of the employee

    //Constructor
    public Employee(String employeeName, Integer employeeAge, Double employeeSalary) {
        this.name = employeeName;
        this.age = employeeAge;
        this.salary = employeeSalary;
    }

    //Method to calculate bonus based on employee age
    public Double calculateBonus() {
        Double bonus;
        if(this.age < 30) {
            bonus = 0.1 * this.salary; //10% bonus for employees under 30
        } else {
            bonus = 0.2 * this.salary; //20% bonus for employees 30 and over
        }
        return bonus;

    //Method to display employee information
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.debug('Employee Name: ' + this.name);
        System.debug('Employee Age: ' + this.age);
        System.debug('Employee Salary: $' + this.salary);
    }
}

//Creating an instance of the Employee class
Employee john = new Employee('John Smith', 28, 50000.00);

//Calling the displayInfo method on the john instance
john.displayInfo();

//Calling the calculateBonus method on the john instance and storing the result in a variable
Double johnBonus = john.calculateBonus();

//Output the bonus amount
System.debug('John\'s bonus is: $' + johnBonus);
