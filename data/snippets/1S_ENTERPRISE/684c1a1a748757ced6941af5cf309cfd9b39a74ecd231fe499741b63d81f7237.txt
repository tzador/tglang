// This code snippet will create a procedure that calculates the factorial of a given number
//First, declare the variables needed for the procedure
Var
    Number, Factorial : Integer;
    
//Next, create the procedure
Procedure CalculateFactorial(Number : Integer) Export
    Recursive
    // Check if number is equal to 1, if yes, then factorial is equal to 1
    If Number = 1 Then 
        Factorial = 1;
    Else 
        // If number is not equal to 1, then call the procedure recursively with (number-1)
        Factorial = Number * CalculateFactorial(Number - 1);
    EndIf;
EndProcedure

//Finally, call the procedure and pass in the number for which factorial needs to be calculated
CalculateFactorial(5);

//The output of this code snippet should be 120 (5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120)
