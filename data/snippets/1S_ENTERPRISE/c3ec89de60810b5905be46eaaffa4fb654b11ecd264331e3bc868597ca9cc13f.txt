//This comment is used to describe the purpose of the following code snippet.
//In 1C Enterprise language, variables are declared using the "Var" keyword.
Var
//In this example, we declare a variable "Number" of type "Number" with a precision of 10 digits
Number: Number (10);
//We also declare a variable "Text" of type "String" with a length of 50 characters
Text: String (50);
//Next, we assign a value of "5" to the "Number" variable
Number = 5;
//We can then use the "If" statement to check if the value of "Number" is greater than 0
If Number > 0 Then
//If the condition is met, the following code block will be executed
//We use the "Message" function to display the value of "Number" as a message box
    Message("Number is positive");
//We can also use "Else" to define what should happen if the condition is not met
Else
//In this case, we display a message stating that the number is negative
    Message("Number is negative");
//After the "If" statement, we can use the "While" loop to repeat a certain code block 
While Number > 0 Do
//In this example, we add 1 to the value of "Number" each time the loop is executed
    Number = Number + 1;
//We can use "EndDo" to signify the end of the "While" loop
EndDo
//Finally, we can use the "For" loop to repeat a code block for a specified number of times
//In this case, we use the "To" keyword to specify that the loop should run from 1 to 10
For I = 1 To 10 Do
//Inside the loop, we use the "Message" function to display the value of "I" as a message box
    Message(I);
//After the "For" loop, we use "EndDo" to signify the end of the loop
EndDo
