#This code snippet shows how to implement a recursive factorial function in 1C_ENTERPRISE

Function factorial(n)

    If n <= 1 Then
        Return 1;
    EndIf;

    Return n * factorial(n-1);

EndFunction

#To call the function, pass in the desired factorial number as the argument
#For example, to find the factorial of 5, the function call would look like: 
#factorial(5)
