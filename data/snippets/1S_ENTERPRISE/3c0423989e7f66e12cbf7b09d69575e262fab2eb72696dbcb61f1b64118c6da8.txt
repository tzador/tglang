// This program calculates the compound interest for a given principal and interest rate

// Declare variables for principal amount, interest rate, and number of years
Number principal = 1000.00;
Number interestRate = 0.05;
Number years = 10;

// Calculate compound interest using formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^nt
Number compoundInterest = principal * (1 + interestRate/12)^(12 * years);

// Print out the result
Print("The compound interest after 10 years is " + compoundInterest);

// Output: The compound interest after 10 years is 1647.01003831410
