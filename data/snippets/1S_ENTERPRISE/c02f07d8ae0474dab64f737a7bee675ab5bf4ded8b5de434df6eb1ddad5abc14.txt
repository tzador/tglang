#This code snippet is a function that calculates the average of a set of numbers
#The function takes in a generic data type 'Numbers' to allow for different types of numbers to be used
Function CalculateAverage(Numbers)

    #Declare a variable to store the sum of the numbers
    Var Sum = 0
    #Declare a variable to store the number of elements in the set
    Var N = 0

    #Loop through the Numbers set to calculate the sum and number of elements
    For Each Number In Numbers
        #Add the current number to the sum
        Sum = Sum + Number
        #Increment the number of elements by 1
        N = N + 1
    EndFor

    #Returns the average of the numbers by dividing the sum by the number of elements
    Return Sum / N
EndFunction

#Example usage of the function
#Create a set of numbers
Var Numbers = New Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

#Calculate the average of the numbers
Var Average = CalculateAverage(Numbers)

#Print the result
Message("The average is " + Average) #The output of this line will be "The average is 3", since (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3
