Function GetEmployeeSalary(employeeCode){
  //This function takes in an employee code and returns their monthly salary
  //and bonus as a string

  //Search for employee data in database
  //Assuming employee data is stored in a table called "employees"
  //and the salary and bonus columns are named "monthly_salary" and "bonus" respectively
  //using the FIND function which returns employee data based on a given condition
  :result = FIND("employees", "code", employeeCode);
  monthly_salary = :result.monthly_salary;
  bonus = :result.bonus;

  //Convert monthly salary and bonus to string
  salary_and_bonus = "Monthly Salary: " + STR(monthly_salary) + ", Bonus: " + STR(bonus);

  //Log employee's salary and bonus to console
  OUTP(salary_and_bonus);

  //Return the string containing salary and bonus
  RETURN salary_and_bonus;
}

//Call the function with a sample employee code
GetEmployeeSalary("EMP-12345");

//Output:
Monthly Salary: $5000, Bonus: $1000

//Sample result when employee code is not found in database:
"FIND" function returned "0", employee data not found in database
