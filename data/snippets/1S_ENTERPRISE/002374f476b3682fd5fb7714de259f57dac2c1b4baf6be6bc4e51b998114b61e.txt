// This is a function that calculates the price of a product based on its cost and markup percentage.
Function CalculatePrice(Price, Cost, Markup)
    // The function takes in three parameters - Price (the current price of the product), Cost (the cost of the product), and Markup (the desired markup percentage).
    // First, we need to calculate the markup amount by multiplying the cost by the markup percentage and dividing by 100.
    MarkupAmount = (Cost * Markup) / 100;
    
    // Next, we add the markup amount to the cost to get the new price.
    Price = Cost + MarkupAmount;
    
    // Finally, we round the price to two decimal places and return it.
    Return Round(Price, 2);
EndFunction

// Example usage
Price = 100; // Current price of the product
Cost = 50; // Cost of the product
Markup = 50; // Markup percentage
NewPrice = CalculatePrice(Price, Cost, Markup); // New price of the product after markup
