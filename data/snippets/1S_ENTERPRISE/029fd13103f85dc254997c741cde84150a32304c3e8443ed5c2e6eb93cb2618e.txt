#This code snippet is written in 1C_ENTERPRISE, a high-level, business-oriented programming language.
#It is typically used for developing business applications and automating processes within enterprises.

#The following code calculates the total sales for a specific period, using data from the company's sales database.

#First, we declare a variable to store the total sales amount.
Var TotalSales; 

#Next, we create a query to retrieve all sales data for the given period.
Query = New Query;
Query.Text = "SELECT Amount FROM Sales WHERE Date >= &PeriodStart AND Date <= &PeriodEnd";

#We then define the start and end dates for the period we want to calculate the total sales.
PeriodStart = Date(01,01,2020); #Start date of period
PeriodEnd = Date(12,31,2020); #End date of period

#Now we run the query and store the results in a selection object.
Selection = Query.Execute();

#Next, we loop through the selection object to calculate the total sales.
While Selection.Next() Do
    TotalSales += Selection.Amount;

#End the loop once all records have been processed.

#Finally, we output the total sales amount for the specified period.
Message("Total sales for period " + PeriodStart + " - " + PeriodEnd + " is " + TotalSales);
