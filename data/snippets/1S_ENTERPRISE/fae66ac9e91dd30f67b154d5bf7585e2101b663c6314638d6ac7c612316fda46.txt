// This code snippet creates a recursive function in 1C Enterprise to calculate the factorial of a given number

Function Factorial(Number)
    // Checks if the number is equal to 0 or 1, in which case the factorial is 1
    // Otherwise, it calls the function recursively with the number decremented by 1 and multiplies it by the number
    If Number = 0 Or Number = 1 Then
        Return 1
    Else
        Return Factorial(Number - 1) * Number
    EndIf
EndFunction

// Sets a variable to hold the given number
NumberToCalculate = 5

// Calls the Factorial function passing in the number to calculate
Result = Factorial(NumberToCalculate)

// Prints the result to the screen
MsgBox("The factorial of " + NumberToCalculate + " is " + Result)

// Expected output: The factorial of 5 is 120
