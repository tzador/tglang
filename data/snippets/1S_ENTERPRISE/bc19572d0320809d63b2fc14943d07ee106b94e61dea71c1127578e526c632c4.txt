Function CalculateTotalSalary(
    EmployeeList, // Input parameter: list of employees
    HourlyRate, // Input parameter: hourly rate
    HoursWorked // Input parameter: hours worked
) {

    TotalSalary = 0; // Initialize total salary variable

    For Each Employee in EmployeeList { // Loop through all employees in the list
        EmployeeSalary = HourlyRate * HoursWorked; // Calculate the employee's salary
