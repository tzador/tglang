# This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the total cost of a product in 1C Enterprise.

//Define constant variables for product price and quantity
constant ProductPrice = 10.50;
constant ProductQuantity = 5;

//Calculate the subtotal by multiplying the price and quantity
variable Subtotal = ProductPrice * ProductQuantity;

//Define function for calculating tax
function CalculateTax()
  variable Tax = Subtotal * 0.06; //Assuming a tax rate of 6%
  return Tax;
endFunction

//Define function for calculating total cost
function CalculateTotal()
  variable Total = Subtotal + CalculateTax();
  return Total;
endFunction

//Print the total cost with explanation
print("The total cost of the product is " + CalculateTotal() + " including 6% tax.");
