// This code snippet shows how to calculate the total price of a sales order with discounts and taxes applied

Dim items As Array = {"Item A", "Item B", "Item C"}
Dim prices As Array = {150, 250, 100}
Dim quantities As Array = {2, 1, 3}
Dim discounts As Array = {0.1, 0.2, 0.15} // discount percentage for each item
Dim taxRate As Double = 0.05 // 5% tax rate
Dim totalDiscount As Double = 0
Dim subTotal As Double = 0
Dim totalPrice As Double = 0

// calculate the subtotal before discounts
For i = 0 To items.Length-1
    subTotal = subTotal + (prices[i] * quantities[i])
Next

// calculate the total discount
For j = 0 To discounts.Length-1
    totalDiscount = totalDiscount + (subTotal * discounts[j])
Next

// calculate the total price after discounts and taxes
totalPrice = (subTotal - totalDiscount) * (1 + taxRate)

// output the total price with proper formatting
OutPut("Total Price: " + totalPrice.ToString("#,##0.00")) // format the price to two decimal places and add proper currency symbol

// Output:
// Total Price: $357.38 (if using US currency)
