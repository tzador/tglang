//This function converts a given integer value into binary and outputs a string representation
//of the binary number
Function ConvertToBinary(value) Returns String
  //define local variables
  Var binaryNum As String; //stores the binary number
  Var temp As Integer; //used for storing temporary values during conversion
  Var i As Integer; //counter variable for loop
  
  //loop until the value is greater than 0
  While value > 0 Do
    //perform division by 2 and save the remainder

//Example usage
Var number As Integer = 1234; //input value
Var binary As String; //stores the converted binary number
binary = ConvertToBinary(number); //call the ConvertToBinary function
OutPut(binary); //outputs the binary number in string format
