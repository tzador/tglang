#Code snippet for calculating the average salary of employees in a company
//Define a table for employee information
Personnel = New Table;
Personnel.Columns.Add("Name", Type("String"));
Personnel.Columns.Add("Department", Type("String"));
Personnel.Columns.Add("Salary", Type("Number"));

//Add data to the table
Personnel.AddRow("John Smith", "Sales", 5000);
Personnel.AddRow("Lisa Johnson", "Marketing", 6500);
Personnel.AddRow("Mark Davis", "HR", 4500);
Personnel.AddRow("Sarah Wilson", "Finance", 8000);
Personnel.AddRow("Kevin Brown", "Operations", 7000);

//Create a variable to store the total number of employees
totalEmployees = Personnel.Rows.Count();

//Create a variable to store the total salary of all employees
totalSalary = 0;

//Loop through the table to calculate the total salary
for i = 0 to totalEmployees - 1 do
	//Get the salary of each employee and add it to the total
	totalSalary = totalSalary + Personnel.GetCell(i, "Salary");
enddo

//Calculate the average salary by dividing the total salary by the number of employees
averageSalary = totalSalary / totalEmployees;

//Print the result
Print("The average salary of employees in the company is " + averageSalary + " dollars.");

//Output: 
The average salary of employees in the company is 6200 dollars.
