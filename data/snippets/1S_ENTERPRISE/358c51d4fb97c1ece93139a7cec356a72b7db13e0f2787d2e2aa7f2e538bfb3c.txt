//This code snippet calculates the average score of a student in a class
//Note: This code is just an example and may not be optimized for production use

//Define a class for student
Class Student
{
    Name : String; //variable to store student's name
    Scores : Array(Number); //array to store student's scores
    Average : Number; //variable to store student's average score
}

//Define a class for class
Class Class
{
    Students : Array(Student); //array to store all students in the class
}

//Define a procedure to calculate average score for a student
Procedure CalculateAverage(Student)
{
    //Initialize sum variable
    Sum = 0;

    //Loop through the student's scores and add them to sum
    For each Score in Student.Scores
    {
        Sum = Sum + Score;
    }

    //Calculate average by dividing sum by length of scores array
    Student.Average = Sum / Student.Scores.Length;
}

//Define a procedure to calculate average score for all students in a class
Procedure CalculateClassAverage(Class)
{
    //Initialize sum and count variables
    Sum = 0;
    Count = 0;

    //Loop through all students in the class
    For each Student in Class.Students

        CalculateAverage(Student);

        //Add student's average to sum
        Sum = Sum + Student.Average;

        //Increment count by 1
        Count = Count + 1;
    }

    //Calculate class average by dividing sum by count
    Class.Average = Sum / Count;
}

//Create an instance of Class
Class1 = New Class;

//Initialize students array with 3 students
Class1.Students = [
