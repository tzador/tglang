// This is a code snippet showcasing how to calculate the average value of an array in 1C Enterprise

// Define an array with integer values
Var arrayOfNumbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];

// Declare variables for holding the sum and average value
Var sum = 0, average = 0;

// Loop through the array and calculate the sum of all elements
For each number in arrayOfNumbers Do
    sum = sum + number;
EndDo;

// Calculate the average value by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
Average = sum / ArraySize(arrayOfNumbers);

// Output the result to the console
Message("The average value of the array is:" + average);
