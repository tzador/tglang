// This code snippet utilizes variables, loops, and conditionals to calculate and display the total cost of an order with discounts applied.
// It also uses functions to calculate discounted prices and a constant variable for the discount percentage.

// Set constant variable for discount percentage
#DEFINE DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE 0.1

// Set variable for total cost
Var TotalCost = 0;

// Set variable for number of items in order
Var NumOfItems = 5

// Create a function to calculate discounted price
Function CalculateDiscountPrice(Price) 
    Return Price - (Price * DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE) 
EndFunction 

// Create a loop to prompt user for input and calculate total cost
// Loop will run until all items have been accounted for
For i = 1 To NumOfItems
    // Prompt user for item price
    Print "Enter the price of item", i, ": "
    // Set variable for item price
    Var ItemPrice = Input();
    // Check if item price is greater than 0
    If(ItemPrice > 0) Then 
        // Calculate discounted price using function
        Var DiscountedPrice = CalculateDiscountPrice(ItemPrice);
        // Add discounted price to total cost
        TotalCost = TotalCost + DiscountedPrice;
    EndIf
EndFor 

// Display total cost to user
Print "Total cost with discount:", TotalCost;
