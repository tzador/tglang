//Code to calculate the average of a list of numbers
procedure Average(List, Result)
    List.Join(',') //Converts the list into a string separated by commas
    List.Explode(',') //Creates an array by splitting the string at commas

    //Loop through each element in the list and add them to a running total
    for i = 1 to List.Count() do
        Result += List.GetValue(i)

    //Divide the total by the number of elements to find the average
    Result /= List.Count()

    //Round the result to 2 decimal places for accuracy

//Example usage
List = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
Average(List, Result) //Result will equal 15

List2 = [14, 27, 32, 18]
Average(List2, Result) //Result will equal 22.75
