//This code snippet creates a function for calculating the average of an array of numbers.

Function CalculateAverage(Array)           //Declare the function with name and parameter
    Variable Sum;                           //Declare a variable to store the sum of numbers
    Variable Average;                       //Declare a variable to store the average
    Sum = 0;                                //Initialize the sum variable to zero

    For Each Element In Array               //Loop through each element in the array
        Sum = Sum + Element;                //Add the element to the sum variable
    EndDo

    Average = Sum / Array.Count;            //Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
    Return Average;                         //Return the average as the output of the function
EndFunction
