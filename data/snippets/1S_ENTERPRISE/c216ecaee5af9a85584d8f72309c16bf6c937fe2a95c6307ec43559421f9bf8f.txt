//This code snippet performs a highly complex calculation 
//using nested conditional statements and recursion

//First, define the function with two parameters,
//one for the values to be calculated and one for the number of iterations
Function CalculateValues(value, iterations)
    
    //Take the initial value and multiply it by 2 for each iteration
    If iterations = 0 Then
        Return value
    Else
        Return CalculateValues(value * 2, iterations - 1)
    EndIf
    
    //Add a conditional statement to perform a specific calculation
    //if the value is greater than 100
    If value > 100 Then
        new_value = value / 10
        
        //Execute a loop to perform additional calculations
        While new_value > 10 Do
            new_value = new_value / 2
            i = i + 1
        EndDo
        
        //Return the final calculated value
        Return new_value
    Else
        //If the value is not greater than 100, return the original value
        Return value
    EndIf
EndFunction

//Call the function with a starting value of 5 and 5 iterations
result = CalculateValues(5, 5)

//Print the result
