// This code snippet is written in 1C_ENTERPRISE

// In this example, we will create a class and use it to instantiate an object

// First, we define the class
Class Employee
{
    // Properties
    Property Name As String;
    Property Age As Integer;
    Property Position As String;

    // Constructor
    Procedure Employee(name, age, position)
    Name = name;
    Age = age;
    Position = position;
    EndProcedure

    // Methods
    Method IncreaseAge()
        Age = Age + 1;
    EndMethod

    Method ChangePosition(newPosition)
        Position = newPosition;
    EndMethod
}

// Now, we can instantiate an object of type Employee
Employee1 = New Employee("John", 25, "Manager");

// We can access and modify the properties of the object
Employee1.Age = 26;
Employee1.ChangePosition("Senior Manager");

// We can also call methods on the object
Employee1.IncreaseAge();

// Finally, we can output the information about the object
Message("Employee Name: " + Employee1.Name +
        "Employee Age: " + Employee1.Age.ToString() +
        "Employee Position: " + Employee1.Position);

// Output:
// Employee Name: John
// Employee Age: 26
// Employee Position: Senior Manager
