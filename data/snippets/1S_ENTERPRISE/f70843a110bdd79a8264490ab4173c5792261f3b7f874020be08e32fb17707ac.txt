# This code snippet is an example of a complex function in 1C_Enterprise.
# This function calculates the average of an array of numbers and returns the result.

FUNCTION CalculateAverage(numbers : Array) : Number
# This function takes in an array of numbers as a parameter.
	VAR result : Number;
# A variable called 'result' is declared to store the calculated average.
	result = 0;
# The variable 'result' is initialized with a value of 0.
	FOR element IN numbers DO
# A 'FOR' loop is used to iterate through each element in the 'numbers' array.
		result = result + element;
# In each iteration, the current element is added to the 'result' variable.
# After the loop finishes, 'result' will contain the sum of all the elements.
	result = result / numbers.Length();
# The sum is then divided by the length of the 'numbers' array to calculate the average.
	RETURN result;
# The calculated average is returned as the result of the function.
END FUNCTION
# The end of the function.
