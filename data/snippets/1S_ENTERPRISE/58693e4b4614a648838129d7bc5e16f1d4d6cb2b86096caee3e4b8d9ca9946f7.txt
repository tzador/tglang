// This 1C_ENTERPRISE code snippet is an example of a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number.
// In 1C_ENTERPRISE, recursive functions are defined by using the "&" sign before the function name.

RecursiveFunctionFactorial(Num) // function for calculating factorial
    Num = Num.Value; // convert argument to value
    If Num = 1 Then // check if Num is equal to 1
        Return 1; // if true, return 1 as the factorial of 1 is 1
    EndIf;
    Factorial = Num * RecursiveFunctionFactorial(Num - 1); // calculate factorial recursively, calling the same function with Num - 1 as the argument
    Return Factorial; // return the calculated factorial

// The following code snippet shows how to call the RecursiveFunctionFactorial above:

Num = 5; // set the number for which we want to calculate the factorial
Factorial = RecursiveFunctionFactorial(Num); // call the recursive function
Message("The factorial of " + Num + " is " + Factorial); // output the result to console
