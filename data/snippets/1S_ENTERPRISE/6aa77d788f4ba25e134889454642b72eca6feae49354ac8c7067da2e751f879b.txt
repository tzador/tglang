//This code snippet generates a random password with a length of 20 characters
//First, we define an array that contains all the characters we want to use in our password
chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+=-[]\{}|;':,./<>?~`"

//Next, we define a variable to store the randomly generated password
password = ""

//We use a for loop to generate the password of desired length
for i = 0 to 19 do
    //Inside the loop, we use the Random function to get a random index from the chars array
    //The value of the random index is then added to our password variable
    password = password + chars[Random(0, chars.Length - 1)]
enddo

//Finally, we print out the randomly generated password
Message(password)
