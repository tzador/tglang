# * This code snippet demonstrates the creation of a complex calculation formula in 1C_ENTERPRISE *
# * It calculates the total amount of a purchase, including taxes and discounts *
# * This snippet assumes that the purchase data is already entered into the system *

Calculate PurchaseAmount, PurchasePrice, Quantity, Tax, Discount; // Calculate the purchase amount by multiplying the purchase price by the quantity

Select TaxPercent; // Select the tax percentage to be applied to the purchase amount

If TaxPercent > 0 Then
    Tax = PurchaseAmount * (TaxPercent / 100); // Calculate the tax amount by multiplying the purchase amount by the tax percentage

// Check for any applicable discounts based on the purchase amount
If PurchaseAmount > 10000 Then
    Discount = PurchaseAmount * 0.05; // Apply a 5% discount if the purchase amount is greater than 10000
ElseIf PurchaseAmount > 5000 Then
    Discount = PurchaseAmount * 0.03; // Apply a 3% discount if the purchase amount is greater than 5000
Else
    Discount = PurchaseAmount * 0.01; // Apply a 1% discount for all other purchase amounts

FinalAmount = PurchaseAmount + Tax - Discount; // Calculate the final amount by adding the purchase amount and tax, and deducting the discount

// Output the final amount in a designated field
Assign ToField("FinalAmount", FinalAmount);
