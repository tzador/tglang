Function CalcEmployeeSalary(EmployeeID, HourlyWage, HoursWorked)
    // This function calculates the salary of an employee based on their ID, hourly wage and hours worked in a week.

    Salary = HourlyWage * HoursWorked // Calculate the salary by multiplying the hourly wage with the hours worked
    Bonus = Salary * 0.10 // Calculate the bonus by taking 10% of the calculated salary

    If EmployeeID = "0001" Then
        Salary = Salary + 5000 // Add 5000 to the employee's salary if their ID is "0001"
    ElseIf EmployeeID = "0002" Then
        Salary = Salary + 3000 // Add 3000 to the employee's salary if their ID is "0002"
    ElseIf EmployeeID = "0003" Then
        Salary = Salary + 2000 // Add 2000 to the employee's salary if their ID is "0003"
    EndIf

    If Salary > 100000 Then
        Bonus = Bonus + 5000 // Add 5000 to the employee's bonus if their salary is over 100000
    EndIf

    CalcEmployeeSalary = Salary + Bonus // Return the total calculated salary including the bonus
EndFunction

// Example usage:
Salary = CalcEmployeeSalary("0001", 50, 40) // Calculate the salary for employee with ID "0001", hourly wage of 50, and 40 hours worked
// Output: Salary = 7000 // The employee's total salary including the bonus of 5000
