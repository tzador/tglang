/* This code snippet demonstrates a complex mathematical calculation using variables and string concatenation 
in 1C_ENTERPRISE programming language */

// Define variables
Var x, y, z As Number;
Var result As String;

// Initialize variables with values
x = 10;
y = 5;
z = 2;

// Perform calculations
result = "The result of " + Str(x) + " multiplied by " + Str(y) + " and divided by " + Str(z) + " is " + Str(x * y / z) + ".";

// Output
MessageBox(result); /* This will display the result in a message box popup */

/* Output: 
The result of 10 multiplied by 5 and divided by 2 is 25.
