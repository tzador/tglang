//This code snippet is a 1C_ENTERPRISE program that calculates the factorial of a given number.

//Variable declarations
Variable number As Integer; //Stores the input number
Variable factorial As Integer; //Stores the calculated factorial
Variable index As Integer; //Used for loop iteration

//Input
number = 10; //Enter any number here

//Calculation
factorial = 1; //Set initial value for factorial
For index = 1 To number Do //Start of loop
	factorial = factorial * index; //Update factorial value by multiplying with current index value
EndDo; //End of loop

//Output
? "The factorial of " + number + " is " + factorial; //Prints the result with explanatory message
