//This code snippet is a complex example of a recursive function in 1C Enterprise language
//The function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion
Function CalculateFactorial(Number)
	//Checking if the number is equal to 1 or 0, in which case the factorial is simply 1
	If Number = 1 Or Number = 0 Then
		Return 1;
	EndIf

	//Calling the function recursively with a decremented number
	//For example, if the number is 5, the function will call itself with 4, then 3, then 2, then 1
	//Once the number reaches 1, the function will start returning and multiplying the values together
	//1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120, which is the factorial of 5
	Return Number * CalculateFactorial(Number - 1);
EndFunction

//Calling the function with a sample input of 5 and displaying the result
Message("Factorial of 5 is " + CalculateFactorial(5));
