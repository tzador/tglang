`//This code snippet demonstrates a sorting algorithm implementation in 1C_ENTERPRISE.

//Define an array containing unsorted numbers.
arrayOfNumbers = {5, 2, 7, 1, 3, 9, 4, 10, 6, 8};

//Define a variable to track the number of elements in the array.
numberOfElements = Length(arrayOfNumbers);

//Create a cycle that will iterate through the array.
For i = 0 To numberOfElements - 1 Do
Begin
	//Create a nested cycle to iterate through the remaining elements.
	For j = 0 To numberOfElements - i - 2 Do
	Begin
		//Compare the current element with the next element in the array.
		If arrayOfNumbers[j] > arrayOfNumbers[j+1] Then
		Begin
			//If the current element is larger, swap it with the next element.
			tempNumber = arrayOfNumbers[j];
			arrayOfNumbers = arrayOfNumbers[j+1];
			arrayOfNumbers[j+1] = tempNumber;
		End;
	End;
End;

//Output the sorted array.
