//This code snippet calculates the average of a given array of numbers
//Define the array
Array = [1, 5, 7, 9, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10];
//Define variable for sum of numbers
Sum = 0;
//Define variable for number of elements in array
ElementsCount = 0;
//Loop through the array and add each number to the sum variable
For Each (Number in Array) Do
    Sum = Sum + Number;
    //Increase element count by 1 for each number in array
    ElementsCount = ElementsCount + 1;
EndDo;
//Calculate and output average by dividing sum by number of elements
Avg = Sum / ElementsCount;
Message("The average of the array is " + Avg);
