#This code snippet is for adding two arrays in 1C_ENTERPRISE programming language

//Declare variables for the two arrays
Value1, Value2;

//Initialize the two arrays with sample values
Value1 = [5, 2, 8, 3];
Value2 = [1, 9, 4, 6];

//Declare an empty result array
Result = [];

//Loop through the values in the arrays and add them together
For i = 0 To 3 Do
    Result[i] = Value1[i] + Value2[i];
EndDo

//Output the result array
Result;
