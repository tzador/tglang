#This is a code snippet for a function that calculates the average age of a group of people

Function CalculateAverageAge(people)  #Function for calculating average age with a parameter of a list of people

    local ageSum = 0  #Initialize a variable to store the sum of ages of the people
    local numberOfPeople = people.Count()  #Get the number of people in the list

    #Loop through the list of people
    For i = 1 To numberOfPeople Step 1 #Using a for loop to iterate over the list
        ageSum = ageSum + people[i].Age  #Adding each person's age to the sum
    Next

    local averageAge = ageSum / numberOfPeople  #Calculate the average age by dividing the sum by the number of people

    #Return the average age
    Return averageAge
EndFunction

#To call the function, we can pass in a list of people
