// This code snippet is a basic example of a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers

// Define a function with the name "calculateAverage" that takes in a list of numbers as a parameter
// and returns the calculated average
Function calculateAverage(numbers)
	
	// Initialize a variable to store the total sum of the numbers
	Var totalSum = 0
	
	// Loop through the list of numbers
	For Each number In numbers Do
		// Add the current number to the total sum
		totalSum = totalSum + number
	EndDo
	
	// Calculate the average by dividing the total sum by the number of numbers in the list
	Var average = totalSum / numbers.Size()
	
	// Return the calculated average
	Return average

EndFunction
