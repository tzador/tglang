// This code snippet shows an example of a custom data type in 1C_ENTERPRISE

// Define the custom data type "Employee"
Type Employee
    // Declare attributes for the custom data type
    Name, // String type for employee's name
    Age, // Number type for employee's age
    Department, // String type for employee's department
    Salary; // Number type for employee's salary
