//This code snippet creates a method for calculating the average of a given array

//Define an array of integers
Dim MyArray As Array[Integer];

//Initialize the array with random values
MyArray = [5, 9, 13, 7, 1, 12, 15, 8];

//Define a method for calculating the average
Method CalculateAverage(Array As Array[Integer]) As Real
    //Declare and initialize variables
    Var Sum As Integer = 0;
    Var Count As Integer = 0;
    Var Average As Real = 0;
    
    //Loop through the array and calculate the sum
    For Each Element In Array Do
        Sum = Sum + Element;
        Count = Count + 1;
    EndDo;
    
    //Calculate the average
    Average = Sum / Count;
    
    //Return the average
    Return Average;
EndMethod;

//Call the method and store the result in a variable
Var MyAverage As Real = CalculateAverage(MyArray);

//Print the result
Message("The average is: " + Str(MyAverage));
