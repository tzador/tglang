#Function for calculating the factorial of a number using recursion in 1C_ENTERPRISE

#Creating a function that takes in a number as a parameter
Function CalculateFactorial(Number)
    
    #Checking if the number is equal to 1, which is the base case for the recursive function
    If Number = 1 Then
        
        #If the number is equal to 1, return 1 as the factorial
        Return 1
    EndIf
    
    #If the number is greater than 1, recursively call the function with the number minus 1
    Return CalculateFactorial(Number-1) * Number
EndFunction

#Calling the function and passing in the number for which the factorial needs to be calculated
CalculateFactorial(5) #This will output 120 (5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120)
