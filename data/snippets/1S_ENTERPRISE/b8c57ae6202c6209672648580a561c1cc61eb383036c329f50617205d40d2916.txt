// This code snippet is used to calculate the total sales of a company in a specific year.
// First, we define the variables needed for the calculation.
DateFrom = '01.01.2021';
DateTo = '31.12.2021';
Sales = 0;

// Next, we create a query to select all sales records within the specified date range.
Query = New Query;
Query.Text = "SELECT Sales FROM Sales WHERE Date >= &DateFrom AND Date <= &DateTo";

// Now, we execute the query and loop through the sales records to calculate the total sales.
Query.Execute();
While (Query.Next())

    Sales += Query.Result.Sales;
}

// Finally, we output the total sales amount for the specified year.
Result = "Total sales for " + DateFrom + " to " + DateTo + ": " + Sales;
