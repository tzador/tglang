//This code snippet creates a function called "add_numbers" that takes in two integers and returns their sum
Function add_numbers(param1, param2) Return Integer
    //Define two integer variables
    Var int1, int2 As Integer;
    //Assign values to the variables
    int1 = param1;
    int2 = param2;
    //Calculate and return the sum of the two integers
    Return int1 + int2;
EndFunction

//Calling the function
Message("The sum of 5 and 10 is " + add_numbers(5, 10)); //Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15
