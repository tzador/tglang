// This code snippet is an example of a complex sorting algorithm in 1C_ENTERPRISE programming language.
// It sorts an array of numbers in ascending order using the bubble sort method.

// Declare an array of 10 numbers to be sorted.
Dim array[10] As Integer;

// Fill the array with random numbers.
For i = 1 To 10 Do
	array[i] = Random(1, 100);
EndDo

// Print the unsorted array.
Output("Unsorted array: ");
For i = 1 To 10 Do
	Output(ToString(array[i]) + " ");
EndDo

// Declare a variable to keep track of changes made during sorting process.
Dim swapped As Boolean;

// Loop through the array until no more swaps are needed.
Do While swapped;
	swapped = False;

	// Loop through the array from the first to second last element.
	For i = 1 To 9 Do
		// Check if current element is greater than the next element.
		If array[i] > array[i+1] Then
			// Swap the elements.
			Dim temp As Integer = array[i];
			array[i] = array[i+1];
			array[i+1] = temp;

			// Set the swapped variable to true.
			swapped = True;
		EndIf
	EndDo
EndDo

// Print the sorted array.
Output("Sorted array: ");
For i = 1 To 10 Do
	Output(ToString(array[i]) + " ");
EndDo
