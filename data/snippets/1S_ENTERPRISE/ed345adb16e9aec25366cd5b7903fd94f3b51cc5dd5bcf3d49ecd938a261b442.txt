#This is a simple code snippet showing how to declare an array in 1C Enterprise programming language
Var
   MyArray; //the name of the array
   
Begin
   MyArray = New Array (3,3) //define the array with 3 columns and 3 rows
   
   //fill the array with values
   MyArray[0,0] = 1 //first element in first row and column
   MyArray[1,0] = 2 //second element in first row and column
   MyArray[2,0] = 3 //third element in first row and column
   MyArray[0,1] = 4 //first element in second row and column
   MyArray[1,1] = 5 //second element in second row and column
   MyArray[2,1] = 6 //third element in second row and column
   MyArray[0,2] = 7 //first element in third row and column
   MyArray[1,2] = 8 //second element in third row and column
   MyArray[2,2] = 9 //third element in third row and column
   
   //print the values of the array
   For i = 0 To 2 //loop through the rows
      For j = 0 To 2 //loop through the columns
         Message (MyArray[i,j]) //print the value at the current row and column
      EndDo;
   EndDo;
   
   //output:
   //1, 2, 3
   //4, 5, 6
   //7, 8, 9
