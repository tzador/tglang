// This code snippet shows how to calculate the sum of two numbers in 1C Enterprise language

// Declare two variables, with the first variable having a value of 10 and the second variable having a value of 20
Var
	num1: Integer = 10;
	num2: Integer = 20;

// Declare a third variable to store the sum of the first two numbers
Var
	sum: Integer;

// Calculate the sum of the two numbers using the "+" operator and store it in the "sum" variable
sum = num1 + num2;

// Display the sum on the screen using the "MessageBox" function
MessageBox("The sum of " + Str(num1) + " and " + Str(num2) + " is " + Str(sum));

// Output:
// The sum of 10 and 20 is 30
