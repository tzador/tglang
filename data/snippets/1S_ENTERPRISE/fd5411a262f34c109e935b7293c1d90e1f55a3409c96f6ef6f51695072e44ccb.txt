// This code snippet defines a function that iterates through a list of employees and calculates their salaries based on their roles and experience levels

// Function name: calculateSalary

// Input parameters:
// - employees: list of employee objects with the following attributes: name, role, years of experience

// Output: total salary for all employees

Function calculateSalary(employees) {

  // Define a variable for storing the total salary
  var totalSalary = 0;

  // Iterate through the list of employees
  for(var i = 0; i < employees.length; i++) {

    // Calculate the base salary based on the employee's role
    var baseSalary = 0;
    if(employees[i].role == "manager") {
      baseSalary = 5000;
    } else if(employees[i].role == "developer") {
      baseSalary = 4000;
    } else if(employees[i].role == "business analyst") {
      baseSalary = 3500;
    } else if(employees[i].role == "designer") {
      baseSalary = 3000;
    }

    // Calculate the experience bonus based on the employee's years of experience
    var experienceBonus = employees[i].yearsOfExperience * 100;

    // Add the base salary and experience bonus to the total salary
    totalSalary += baseSalary + experienceBonus;
  }

  // Return the total salary
  return totalSalary;
}

// Example usage:

// Define a list of employee objects
var employees = [
  {name: "John", role: "manager", yearsOfExperience: 10},
  {name: "Mary", role: "developer", yearsOfExperience: 5},
  {name: "Bob", role: "business analyst", yearsOfExperience: 3},
  {name: "Emily", role: "designer", yearsOfExperience: 8}
]

// Call the calculateSalary function with the list of employees as the input
// Output: 39000 (5000 + 10 * 100 + 4000 + 5 * 100 + 3500 + 3 * 100 + 3000 + 8 * 100)
