/*This code snippet is a simple program that calculates the average of an array of numbers */
/*Initialize the array with the numbers */
ArrayOfNumbers = [10, 25, 15, 32, 50];

/*Initialize the sum variable to store the sum of all the numbers in the array */
Sum = 0;

/*Initialize the count variable to store the number of elements in the array */
Count = 0;

/*Using a cycle, go through each element in the array and add it to the sum variable */
For Each number In ArrayOfNumbers Do
  Sum = Sum + number;
  Count = Count + 1;
EndDo;

/*Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements */
Average = Sum / Count;

/*Output the result to the user */
