// This code snippet takes a list of employees and calculates their total salary by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours worked.

// Creating a list of employee objects
var employees = [
    {
        name: "John Doe",
        hourlyRate: 25,
        hoursWorked: 40
    },
    {
        name: "Jane Smith",
        hourlyRate: 27.5,
        hoursWorked: 35
    },
    {
        name: "Mike Johnson",
        hourlyRate: 30,
        hoursWorked: 45
    }
];

// Defining a function to calculate employee's total salary
function calculateSalary(employee) {
    var totalSalary = employee.hourlyRate * employee.hoursWorked;
    return totalSalary;
}

// Using the map function to apply the calculateSalary function to each employee in the list and storing the results in a new array
var salaries = employees.map(calculateSalary);

// Using the reduce function to sum up all the salaries in the new array and getting the total salary for all employees
var totalSalary = salaries.reduce(function(acc, curr) {
    return acc + curr;
}, 0);

// Printing the total salary
console.log("Total Salary: " + totalSalary);

/* Output:
Total Salary: 4675
