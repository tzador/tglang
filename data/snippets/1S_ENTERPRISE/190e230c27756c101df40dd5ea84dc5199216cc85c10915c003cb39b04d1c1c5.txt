// This is a program that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
// Comment: This program is written in 1C_ENTERPRISE version 8.3

// Comment: Function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
    
Function Factorial(Number)
  // Comment: Base case, if number is 0, then factorial is 1
  If Number = 0 Then
    Return 1;
  EndIf
  
  // Comment: Recursive case, calls function to calculate factorial of Number-1 and multiplies it by Number
  Return Factorial(Number-1) * Number;
EndFunction

// Comment: Main function that prompts the user for a number and calls the Factorial function on it
Procedure Main()
  // Comment: Prompt the user for a number and store it in a variable
  Input Number;
  
  // Comment: Call the Factorial function on the number and assign the result to a variable
  Result = Factorial(Number);
  
  // Comment: Print out the result
  Write("The factorial of " + Number + " is " + Result);
  
  // Comment: Optional pause to let the user see the result before exiting the program
  Wait("Press any key to exit");
EndProcedure

// Comment: Call the main function to start the program
Call Main();
