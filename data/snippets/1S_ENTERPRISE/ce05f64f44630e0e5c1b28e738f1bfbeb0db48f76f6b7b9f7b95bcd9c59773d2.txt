#Annotated markdown snippet

// This code snippet is written in the 1C_ENTERPRISE programming language
// It contains a complex function that calculates the average of two numbers, along with various string manipulations

// Declare variables
Var
  firstNumber, secondNumber, averageNumber Number;
  firstName, lastName String;
  fullNameString, reversedFullNameString String;
  
// Get user input for numbers
firstNumber = Input();
secondNumber = Input();

// Perform calculations and store result in averageNumber variable
averageNumber = (firstNumber + secondNumber) / 2;

// Get user input for first and last name
firstName = Input();
lastName = Input();

// Concatenate first and last name into a single string
fullNameString = firstName + " " + lastName;

// Reverse the order of the characters in the full name string
reversedFullNameString = StrRev(fullNameString);

// Output the average of the two numbers, along with the full name and reversed full name strings
OutPut("The average of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is " + averageNumber);
OutPut("Your full name is " + fullNameString);
OutPut("Your name in reverse is " + reversedFullNameString);
