// This code snippet creates a custom class with properties, methods, and events in 1C_Enterprise language

// Defining the class
Class MyClass
    Property Name As String; // Property to store the name of the class
    Property Age As Integer; // Property to store the age of the class
    Property Address As String = "Unknown"; // Property with default value

    // Constructor method to initialize the class with name and age
    Constructor(Name, Age)
        Me.Name = Name;
        Me.Age = Age;

    // Method to say hello to the class
    Method SayHello()
        Message("Hello, my name is " + Me.Name + " and I am " + IntToStr(Me.Age) + " years old.");

    // Event when class is initialized
    EventHandler ClassInit() 
        Message("Class initialized.");

    // Event when property Name is changed
    EventHandler NameChanged(NewValue)
        Message("Name changed to " + NewValue + ".");

// Creating an instance of the class
MyClass myObject = New MyClass("John", 25);

// Changing the value of Name property
myObject.Name = "Jane";
