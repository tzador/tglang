//This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion

//Create a procedure named "factorial" with a parameter "n"
Procedure factorial(n) Return v as Integer

//Declare a local variable "result" and initialize it to 1
result = 1;

//Check if the value of "n" parameter is equal to 0
If (n = 0) Then

//If "n" is equal to 0, return "result" which is equal to 1
Return result;

//If "n" is not equal to 0, call the "factorial" procedure recursively
Else
Return n * factorial(n - 1);

//End the "factorial" procedure
End Procedure

//Declare a variable "input" and prompt the user to enter a number for factorial calculation
input = InputBox("Enter a number:");

//Convert the input from string to integer since the "factorial" procedure expects an integer parameter
num = ToInt(input);

//Call the "factorial" procedure and store the result in a variable "output"
output = factorial(num);

//Print the result to the console
Message("The factorial of " + Str(num) + " is " + Str(output));

//Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
