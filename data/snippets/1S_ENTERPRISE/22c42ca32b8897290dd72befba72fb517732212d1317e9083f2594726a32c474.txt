//This code snippet shows a function that calculates the area of a triangle

Function CalculateTriangleArea (Side1, Side2, Side3)
//Declaring function with three parameters representing the sides of the triangle

   If (Side1 <= 0 or Side2 <=0 or Side3 <=0) Then
   //Checking if the input values are non-positive, which is not valid in a triangle
      Return 0;
      //Returning 0 as the area cannot be calculated

   EndIf

   //Using the Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle
   //Heron's formula: Area = âˆš(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) where s is the semi-perimeter and a, b, c are the sides
   s = (Side1 + Side2 + Side3)/2;
   Area = sqrt(s*(s-Side1)*(s-Side2)*(s-Side3));

   Return Area;
   //Returning the calculated area of the triangle

EndFunction
//End of function CalculateTriangleArea
