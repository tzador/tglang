//This is a complex code snippet in 1C Enterprise language
//It includes variables, loops, and conditional statements

//First, we define a variable for our company's monthly budget
Var MonthlyBudget As Number;

//Next, we prompt the user to enter the actual monthly budget
Input "Enter the actual monthly budget:" To MonthlyBudget;

//Then, we create a variable for the total expenses
Var TotalExpenses As Number;

//We use a loop to prompt the user to enter each expense, and add it to the total expenses
For Var i = 1 To 12 Do
  //We use a conditional statement to make sure the input is a valid number
  If i = 1 Then
    Input "Enter expense for January:" To TotalExpenses;
  ElseIf i = 2 Then
    Input "Enter expense for February:" To TotalExpenses;
  ElseIf i = 3 Then
    Input "Enter expense for March:" To TotalExpenses;
  ElseIf i = 4 Then
    Input "Enter expense for April:" To TotalExpenses;
  ElseIf i = 5 Then
    Input "Enter expense for May:" To TotalExpenses;
  ElseIf i = 6 Then
    Input "Enter expense for June:" To TotalExpenses;
  ElseIf i = 7 Then
    Input "Enter expense for July:" To TotalExpenses;
  ElseIf i = 8 Then
    Input "Enter expense for August:" To TotalExpenses;
  ElseIf i = 9 Then
    Input "Enter expense for September:" To TotalExpenses;
  ElseIf i = 10 Then
    Input "Enter expense for October:" To TotalExpenses;
  ElseIf i = 11 Then
    Input "Enter expense for November:" To TotalExpenses;
  ElseIf i = 12 Then
    Input "Enter expense for December:" To TotalExpenses;
  EndIf;
EndDo;

//Next, we calculate the difference between the monthly budget and total expenses
Var Difference As Number;
Difference = MonthlyBudget - TotalExpenses;

//Then, we display the result to the user
Message "The difference between the monthly budget and total expenses is " + Difference + " rubles.";

//Lastly, we use a conditional statement to check if the budget was under or over budget and display a message accordingly
If Difference < 0 Then
  Message "Unfortunately, we have exceeded our monthly budget.";
ElseIf Difference > 0 Then
  Message "Congratulations, we have stayed under our monthly budget.";
Else
  Message "We have exactly met our monthly budget.";
EndIf;
