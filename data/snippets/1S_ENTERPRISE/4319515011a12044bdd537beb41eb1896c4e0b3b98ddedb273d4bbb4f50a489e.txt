// First, we define a procedure called 'CalcFibonacci' with a single input parameter 'n'
Procedure CalcFibonacci(n)

	// We declare two variables 'a' and 'b' and initialize them to 0 and 1 respectively
	Var a, b;
	a = 0;
	b = 1;

	// Now we perform a loop from 2 to 'n'
	For i = 2 To n
		// We use the variables 'a' and 'b' to calculate the next number in the Fibonacci sequence
		// and store it in variable 'c'
		c = a + b;
		// Here we shift the values of 'a' and 'b' to the next two numbers in the sequence
		a = b;
		b = c;
	EndDo;

	// Finally, we output the value of 'c' which is the 'n'th number in the Fibonacci sequence
	Output c;

// End of procedure 'CalcFibonacci'

// Now we call the procedure with a user defined value of 'n' and store the result in a variable 'result'
result = CalcFibonacci(10);

// We output the result to the screen
Message("The 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence is " + result); 

// Output: The 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 55
