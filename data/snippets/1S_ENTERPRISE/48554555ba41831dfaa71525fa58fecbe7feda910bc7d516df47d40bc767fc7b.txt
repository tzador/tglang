// This code snippet is a sample function in 1C_ENTERPRISE programming language

// Define a function named "calculate_bonus" that takes in two parameters: "salary" and "years_worked"
Procedure calculate_bonus(salary, years_worked)
{
    // Define a local variable named "bonus_amount"
    Variable bonus_amount; 

    // If the employee has been working for less than 5 years
    If years_worked < 5 Then
    {
        // Calculate the bonus amount as 10% of the salary
        bonus_amount = salary * 0.1;
    }
    // If the employee has been working for 5 to 10 years
    Elif years_worked >= 5 AND years_worked <= 10 Then
    {
        // Calculate the bonus amount as 15% of the salary
        bonus_amount = salary * 0.15;
    }
    // If the employee has been working for more than 10 years
    Else
    {
        // Calculate the bonus amount as 20% of the salary
        bonus_amount = salary * 0.2;
    }

    // Print out the bonus amount with a message
    Message("The bonus amount is " + bonus_amount + " for " + years_worked + " years worked.");
}

// Call the function with a salary of $50,000 and 8 years worked
calculate_bonus(50000, 8); 

// Output:
// The bonus amount is 7500 for 8 years worked.
