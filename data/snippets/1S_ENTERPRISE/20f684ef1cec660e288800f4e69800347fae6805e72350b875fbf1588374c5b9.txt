//This code snippet demonstrates how to create a nested function in 1C Enterprise.

//Declare the external function
Void CreateEmployee(FirstName, LastName, Department)

    //Declare the internal function
    Function SetEmployeeInfo(FirstName, LastName)
        //Set the first name and last name of the employee
        Employee.FirstName = FirstName;
        Employee.LastName = LastName;
    EndFunction

    //Set the department of the employee
    Employee.Department = Department;

    //Call the internal function to set the employee info
    SetEmployeeInfo(FirstName, LastName);
   
    //Save the employee in the database
    Employee.Save();
    
EndFunction

//Call the external function with the following parameters
CreateEmployee('John', 'Smith', 'Finance');
