#Code for finding the average temperature of a city

Function CalculateAverageTemperature (CityID, StartDate, EndDate)
	//Function for calculating average temperature of a city between a given time period
	Parameters:
	CityID - ID number of the city 
	StartDate - Start date of the time period (in format DD.MM.YYYY)
	EndDate - End date of the time period (in format DD.MM.YYYY)
	
	Variables:
	CurrentDate - Current date while looping through the given time period (in format DD.MM.YYYY)
	SumOfTemperatures - Sum of all temperatures recorded during the given time period
	TemperatureCount - Number of temperatures recorded during the given time period
	AverageTemperature - Average temperature of the city between the given time period
	
	Begin
	
	//Initializing variables
	CurrentDate := StartDate;
	SumOfTemperatures := 0;
	TemperatureCount := 0;
	
	While CurrentDate <= EndDate Do
		
		//Querying database for temperature recorded on current date in the given city
		RetrieveTemperature (CityID, CurrentDate);
		
		//If temperature data exists, add it to the sum
		If Temperature <> Null Then
			SumOfTemperatures := SumOfTemperatures + Temperature;
			TemperatureCount := TemperatureCount + 1;
		
		//Incrementing current date by 1 day
		CurrentDate := CurrentDate + 1;
	#EndWhile
	
	//Calculating average temperature using the formula
	AverageTemperature := SumOfTemperatures / TemperatureCount;
