// This program calculates the factorial of a number

Procedure CalculateFactorial(Number)
  
  // Declare variable to store the factorial value
  Factorial = 1

  // Loop through all the numbers from 1 to the input number
  For i = 1 To Number Do
  
    // Multiply the current number with the factorial value
    Factorial = Factorial * i
  
  EndDo
  
  // Output the factorial value
  Message("Factorial of " + Number + " is " + Factorial)

EndProcedure

// Call the CalculateFactorial procedure for a given input number
