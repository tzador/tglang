#Description - This code snippet demonstrates a complex conditional statement with nested if/else statements and a while loop.

//Initializing variables for comparison
Var num1 = 5;
Var num2 = 10;
Var num3 = 15;

//Beginning of conditional statement
If num1 > num2 Then
    //Prints the value of num3 if num1 is greater than num2
    Message("num1 is greater than num2 and num3 is " + num3);
Else
    //Prints the sum of num1 and num2 if num1 is not greater than num2
    Message("num1 is not greater than num2 and the sum of num1 and num2 is " + (num1+num2));

//Beginning of nested if/else statement
If num1 < num2 Then
    //Prints the difference between num2 and num3
    Message("num2 is greater than num1 and the difference between num2 and num3 is " + (num2-num3));
Else
    //Prints the product of num1 and num3
    Message("num2 is not greater than num1 and the product of num1 and num3 is " + (num1*num3));

//Beginning of while loop
While num3 > 0 Do
    //Prints the value of num3 and then decreases it by 1 until it reaches 0
    Message("num3 is currently " + num3);
    num3 = num3 - 1;
EndDo;
