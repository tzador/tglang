/**
 * This code snippet is an example of creating a complex query in 1C Enterprise language. It uses multiple tables and joins to retrieve data based on various conditions.
 */

// Define selection to retrieve data from the main table
Query = New Query;
Query.Text = "SELECT
    ProductCode,
    ProductName
FROM
    Catalog.Products
WHERE
    DeletionMark = False
";

// Add joins to retrieve data from other tables and connect them to the main selection
Join1 = Query.AddJoin("Catalog.PriceTypes", "PriceTypeCode", "PriceTypeId");
Join1.Condition = "AND PriceTypeCode = 'Retail'";
Join2 = Query.AddJoin("Catalog.ProductPrices", "ProductId", "Id");
Join2.Condition = "AND ProductPrices.PriceTypeId = PriceTypes.Id
    AND ProductPrices.CatalogCode = Products.Id
    AND ProductPrices.Markup > 0";

// Define filters to further refine the selection
Filter = Query.AddFilter("ProductPrices.Markup > 50 OR ProductPrices.Price > 100");

// Execute the query and retrieve the resulting data
Result = Query.Execute().Unload();

// Loop through the data and output it to the user
For Each Row In Result Do
    Message(Concat("Product code ", Row.ProductCode, " has a markup of ", Row.ProductPrices.Markup));
    Message(Concat("The price for this product is ", Row.ProductPrices.Price));
EndDo;

// Output example:
/*
    Product code ABC123 has a markup of 60
    The price for this product is 120
    Product code XYZ789 has a markup of 55
    The price for this product is 110
