// This code snippet calculates the total cost of a customer's order.

// Define variables:
// Order pricing data
PriceList = New Structure("ProductID", "Price", "Quantity")
PriceList.Insert(123, 10.99, 2) // First product ordered with ID 123, price of 10.99, and quantity of 2
PriceList.Insert(456, 5.49, 3)  // Second product ordered with ID 456, price of 5.49, and quantity of 3
PriceList.Insert(789, 8.75, 1)  // Third product ordered with ID 789, price of 8.75, and quantity of 1

// Additional order data
Customer = "John Smith"  // Name of the customer placing the order
Shipping = 5.00  // Cost of shipping for the order
Discount = 0.10  // Discount percentage applied to the order

// Calculate total cost of order
Total = 0
For Each Product In PriceList  // Loop through each product in the order
    Total = Total + (Product.Price * Product.Quantity)  // Add product price multiplied by quantity to total cost
EndDo
Total = Total + Shipping  // Add shipping cost to total
If Discount > 0 Then  // Check if discount is greater than 0
    Total = Total - (Total * Discount)  // Apply discount to total cost
EndIf

// Output results
Message("Customer: " + Customer)
Message("Total Cost: " + Total)

// Output:
