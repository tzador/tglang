# This is an example of a quadratic equation solver
# This program takes in three integers (a, b, and c) and returns the two solutions for x

# Define the function for solving quadratic equations
function solveQuadratic(a, b, c)
    # Calculate the discriminant
    discriminant = b^2 - 4*a*c
    
    # Check if the discriminant is negative, which means no real solutions exist
    if discriminant < 0
        # Print an error message and exit the function
        println("No real solutions exist for this equation.")
        return
    end
    
    # Calculate the two possible solutions for x
    solution1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant))/(2*a)
    solution2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant))/(2*a)
    
    # Print the solutions
    println("The two solutions for x are:")
    println("x = $solution1")
    println("x = $solution2")
end

# Call the function with example values
solveQuadratic(2, -5, 3)

# Output:
# The two solutions for x are:
# x = 3.0
# x = 0.5
