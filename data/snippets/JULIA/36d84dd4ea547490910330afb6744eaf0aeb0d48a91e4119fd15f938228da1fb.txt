# This code snippet is for calculating the value of Pi using the Leibniz formula

# Define a function to calculate the value of Pi
function calculate_pi(n)
    
    # Initialize variables
    pi_value = 0.0
    denominator = 1.0
    
    # Loop through n terms of the formula
    for i in 0:n-1
        # Calculate the current term using the Leibniz formula
        term = 4.0 / denominator
        
        # Alternate the sign of the term
        if iseven(i) 
            term = -term 
        end
        
        # Add the current term to the pi value
        pi_value += term
        
        # Increase the denominator for the next term
        denominator += 2.0
    end
    
    # Return the calculated pi value
    return pi_value
end

# Call the function with a large number of terms (to increase accuracy)
pi = calculate_pi(1000000)

# Print the calculated value of Pi
println("The value of Pi is: ", pi)
