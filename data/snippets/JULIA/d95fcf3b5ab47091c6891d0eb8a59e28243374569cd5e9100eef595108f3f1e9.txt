# This code snippet calculates the mean of a list of numbers
# Define a function called "mean" that takes in a list "numbers" as an argument
function mean(numbers)
    total = 0 # Initialize variable "total" to keep track of sum of numbers
    # Use a for loop to iterate through the list and update the total
    for i in 1:length(numbers)
        total += numbers[i]
    end
    # Calculate the mean by dividing the total by the number of elements in the list
    mean = total/length(numbers)
    return mean # Output the mean 
end

# Define a list of numbers to test the function with
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Call the function and store the result in a variable called "result"
result = mean(numbers)

# Print the result
println(result)
