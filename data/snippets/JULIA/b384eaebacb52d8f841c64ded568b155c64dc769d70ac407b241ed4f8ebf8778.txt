# Define a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
function factorial(n)
    # Initialize a variable to store the factorial value
    fact = 1
    # Use a for loop to iterate through values from 1 to n
    for i in 1:n
        # Multiply the current value with the factorial variable
        fact = fact * i
    end
    # Return the factorial value
    return fact

# Call the factorial function to calculate the factorial of 5
