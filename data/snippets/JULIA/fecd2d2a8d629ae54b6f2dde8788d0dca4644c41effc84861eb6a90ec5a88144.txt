# Define a function named 'mean_of_squares' that takes in two arguments: 'x' and 'y'
function mean_of_squares(x, y)
    # Create a variable named 'sum' and assign it the value of x squared plus y squared
    sum = x^2 + y^2
    # Create a variable named 'mean' and assign it the value of the sum variable divided by 2
    mean = sum / 2
    # Return the mean variable
    return mean
end

# Create an array named 'numbers' with the values 5, 8, and 12
numbers = [5, 8, 12]

# Create a variable named 'result' and assign it the value of the mean_of_squares function with the arguments
# of the first and third elements of the numbers array
result = mean_of_squares(numbers[1], numbers[3])

# Print the result to the console
print(result)

# Output: `45.5`
