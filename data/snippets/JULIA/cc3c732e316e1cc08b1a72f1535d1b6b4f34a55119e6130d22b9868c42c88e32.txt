#= This is a function in Julia that calculates the average value of a list of numbers =#
function average(list::Array{Int64,1})
    
    #= Initializing a variable "sum" to store the sum of all numbers in the list =#
    sum = 0
    
    #= Looping through each element in the list and adding it to "sum" =#
    for i in 1:length(list)
        sum += list[i]
    end
    
    #= Calculating the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list =#
    avg = sum / length(list)
    
    #= Returning the average value =#
    return avg
end

#= Example usage of the function =#
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average(nums) # Output: 3.0
