# This is a bank account class in Julia programming language
# with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance
# and attributes for account number, customer name, and current balance

# Define a BankAccount class
struct BankAccount
    account_number::String
    customer_name::String
    balance::Float64
end

# Implement deposit method
function deposit(account, amount)
    account.balance += amount

end

# Implement withdraw method
function withdraw(account, amount)
    if account.balance < amount
        println("Insufficient funds. Cannot withdraw $amount from account $account.account_number.")
    else
        account.balance -= amount
        println("Successfully withdrew $amount from account $account.account_number.")
    end
end

# Implement check_balance method
function check_balance(account)
    println("Current balance for account $account.account_number owned by $account.customer_name is $account.balance.")
end

# Create a new BankAccount instance with initial values
account1 = BankAccount("123456789", "John Smith", 1000.00)

# Deposit 500 into account1
deposit(account1, 500.00)

# Withdraw 200 from account1
withdraw(account1, 200.00)

# Check balance for account1
check_balance(account1)
