# Create a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
function factorial(n)
    if n <= 1 # if statement to handle base case when n is 0 or 1
        return 1
    else
        return n * factorial(n-1) # recursively call function with n-1 until n is reduced to 0 or 1
    end
end

# Test the function with input of 5
factorial(5) #=> 120
