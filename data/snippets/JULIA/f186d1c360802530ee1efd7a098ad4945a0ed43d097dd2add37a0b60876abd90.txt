function binary_search(arr, x)
    # This function implements the binary search algorithm to find the index of a given item in a sorted array
    # Input: arr - the array to search in
    # x - the item to search for
    # Output: the index of the searched item if found, else -1
    
    low = 1 # initialize the first index of the array
    high = length(arr) # initialize the last index of the array
    
    while low <= high # while there are still elements to search in
        mid = Int(floor((low + high) / 2)) # calculate the middle index
        if arr[mid] == x # if the middle element is the searched item
            return mid # return the index
        elseif arr[mid] < x # if the middle element is smaller than the searched item
            low = mid + 1 # update the lower bound to be the next index after the middle
        else # if the middle element is larger than the searched item
            high = mid - 1 # update the higher bound to be the index before the middle
        end
    end
    
    return -1 # if the item is not found, return -1
end

# Example of using the function
array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
item = 11
result = binary_search(array, item)
println("Index of $item is $result") # prints "Index of 11 is 6"
