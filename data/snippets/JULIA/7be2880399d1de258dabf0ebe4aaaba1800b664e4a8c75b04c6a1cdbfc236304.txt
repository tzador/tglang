# Define function to calculate nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
function fib(n)
    # Create an array to store initial terms
    arr = [0,1]
   
    # Use for loop to calculate and add new terms
    for i in 3:n
        # Calculate the next term by summing previous two terms
        next_term = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2]
      
        # Add new term to array
        push!(arr, next_term)
    end

# Call the function with input n = 10 and store the result in a variable
result = fib(10)

# Print the result
println(result)

# Output: 34 (The 10th term in the Fibonacci sequence)
