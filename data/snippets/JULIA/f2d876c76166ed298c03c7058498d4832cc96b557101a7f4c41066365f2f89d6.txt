# This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up
# to the specified limit and prints the results.

# Function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence
function fib(n)

    # Initialize first two terms of sequence
    f = [0, 1]

    # Use a for loop to calculate the rest of the sequence
    for i = 3:n
        # Push the next term to the sequence
        push!(f, f[i-1] + f[i-2])
    end

    # Return the full sequence
    return f
end

# Call the function with a limit of 10
fib(10)

# Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
