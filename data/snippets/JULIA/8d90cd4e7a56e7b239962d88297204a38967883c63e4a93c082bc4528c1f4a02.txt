# This code snippet uses Julia programming language
# It creates a function to calculate the sum of squares of a list of numbers

# Create a function called sum_squares with one input parameter 'nums'
function sum_squares(nums)
    # Initialize a variable 'sum' with value 0 to store the total sum
    sum = 0
    # Use a for loop to iterate through each element in 'nums'
    for num in nums:
        # Calculate the square of current number and add it to the total sum
        sum += num^2
    end
    # Return the total sum as the output of the function
    return sum
end

# Create a list of numbers to test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Call the function sum_squares with input parameter as the list of numbers
# Store the returned output in a variable 'result'
result = sum_squares(numbers)

# Print the result to the console
# The output should be 55 as the sum of squares of numbers 1 to 5 is 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 55
println(result)
# Output: 55
