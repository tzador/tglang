# This function calculates the factorial of a given number recursively.
# It first checks if the number is less than 1, if so, it returns 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1.
# If the number is greater than 1, it calls the function recursively with n-1 as the parameter and multiplies it with n, until n reaches 1.
