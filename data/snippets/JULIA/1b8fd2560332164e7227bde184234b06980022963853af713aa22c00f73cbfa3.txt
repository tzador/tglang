### Creating a function that calculates the average value of a list of numbers ###
 
function calc_average(numbers::Array{Float64,1})
  sum = 0.0                        #initialize a variable to store the sum of the numbers
  for num in numbers               #iterate through the numbers in the list
    sum += num                     #add each number to the sum variable
  end
  avg = sum / length(numbers)      #calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list
  return avg                       #return the average value
end
 
numbers = [2,4,6,8,10]             #initialize a list of numbers
avg = calc_average(numbers)        #call the function to calculate the average
println("The average value is: ", avg)   #print the average value to the console
