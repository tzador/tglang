# Define a function to calculate the integral of a given polynomial expression
function integrate(polynomial)
    # Initialize sum variable
    sum = 0
    # Create anonymous function to calculate the polynomial value at a given point
    polynomial_func = x -> polyval(polynomial, x)
    # Calculate the integral using the trapezoidal rule
    for i in 1:length(polynomial) - 1
        # Calculate the width of each trapezoid
        h = polynomial[i + 1] - polynomial[i]
        # Calculate the average of the polynomial values at the two ends of the trapezoid
        avg_val = (polynomial_func(i) + polynomial_func(i + 1)) / 2
        # Calculate the area of the trapezoid and add it to the sum variable
        sum += h * avg_val
    end
    # Return the final calculated integral
    return sum
end

# Example usage
# Define a polynomial with coefficients [1, 2, 3]
p = [1, 2, 3]
# Calculate the integral of the polynomial from 0 to 5
integrate(p)(0, 5)
