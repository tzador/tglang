# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

function factorial(n)       # Function to calculate factorial, takes in a number n
    if n == 0               # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
        return 1               
    else                    # Recursive case: factorial of n is n * factorial of n-1
        return n * factorial(n-1)
    end
end

n = 5                       # Input to calculate factorial of
println(factorial(n))       # Print the factorial of n

# Output: 120
