# This is a complex code snippet written in the programming language Julia.
# Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language designed for numerical computing and scientific computing.
# The code below is an implementation of a function called `quicksort` for sorting a array using the quicksort algorithm.

# Function to partition the array and select a pivot
function partition(arr, low, high)
        # Choosing the pivot element as the last element of the array
        pivot = arr[high]
        # Initializing the variable to track the index of smaller elements
        i = low - 1
        
        # Loop through the array, compare each element to the pivot, and swap if necessary
        for j = low:high-1
            # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot, increment the index of smaller elements
            if arr[j] â‰¤ pivot
                i += 1
                # Swap elements at index i and j
                temp = arr[i]
                arr[i] = arr[j]
                arr[j] = temp
            end
        end
        
        # Swap the pivot element with the element at index i+1
        temp = arr[i+1]
        arr[i+1] = arr[high]
        arr[high] = temp
        
        # Return the index of the pivot element
        return i+1
end

# Function to perform the quicksort algorithm on the given array
function quicksort(arr, low, high)
        # Check if the array contains more than one element
        if low < high
            # Partition the array and get the index of the pivot element
            pivot_index = partition(arr, low, high)
            
            # Recursively call quicksort on the subarrays (left of pivot and right of pivot)
            quicksort(arr, low, pivot_index-1)
            quicksort(arr, pivot_index+1, high)
        end
end

# Example code to test the quicksort function

# Creating an array with random integers between 1 and 100
arr = rand(1:100, 10)

# Printing the unsorted array
println("Unsorted array: ", arr)

# Sorting the array using quicksort algorithm
quicksort(arr, 1, length(arr))

# Printing the sorted array
println("Sorted array: ", arr)

# Output: 
# Unsorted array: [59, 80, 27, 44, 74, 22, 57, 4, 58, 1]
# Sorted array: [1, 4, 22, 27, 44, 57, 58, 59, 74, 80]
