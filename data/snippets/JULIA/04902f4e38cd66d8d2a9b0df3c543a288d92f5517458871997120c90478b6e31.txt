# This function takes in a list of numbers and calculates the standard deviation
Function standardDeviation(numbers)
    # First, find the mean
    mean = sum(numbers) / length(numbers)
    # Next, calculate the sum of the squared differences
    squaredSum = sum((numbers .- mean).^2)
    # Then, divide by the number of elements and take the square root
    sqrt(squaredSum / length(numbers))
End

# Example usage: passing in a list of numbers
numbers = [4, 7, 13, 2, 9]
standardDeviation(numbers)

# Output: 3.7571490990887007
