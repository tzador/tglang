"""
The following code creates a class called `Person` with two properties: `name` and `age`.
It also has two methods: `greet` and `celebrate_birthday`.
`greet` takes in a `Person` object and returns a personalized greeting message.
`celebrate_birthday` takes in a `Person` object and increments their age by 1.
"""

# Define the `Person` class
struct Person
    name::String
    age::Int64
end

# Define the `greet` method
function greet(person::Person)
    return "Hello, $(person.name)! Nice to meet you."
end

# Define the `celebrate_birthday` method
function celebrate_birthday(person::Person)
    person.age += 1
    return "Happy $(person.age)th birthday, $(person.name)!"
end

# Create a new `Person` object
person = Person("Jane Doe", 25)

# Call the `greet` method
greet(person)

# Output: Hello, Jane Doe! Nice to meet you.

# Call the `celebrate_birthday` method
celebrate_birthday(person)

# Output: Happy 26th birthday, Jane Doe!
