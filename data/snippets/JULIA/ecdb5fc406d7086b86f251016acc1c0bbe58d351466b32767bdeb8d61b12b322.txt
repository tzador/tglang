# This code snippet calculates the area of a circle given its radius

# Define a function called calculate_area that takes in one argument, radius
function calculate_area(radius)
    # Raise radius to the power of 2 and multiply by pi to get the area
    area = pi * radius^2
    return area # Return the calculated area
end

# Call the function and store the result in a variable called circle_area
circle_area = calculate_area(5)

# Print the result to the console
println("The area of the circle is: ", circle_area)
