# This code snippet calculates the average of a list of numbers using a for loop
function average(numbers::Array{Float64, 1})
    # Initialize variables
    sum = 0
    count = 0

    # Loop through each element in the list
    for number in numbers 
        # Add current element to sum
        sum += number
        # Increment count by 1
        count += 1
    end
    
    # Calculate and return average
    return sum / count
end

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [25.5, 17.3, 9.8, 13.2, 32.1]

# Call the average function and print the result
println("The average of the list is: ", average(numbers))
