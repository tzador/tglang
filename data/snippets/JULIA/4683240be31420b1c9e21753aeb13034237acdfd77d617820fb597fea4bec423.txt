# This is a code snippet that implements a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number in Julia.
# The function takes in one argument, the number for which factorial is to be calculated.
# It returns the factorial value.

function factorial(n)
    # Base case
    if n == 0
        return 1
    end

    # Recursive call
    return n * factorial(n-1)
end

# Main function to take user input and call the factorial function
function main()
    # Prompt for user input
    print("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: ")

    # Convert user input to integer
    n = parse(Int64, readline())

    # Call factorial function
    result = factorial(n)

    # Print result
    print("The factorial of ", n, " is ", result)
end

# Call main function to start program
main()

# Example output:
# Enter a number to calculate its factorial: 6
# The factorial of 6 is 720
