# This function calculates the factorial of a given number
function factorial(n)
    # Declare a variable to store the factorial, initialize with 1
    fact = 1
    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in 1:n
        # Multiply the current factorial value by the current number
        fact = fact * i
    end
    # Return the final factorial value
    return fact
end
# Calculate the factorial of 5 and print the result
println(factorial(5))
# Output: 120 (5! = 120)
