function newtons_method(f, x0, ϵ)
    # This function implements Newton's method for finding roots of a given function.
    # Params:
    # - f: function that takes in a number and returns a number
    # - x0: initial guess for root
    # - ϵ: tolerance level for convergence
    # Returns:
    # - x: approximated root of the function
    x = x0   # initialize x
    dx = Inf # initialize dx
    while abs(dx) > ϵ
        # calculate the slope at x with a small change in x
        df = (f(x + ϵ) - f(x)) / ϵ
        # calculate dx using the slope at x and the value of the function at x
        dx = - f(x) / df
        # update x by subtracting dx from current value of x
        x -= dx
    end
    return x
end

# Example usage of the newtons_method function
f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 1     # define the function to find roots of
root = newtons_method(f, 2.0, 0.0001)     # find the root of f near x = 2 with tolerance level of 0.0001
println("Root of the function is: ", root) # print out the root
