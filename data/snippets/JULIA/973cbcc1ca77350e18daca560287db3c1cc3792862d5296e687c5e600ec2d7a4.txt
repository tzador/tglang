# Define a function that calculates the sum of squares of a list of numbers 
# and squares each element individually before calculating the sum

function sum_of_squares(list_of_numbers) 
    # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of squares
    total = 0 
    
    # Loop through each element in the list
    for number in list_of_numbers 
        
        # Square the element
        number = number^2 
        
        # Add the squared element to the total
        total += number 
    end 
    
    # Return the total
    return total 
end 

# Create a list of numbers to test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

# Call the function and store the result
result = sum_of_squares(numbers) 

# Print the result
println(result) 

# Output:
# 55
