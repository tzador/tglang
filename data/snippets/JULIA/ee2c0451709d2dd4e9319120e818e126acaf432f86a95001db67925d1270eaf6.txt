#This is a function that checks if a number is prime or not
##Parameters: n - integer
##Returns: true if n is prime, false if n is composite
function isprime(n)
    if n < 2 #checks if number is less than 2, as all numbers less than 2 are not prime
        return false
    end
    if n == 2 #2 is the only even prime number, so we check if the number is 2
        return true
    end
    if n % 2 == 0 #if number is even, it is not prime
        return false
    end
    for i in 3:2:int(floor(sqrt(n))) #checks all odd numbers up to the square root of n
        if n % i == 0 #if n is divisible by any of these odd numbers, it is not prime
            return false
        end
    end
    return true #if none of the above conditions are satisfied, the number is prime
