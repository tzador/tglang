# This code snippet uses the Fibonacci function to generate a sequence of numbers

# Define the function with one argument, n
function fibonacci(n)
    # Initialize an empty array to store the sequence
    sequence = []

    # Use a for loop to iterate through each number in the sequence
    for i in 1:n
        # If i is the first or second number in the sequence, add it to the array
        if i <= 2
            push!(sequence, i)
        # If i is not the first or second number, calculate it using the previous two numbers in the sequence
        else
            push!(sequence, sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])
        end
    end
    
    # Return the completed sequence
    return sequence
end

# Call the function with an input of 10 and store the result in the variable 'fib'
fib = fibonacci(10)

# Print the result
println(fib)
