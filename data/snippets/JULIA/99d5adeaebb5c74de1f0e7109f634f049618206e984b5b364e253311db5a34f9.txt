# This is a code snippet that uses Julia's built-in functions to generate a list of random numbers, sort them and then calculate their mean, median and mode.

# Generate a random list of integers between 1 and 50 with a length of 10.
list = rand(1:50, 10)

# Sort the list in ascending order.
sorted_list = sort(list)

# Calculate the mean of the list.
mean_of_list = mean(list)

# Calculate the median of the list.
median_of_list = median(list)

# Calculate the mode of the list.
mode_of_list = mode(list)

# Print out the results.
println("Original List: ", list)
println("Sorted List: ", sorted_list)
println("Mean of List: ", mean_of_list)
println("Median of List: ", median_of_list)
println("Mode of List: ", mode_of_list)
