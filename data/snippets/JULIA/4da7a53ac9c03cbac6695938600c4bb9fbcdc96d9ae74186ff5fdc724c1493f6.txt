#Defines a function named "is_prime" that takes in a single argument (n)
function is_prime(n)
    #If n is less than 2, it is not a prime number, so return false
    if n < 2

    for i in 2:isqrt(n)

    end
    #If n is not divisible by any numbers in the range, it is a prime number, so return true
