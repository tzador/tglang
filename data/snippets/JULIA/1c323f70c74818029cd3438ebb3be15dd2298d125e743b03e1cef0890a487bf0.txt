# define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
function factorial(n)
    # initialize a variable to store the factorial
    fact = 1

    # loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in 1:n
        # multiply the current number with the stored factorial
        fact *= i
    end

    # return the factorial
    return fact
end

# call the function with a number to calculate its factorial
factorial(5)

# output: 120
