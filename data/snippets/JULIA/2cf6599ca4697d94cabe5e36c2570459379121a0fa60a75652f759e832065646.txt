# This code snippet implements a function that calculates the sum of first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence
function fibonacci(n)
    # Initialize an array to store the sequence
    sequence = [0, 1]

    # Loop through the sequence, starting from the third term
    for i in 3:n
        # Calculate the next term by adding the two previous terms
        next = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]

        # Append the next term to the sequence
        push!(sequence, next)
    end

    # Return the sum of the first n terms of the sequence
    return sum(sequence[1:n])
end
