# Define a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
function fibonacci(n)
    # Use a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to n
    for i in 1:n
        # For the first two numbers, set the value of f to i
        if i <= 2
            f = i
        # For numbers greater than 2, use the previous two values of f to calculate the next value
        else
            f = previous_f + current_f
        end
        # Set the previous and current values of f for the next iteration
        previous_f = current_f
        current_f = f
    end
    # Return the final fibonacci number
    return f
end

# Call the function and pass in 10 as the argument
fibonacci(10)

# Output: 55
