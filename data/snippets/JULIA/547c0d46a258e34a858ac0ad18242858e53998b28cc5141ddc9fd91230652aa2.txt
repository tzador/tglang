# Import the necessary packages
using LinearAlgebra

# Define the matrix A
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]

# Calculate the LU decomposition of A
luA = lu(A)

# Obtain the L matrix from the decomposition
L = luA.L

# Obtain the U matrix from the decomposition
U = luA.U

# Calculate the product of the diagonal elements of U
determinant = prod(diag(U))

# Print the result
println(determinant)

# Output:
