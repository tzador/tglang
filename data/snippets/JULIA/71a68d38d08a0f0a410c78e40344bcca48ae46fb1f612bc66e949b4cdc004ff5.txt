#= This is a function that takes in two arguments: a matrix and a vector =#

function matrix_vector_multiply(A, b)
    m = size(A, 1) #=  This line gets the number of rows in the matrix =#
    n = size(A, 2) #=  This line gets the number of columns in the matrix =#

    #= The following condition checks if the number of columns in the matrix is equal to the length of the vector =#
    if n != length(b)
        return "Error: Matrix and vector dimensions do not match."
    end

    #= This is where we initialize the output vector =#
    c = zeros(m)

    #= We loop through each row of the matrix =#
    for i in 1:m
        #= We set the initial value of the dot product to 0 =#
        dot_prod = 0
        #= We loop through each column of the matrix =#
        for j in 1:n
            #= We calculate the dot product by multiplying the corresponding elements of the row and the vector =#
            dot_prod += A[i,j] * b[j]
        end
        #= We assign the dot product as the value of the corresponding element in the output vector =#
        c[i] = dot_prod
    end

    #= Finally, we return the output vector =#
    return c
end

#= Let's test our function by multiplying a 3x3 matrix by a 3-element vector =#
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
b = [10, 11, 12]
matrix_vector_multiply(A, b) # Output: [68.0, 167.0, 266.0] =#
