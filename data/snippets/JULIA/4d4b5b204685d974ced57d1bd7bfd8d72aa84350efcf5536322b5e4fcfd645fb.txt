# Define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

function factorial(num)
    # Initalize result as 1
    result = 1

    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to num
    for i in 1:num
        # Update the result by multiplying it with current number
        result = result * i
    end

    # Return the final result
    return result
end

# Call the factorial function with input 5 and print the output
println(factorial(5))

# Output: 
# 120
