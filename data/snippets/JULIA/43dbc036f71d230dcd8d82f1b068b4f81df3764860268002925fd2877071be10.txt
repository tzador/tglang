# Define a function called "find_square" that takes in an integer as an argument
function find_square(x::Int)
    # Initialize a variable "result" with a value of 0
    result = 0 
    # Iterate through numbers from 1 to the input integer
    for i in 1:x 
        # Add the current number to the square of "result"
        result += i ^ 2 
    end 
    # Return the final value of "result"
    return result 
end

# Call the function with input of 5 and print the result
println(find_square(5))

# Output:
# 55
