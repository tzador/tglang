# Define a function that takes in two arrays and returns
# the dot product of the two arrays.
function dot_product(arr1, arr2)
    # Initialize a variable to store the final result.
    result = 0
    
    # Loop through the arrays and calculate the dot product.
    for i in 1:length(arr1)

        result += arr1[i] * arr2[i]

# Create two sample arrays.
array1 = [2, 5, 3]

# Call the function and store the result in a variable.

# Print the result.
println("The dot product of array1 and array2 is: ", product)

# Output:
The dot product of array1 and array2 is: 31
