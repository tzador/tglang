## Defining a function to calculate the factorial of a number

function factorial(n)
    if n == 0 # if n is equal to 0, return 1
        return 1
    elseif n < 0 # if n is less than 0, return NaN
        return NaN
    else
        result = 1 # initialize result variable
        while n > 1 # while n is greater than 1, multiply result by n and decrease n
            result *= n
            n -= 1
        end
        return result
    end
end

## Calling the function to calculate the factorial of 6 and storing the result in a variable

factorial_6 = factorial(6)

## Printing the result

println("Factorial of 6 is ", factorial_6)
