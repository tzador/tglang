# Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
function factorial(n)
    
    # Use a for loop to iterate through all numbers from n down to 2
    for i in n:-1:2
        n *= i-1 # Use the shorthand form of multiplication and assignment
        
    end # End the for loop
    
    return n # Return the final value of n, which will be the factorial of the original number
end # End the function definition
