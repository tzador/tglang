#= This is a code snippet written in Julia language
The code below calculates the square root of a number using the
Newton's method.

# Define the function for Newton's method
function newton(x)
    xc = x
    while (xc - x/xc) > epsilon * x
        xc = (xc + x/xc) / 2
    end
    return xc
end

# Set the value of the number to find square root of
a = 576

# Set the desired precision
epsilon = 1e-6

# Call the newton function and print the result
println("The square root of $a is: ", newton(a))
