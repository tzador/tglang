### Define a function to calculate the mean of a given vector of numbers
function mean(vector) # Function keyword followed by function name and argument definition in parentheses
    sum = 0 # Initialize a variable to store the sum of the numbers
    for num in vector # Iterate through each element in the vector
        sum += num # Add the current number to the sum variable
    end
    return sum / length(vector) # Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the total number of elements in the vector
end # End of the function

# Create a vector of numbers
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Call the mean function and store the result in a variable
mean_value = mean(numbers)

# Print the result
println(mean_value) # Should output 6.0
