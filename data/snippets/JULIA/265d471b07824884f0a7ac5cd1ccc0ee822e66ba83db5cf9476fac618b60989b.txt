'''
This code snippet uses the Julia programming language to calculate the sum of the first n prime numbers.

# Define a function to check if a number is prime
function is_prime(n)
    for i in 2:isqrt(n) # loop through numbers from 2 to square root of n
        if n % i == 0    # if n is divisible by any number from 2 to square root of n, return false
            return false
        end
    end
    return true          # if n is not divisible by any number from 2 to square root of n, return true
end

# Define a function to generate the first n prime numbers
function generate_primes(n)
    primes = [2]         # initialize an array with 2 as the first prime number
    num = 3              # start with the next odd number
    while length(primes) < n # loop until the number of primes is equal to n
        if is_prime(num)     # if num is prime, add it to the list of primes
            push!(primes, num)
        end
        num += 2         # always increment by 2 to skip even numbers
    end
    return primes       # return the list of primes
end

# Call the function to generate the first 10 prime numbers
generate_primes(10)    # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
