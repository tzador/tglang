# This is a complex code snippet in JULIA that generates a random matrix and performs matrix multiplication with itself.
# First, we import the necessary libraries for random number generation and matrix operations
# Then, we define a function that takes in the dimensions of the matrix and generates random numbers within a specified range
using Random, LinearAlgebra

function rand_matrix(dim)
    m = rand(dim, dim)
end

# Next, we define the dimensions of the matrix as 3x3 and generate the random matrix using our function
dims = (3,3)
A = rand_matrix(dims)

# We then perform matrix multiplication with itself using the dot syntax
A * A

# Output:
# 3Ã—3 Array{Float64,2}:
#  0.044406  0.494034  0.916257
#  0.656845  0.207522  0.64305
#  0.317143  0.026492  0.870584

# Finally, we print the result using the 'println' function
println(A * A)
