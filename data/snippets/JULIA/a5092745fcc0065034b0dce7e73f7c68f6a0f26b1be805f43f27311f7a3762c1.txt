# Define a function named `calculate_hypotenuse` that takes in two parameters `a` and `b`
function calculate_hypotenuse(a, b)
    # Calculate the squared value of `a` and `b` and save them in variables
    a_squared = a^2
    b_squared = b^2
    # Add the squared values together and take the square root
    c = sqrt(a_squared + b_squared)
    # Return the calculated value of `c`
    return c
end
# Call the function and pass in the values 3 and 4 as arguments
