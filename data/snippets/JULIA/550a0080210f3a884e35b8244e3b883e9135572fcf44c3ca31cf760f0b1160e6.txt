# Define a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to n
# Inputs:
#   n: the number of terms in the sequence
function fibonacci(n::Int)
    # Initialize an array to store the sequence
    sequence = zeros(Int, n)
    
    # Set the first two terms of the sequence to 0 and 1
    sequence[1] = 0
    sequence[2] = 1
    
    # Loop through the remaining terms and calculate the sequence
    for i in 3:n
        sequence[i] = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]
    end
    
    # Return the calculated sequence
    return sequence
end

# Call the function and pass in 10 as the input value
# The output should be [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
fibonacci(10)

# Output
# [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
