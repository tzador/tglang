# Define a function named "power" that takes in two arguments, "base" and "exponent"
function power(base, exponent)
    # Create a variable "result" and initialize it to 1
    result = 1
    
    # Create a for loop that iterates from 1 to the value of "exponent"
    for i in 1:exponent
        # Update the value of "result" by multiplying it with the "base"
        result = result * base
    end
    
    # Return the final value of "result"
    return result
end

# Call the "power" function with "base = 2" and "exponent = 5"
power(2, 5)

# OUTPUT: 32
