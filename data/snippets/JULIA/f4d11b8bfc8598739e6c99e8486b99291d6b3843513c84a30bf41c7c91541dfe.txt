# Define a function called "factorial" that takes in an integer argument "n"
# and returns the factorial of n
function factorial(n::Int64)
    # Check if n is 0, if so return 1
    if n == 0
        return 1
    end
    # Create a variable "product" to store the factorial result
    product = 1
    # Loop from 1 to n and multiply each number to product
    for i = 1:n
        product *= i
    end
    # Return the final product
    return product
end

# Call the "factorial" function and pass in argument 5
factorial(5) # Output: 120
