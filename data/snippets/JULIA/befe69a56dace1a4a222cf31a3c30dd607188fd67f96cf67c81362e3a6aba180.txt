# Define a function that checks if a number is prime or not
function isPrime(num)
    # Initialize a variable to store the result
    prime = true

    # Check if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and its square root
    for i in 2:sqrt(num)
        if num % i == 0
            # If it is divisible, set the result variable to false
            prime = false
            # Break out of the loop
            break
        end
    end

    # Print the result
    prime ? println("The number is prime") : println("The number is not prime")
end

# Call the function with a random number
isPrime(13)

# Output: The number is prime
