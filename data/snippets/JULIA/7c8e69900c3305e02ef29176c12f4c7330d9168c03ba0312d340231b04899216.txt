### Function to generate random matrix ###
function random_matrix(dim)
# Parameters:
#   - dim: tuple with dimensions of matrix
# Output:
#   - Matrix with random values between 0 and 1
    matrix = zeros(dim) # initialize matrix with all zeros
    for i in 1:dim[1]
        for j in 1:dim[2]
            matrix[i,j] = rand() # assign random value between 0 and 1 to each element
        end
    end
    return matrix
end

# Example usage
dimension = (3,5)
random_matrix(dimension) # creates a 3x5 matrix with random values between 0 and 1
