# Define a function called "fibonacci" that takes in an integer "n" as its parameter
function fibonacci(n)
    # Create a variable "sequence" to store the fibonacci sequence
    sequence = [0, 1]

    # Create a for loop to iterate through "n" numbers
    for i in 3:n
        # Append the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence to the sequence list
        # and store it in a variable "next_number"
        next_number = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]
        push!(sequence, next_number)
    end

    # Return the last number in the sequence

# Print the result of calling the fibonacci function with the argument "10"
