This is a code snippet in Julia that demonstrates how to calculate the factorial of a number using a for loop.
The snippet takes in a number 'n' from the user and calculates the factorial of that number.
=#

# Define a function to calculate the factorial
function factorial(n)

    # Initialize the result to 1
    result = 1

    # Loop through all the numbers from 1 to n
    for i = 1:n
        # Multiply result with current number
        result *= i
    end
    # Return the final result
    return result
end

# Ask the user to input a number
println("Enter a number:")
n = parse(Int64, readline())

# Call the factorial function with the user input
fact = factorial(n)

# Display the result
println("The factorial of $n is $fact")
