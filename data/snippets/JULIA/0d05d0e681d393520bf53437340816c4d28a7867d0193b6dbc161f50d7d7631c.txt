# Define a Julia function that finds the greatest common divisor of two integers
function gcd(a,b)
    # Initializing variables
    r = 0
    d = 0
    c = 0
    
    # Finding the remainder
    r = a%b
    
    # Checking if remainder is 0, if yes, return b as the gcd
    if r == 0
        return b
    end
    
    # If the remainder is not 0, recursively call the function with swapped values
    c = gcd(b,r)
    return c
end

# Call the function and print the output
println("The greatest common divisor of 12 and 18 is ", gcd(12, 18))

# Output:
# The greatest common divisor of 12 and 18 is 6
