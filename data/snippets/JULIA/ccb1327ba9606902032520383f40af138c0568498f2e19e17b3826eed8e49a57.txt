# This code snippet demonstrates a complex algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm

# Define a function that takes in a graph, a start node, and an end node
function dijkstra(graph, start_node, end_node)
    # Create a dictionary to keep track of the shortest distances between nodes
    distances = Dict()
    # Set the distance of the start node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity (or a very large number)
    distances[start_node] = 0
    for node in keys(graph)
        if node != start_node
            distances[node] = Inf
        end
    end

    # Create a dictionary to keep track of the previous node in the shortest path
    previous = Dict()
    # Set the previous node of the start node to none
    previous[start_node] = none

    # Create a priority queue to keep track of the nodes to be visited
    queue = PriorityQueue{Tuple{Int64, Symbol}}()
    # Add the start node with a priority of 0 to the queue
    enqueue!(queue, (0, start_node))

    # Loop while the queue is not empty
    while !isempty(queue)
        # Get the node with the lowest priority (i.e. shortest distance) from the queue
        current_node = dequeue!(queue)

        # If the current node is the end node, break out of the loop
        if current_node == end_node
            break
        end

        # Loop through all the neighbors of the current node
        for neighbor in keys(graph[current_node])
            # Calculate the distance from the start node to the current node
            distance = distances[current_node] + graph[current_node][neighbor]
            # If this distance is shorter than the current shortest distance to the neighbor, update the distance and previous node
            if distance < distances[neighbor]
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                previous[neighbor] = current_node
                # Add the neighbor to the queue with its new priority (shortest distance)
                enqueue!(queue, (distance, neighbor))
            end
        end
    end

    # Create a list to store the nodes in the shortest path
    shortest_path = []
    # Starting from the end node, backtrack through the previous nodes until we reach the start node
    current_node = end_node
    while current_node != start_node
        push!(shortest_path, current_node)
        current_node = previous[current_node]
    end
    # Add the start node to complete the path
    push!(shortest_path, start_node)

    # Reverse the list to get the correct path from start node to end node
    shortest_path = reverse(shortest_path)

    # Return the shortest path and the distance from start node to end node
    return shortest_path, distances[end_node]
end

# Sample graph
graph = Dict(:A => Dict(:B => 3, :C => 5, :D => 1), :B => Dict(:C => 2, :D => 3), :C => Dict(:D => 4), :D => Dict())

# Find the shortest path from node A to node D
shortest_path, distance = dijkstra(graph, :A, :D)

# Print the path and distance
println("Shortest path from A to D: ", shortest_path)
println("Distance from A to D: ", distance)

# Output:
# Shortest path from A to D: Symbol[:A, :D]
# Distance from A to D: 1
