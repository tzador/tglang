"""
This is a complex code snippet in Julia.
It creates a function called "find_minimum" that takes in three arguments:
1. "f": a function that returns a single value
2. "start_point": a vector that represents the starting point of the minimum search
3. "iterations": an integer that represents the number of iterations to perform
The function uses the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm to minimize the given function.
The output is a tuple containing the minimum value and the vector that produces it.
