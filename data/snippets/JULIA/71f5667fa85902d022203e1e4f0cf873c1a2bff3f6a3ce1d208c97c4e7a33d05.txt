# This code snippet generates a frequency plot from a randomly generated dataset
using Statistics

# randomly generate 1000 data points from a normal distribution
x = randn(1000)

# create a histogram with 20 bins and label the x and y axes
histogram(x, bins = 20, xlabel = "Data Points", ylabel = "Frequency")

# add a title to the plot
title!("Frequency Plot")

# display the plot
display(gcf())
