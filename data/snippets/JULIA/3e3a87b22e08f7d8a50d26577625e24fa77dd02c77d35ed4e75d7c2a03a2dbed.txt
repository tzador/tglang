# Define a function named "calculate_mean" that takes in an array of numbers as a parameter
function calculate_mean(array)
    # Initialize a variable "sum" with a value of 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through each number in the array
    for num in array
        # Add the number to the "sum" variable
        sum += num
    end
    # Divide the "sum" variable by the length of the array to get the mean
    mean = sum/length(array)
    return mean # This line is optional, as Julia automatically returns the last expression
end

# Define an array of numbers
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

# Call the "calculate_mean" function with the "numbers" array as a parameter and store the result in a variable "result"
