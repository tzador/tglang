# define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
function factorial(n)
    # create a variable to store the result
    result = 1
    # loop through numbers from 1 to n
    for i in 1:n
        # multiply the current result by the current number
        result *= i

# call the function with input 5
factorial(5) # returns 120

# calculate the factorial of 10 and store it in a variable

# print the value of the variable
println("The factorial of 10 is $fact_10") # outputs "The factorial of 10 is 3628800"
