# Define a function named "factorial" that takes in one argument, "n"
function factorial(n)
    # Create a variable "result" to store the factorial value
    result = 1
    # Loop from 1 to n
    for i in 1:n
        # Multiply the current value of "result" by the loop index i
        result *= i
    end
    # Return the final value of "result"
    return result
end

# Call the "factorial" function and pass in the value 5 as the argument
factorial(5)

# The output should be 120, which is the factorial value of 5 (5*4*3*2*1)
