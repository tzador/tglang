"""
This is a function that calculates the nth term of a Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
Input:
    - n : the nth term of the sequence to be calculated

Output:
    - the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence

Example:
    - If n = 5, the output would be 5 because the 5th term of the Fibonacci sequence is also 5.

function fibonacci(n)
    if n < 1 # Base case
        return 0 # Returns 0 if n is less than 1
    elseif n == 1 # Another base case
        return 1 # Returns 1 if n is equal to 1
    else
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) # Recursive call to calculate nth term of sequence
