# This is a code snippet in JULIA
 
# Declare a function named 'fib' that takes in a parameter 'n'

    # If n is greater than or equal to 1, set the second element of 'seq' to 1
    if n >= 1
        seq[2] = 1
    end
 
    # If n is greater than or equal to 2, use a for loop to generate the rest of the sequence
    if n >= 2
        for i = 3:n+1
 
            # The value of each element in 'seq' is the sum of the previous two elements
            seq[i] = seq[i-1] + seq[i-2]

# Call the function and print the result
