# Define a function called 'calculate_sum' which takes in two parameters 'x' and 'y'
function calculate_sum(x, y)

end

# Call the function with arguments 5 and -3
calculate_sum(5, -3)

# Output:
The sum of x and y is: 2
The sum is positive

# Call the function with arguments -10 and -15
calculate_sum(-10, -15)

# Output:
The sum of x and y is: -25
The sum is negative
