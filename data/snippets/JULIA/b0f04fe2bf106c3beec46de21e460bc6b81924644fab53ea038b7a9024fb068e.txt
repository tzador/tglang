### This is a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

function factorial(n)
    if n == 0 # base case
        return 1
    else # recursive case
        return n * factorial(n-1)
    end
end

### This is a loop that prints the first 10 fibonacci numbers

fib = [0, 1] # initialize array with first two fibonacci numbers
for i in 3:10 # loop from third number to tenth number
    push!(fib, fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]) # calculate and add fibonacci number to array
end
println(fib) # print array with fibonacci numbers
