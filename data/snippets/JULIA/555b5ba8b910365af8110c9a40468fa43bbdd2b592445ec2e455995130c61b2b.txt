    # and prints out the character along with its index position

str = "Hello world!"

# Call the iterate function with the sample string as input

# Output:

# Character at index 3: l
# Character at index 4: l
# Character at index 5: o
# Character at index 6: 
# Character at index 7: w
# Character at index 8: o
# Character at index 9: r
