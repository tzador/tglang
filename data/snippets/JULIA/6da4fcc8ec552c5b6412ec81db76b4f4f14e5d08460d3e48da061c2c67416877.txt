# Define a function named "fib" that takes in one input parameter, "n"
# This function calculates and returns the nth value in the Fibonacci sequence
# Assume that the first two values in the sequence are 0 and 1
function fib(n)
  # Define an empty array to store the sequence values
  fib_seq = []
  # Loop through the first two elements and add them to the array
  for i in 1:2
    push!(fib_seq, i-1)
  end
  # Loop through the rest of the sequence and calculate each value using the previous two
  for i in 3:n+1
    # Add the sum of the previous two values to the array
    push!(fib_seq, fib_seq[i-2] + fib_seq[i-1])
  end
  # Return the nth value in the sequence by indexing the array
  return fib_seq[n+1]

# Call the function with the input parameter "10" and print the output
