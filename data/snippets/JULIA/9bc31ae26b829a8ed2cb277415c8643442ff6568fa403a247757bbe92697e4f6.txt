function fibonacci(n)
    # This function calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
    # Input: n - the number in the sequence (starts at 1)
    # Output: the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
    
    # Initialize variables
    fib_array = [0, 1]  # An array to store the Fibonacci sequence
    i = 2  # The index of the current number being calculated
    
    # Loop until the nth number is reached
    while i <= n
        # Calculate the next number in the sequence
        next_num = fib_array[i-1] + fib_array[i-2]
        
        # Update the array with the next number
        push!(fib_array, next_num)
        
        # Increment the index
        i += 1
    end
    
    # Return the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
    return fib_array[n]
end

# Calculate the 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci(10)  # Output: 34
