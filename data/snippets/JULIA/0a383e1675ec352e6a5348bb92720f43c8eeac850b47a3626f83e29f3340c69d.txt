#= This code snippet demonstrates how to create a function that takes in three arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the arguments. =#

# Define the function with the name `sum_of_squares` and three arguments: a, b, and c
function sum_of_squares(a, b, c)
	
	# Calculate the square of `a` and assign it to the variable `a_squared`
    a_squared = a^2
	
	# Calculate the square of `b` and assign it to the variable `b_squared`
    b_squared = b^2
	
	# Calculate the square of `c` and assign it to the variable `c_squared`
    c_squared = c^2
	
	# Add the squares of a, b, and c and return the result
    return a_squared + b_squared + c_squared 
end

# Call the function with arguments 3, 4, and 5 and assign the result to the variable `result`
result = sum_of_squares(3, 4, 5)

# Print the result
println("The result is: ", result)

# Output:
