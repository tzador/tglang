# This code snippet calculates the value of pi using the Leibniz formula

# Define function for calculating pi using Leibniz formula
function calculate_pi(iterations)
    # Initialize sum variable
    sum = 0
    
    # Loop through specified number of iterations
    for i in 0:iterations-1
        # Calculate term in formula
        term = (-1)^i / (2i + 1)
        
        # Update sum value
        sum += term 
    end
    
    # Multiply sum by 4 to get final value of pi
    pi = 4 * sum
    
    # Return calculated value of pi
    return pi
end

# Set number of iterations for calculation
iterations = 100000000

# Call function to calculate pi with specified number of iterations
pi = calculate_pi(iterations)

# Print the calculated value of pi
println(pi)
