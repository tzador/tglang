# Define function to calculate the factorial of a number
function factorial(n)
    # Set initial answer as 1
    answer = 1
    # Loop from 1 to n
    for i in 1:n
        # Multiply answer by current value of i
        answer *= i
    end
    # Return answer
    return answer
end

# Define variable for user input
n = 6

# Calculate and print factorial of n
print("Factorial of ", n, " is ", factorial(n))

# Output: Factorial of 6 is 720
