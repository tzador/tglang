# This code snippet creates a function that implements the binary search algorithm
# for a sorted array of integers

function binary_search(arr::Array{Int64}, key)
    low = 1  # initializing the low index to 1
    high = length(arr) # initializing the high index to the length of the array
    while low <= high # loop until low index is less than or equal to high index
        mid = (low + high) รท 2 # calculating the midpoint index
        if arr[mid] == key # if key is found at midpoint, return the index
            return mid
        elseif arr[mid] < key # if key is greater than midpoint value, search in right half
            low = mid + 1 # updating the low index
        else
            high = mid - 1 # if key is less than midpoint value, search in left half
        end
    end
    return -1 # if key is not found, return -1
end

# example usage
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
key = 9
println("Index of key $key is $(binary_search(arr, key))") # prints "Index of key 9 is 5"
key = 4
println("Index of key $key is $(binary_search(arr, key))") # prints "Index of key 4 is -1"
