    # This function calculates the product of two numbers using recursion

# The following code calls the function and prints the result
result = recursive_function(5, 3)
println("The product is $result") # Output: The product is 15

# Alternatively, the product can be calculated using the built-in `mul` function
println("The product is $(mul(5,3))") # Output: The product is 15
