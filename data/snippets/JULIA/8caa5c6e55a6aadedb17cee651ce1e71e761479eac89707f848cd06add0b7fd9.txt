# Define a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to n
function fibonacci(n)
  # Create an array to store the sequence
  fib = [0, 1]
  
  # Loop through n-2 times as we have already added the first two elements
  for i in 3:n
    # Calculate the next number by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence
    next_num = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]
    # Add the new number to the array
    push!(fib, next_num)
  end
  
  # Return the resulting array
  return fib
end

# Call the function with an input value of 10
result = fibonacci(10)

# Print the resulting sequence
println("The Fibonacci sequence up to 10 is: ", result)

# Expected output:
# The Fibonacci sequence up to 10 is: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
