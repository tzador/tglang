## Define a struct named "Employee" with attributes "name", "age", "department" and "salary"
mutable struct Employee
    name::String
    age::Int
    department::String
    salary::Float64
end

## Create an array of three Employee structs
employees = [Employee("John", 25, "Marketing", 5000.0), Employee("Jane", 30, "Finance", 7000.0), Employee("Adam", 35, "Human Resources", 6000.0)]

## Create a function to print the information of an Employee
function printEmployee(employee::Employee)
    println("Name: ", employee.name)
    println("Age: ", employee.age)
    println("Department: ", employee.department)
    println("Salary: ", employee.salary)
end

## Loop through the array of employees and print their information
for employee in employees
    printEmployee(employee)
end
