# Define function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion
function factorial(n)
    if n == 0 # base case
        return 1
    else
        return n * factorial(n-1) # recursive step
    end
end

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [2, 4, 6]

# Use a list comprehension to call the factorial function on each number in the list and store the results in a new list
factorial_results = [factorial(x) for x in numbers]

# Print the factorial results for each number in the original list
for i in 1:length(numbers)
    println("The factorial of $(numbers[i]) is $(factorial_results[i])")
end

# Output:
# The factorial of 2 is 2
# The factorial of 4 is 24
# The factorial of 6 is 720
