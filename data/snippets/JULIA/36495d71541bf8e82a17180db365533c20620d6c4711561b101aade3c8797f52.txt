#= This code snippet generates a random 10x10 matrix and finds its inverse =#
using LinearAlgebra # Importing the LinearAlgebra package

# Randomly generate a 10x10 matrix
A = rand(10, 10)

# Find the inverse of the matrix using the 'inv' function from LinearAlgebra package
A_inv = inv(A)

# Print the original matrix and its inverse for comparison
print("Original matrix: ", A, "\n")
print("Inverse matrix: ", A_inv)
