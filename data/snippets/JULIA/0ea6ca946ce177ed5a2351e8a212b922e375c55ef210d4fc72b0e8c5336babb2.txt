# This code snippet is a function called 'sum_and_multiply' that takes in two arrays, 
# calculates the sum of the elements of each array, and multiplies them together.
# It then returns the result as a string.

function sum_and_multiply(array1::Array, array2::Array)
    # Set initial values for sum and product
    sum = 0
    product = 1

    # Loop through each element in array1 and add it to the sum
    for i in 1:length(array1)
        sum += array1[i]
    end

    # Loop through each element in array2 and multiply it to the product
    for j in 1:length(array2)
        product *= array2[j]
    end

    # Convert sum and product to a string and concatenate them
    result = string(sum) * string(product)

    # Return the result
    return result
end

# Example usage of the function
array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
array2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]

result = sum_and_multiply(array1, array2) # result = "10640"
