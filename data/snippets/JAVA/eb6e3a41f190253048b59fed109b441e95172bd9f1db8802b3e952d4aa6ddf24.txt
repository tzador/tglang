// This is a complex code snippet in JAVA, showing an example of a binary search algorithm
// Binary search function takes in an array of integers and a target value to search for
public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int low = 0; //initialize the lower bound of the search range
    int high = arr.length - 1; //initialize the upper bound of the search range
    while (low <= high) { //run the search until the lower bound is equal to or greater than the upper bound
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; //calculate the middle index of the search range
        if (arr[mid] == target) { //if the middle value is equal to the target, return the index
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) { //if the middle value is less than the target, adjust the lower bound to mid + 1
            low = mid + 1;
        } else { //if the middle value is greater than the target, adjust the upper bound to mid - 1
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1; //if the target is not found, return -1
