//This code snippet is a Java program that calculates the factorial of a given number.
//The input is taken from the user and the factorial is calculated using a recursive function.

//Importing the java.util package for Scanner class
import java.util.*;

//Defining a class named Factorial
class Factorial {
    
    //Recursive function to calculate factorial
    static int factorial(int n) {
        if(n == 0 || n == 1) //Base case
            return 1;
        else
            return n * factorial(n - 1); //Recursive call
    }
    
    //Main method
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        
        //Initializing a Scanner object to take user input
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        //Declaring and initializing variable to store input
        int num;
        
        //Taking input from user
        System.out.println("Enter a number:");
        num = sc.nextInt();
        
        //Calculating factorial using recursive function
        int fact = factorial(num);
        
        //Printing the result
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + num + " is: " + fact);
        
        //Closing the Scanner object
        sc.close();
