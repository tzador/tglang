//This is an example of a bubble sort algorithm in Java
public void bubbleSort(int[] array){

    //Variable to check if a swap was made

    //Loop through the array until no swaps are made
    for(int i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++){
        //Loop through the array from beginning to end - i
        for(int j = 0; j < array.length - 1 - i; j++){
            //Check if the current element is greater than the next element
            if(array[j] > array[j+1]){
                //Swap the elements
                int temp = array[j];
                array[j] = array[j+1];

        //If no swaps were made, the array is sorted and we can break out of the loop
        if(!swapped){
            break;

//Example call to bubbleSort method
int[] array = {5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 4};
bubbleSort(array);

//Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8} - the sorted array
