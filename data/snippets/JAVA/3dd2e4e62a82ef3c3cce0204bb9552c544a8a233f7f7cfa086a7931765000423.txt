// This program calculates the factorial of a given number

// Declaring and initializing variables
int num = 5; // Number whose factorial is to be calculated
int factorial = 1; // Variable to store the factorial value

// Loop to calculate the factorial
for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i) {
   factorial *= i; // Updating the factorial value with each iteration
}

// Printing the result
System.out.println("Factorial of " + num + " is: " + factorial);
