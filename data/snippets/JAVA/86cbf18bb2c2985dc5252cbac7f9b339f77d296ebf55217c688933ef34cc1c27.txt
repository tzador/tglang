/*
This is a complex code snippet in Java that uses multiple advanced features of the language.

First, we define a class called "DataProcessor" that implements the "Runnable" interface, allowing it to be executed in its own thread.

Inside the class, we declare a private array of integers called "data" and a private integer called "result".

Next, we override the "run()" method from the "Runnable" interface. In this method, we use a "for" loop to iterate through the "data" array and calculate the sum of its elements, storing the result in the "result" variable.

After that, we define a "main()" method where we create an instance of the "DataProcessor" class and start a new thread with it using the "Thread" class.

We also use a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur while the thread is running.

Finally, we use the "join()" method to wait for the thread to finish its execution and then print out the result of the data processing.
