/**
 * This is a complex code snippet in JAVA that demonstrates the use of recursion to find the factorial of a given number.
 * The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers from 1 up to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.
 * This code uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial and outputs the result.

        if (num == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        // Recursive case: if the number is greater than 1, call the function again with a decrease of 1 in the number and multiply it with the current number
