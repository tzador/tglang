/**
* This is a simple Java program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
* Factorial is a mathematical operation where the product of all the numbers from 1 to a given number is calculated.
* In this program, we will use the concept of recursion to calculate factorial.
* Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself as a subroutine to solve a smaller version of the problem.
* To calculate factorial recursively, we will call the factorial function with the number - 1 until we reach 1.
* Then we will multiply the number with the result of the factorial function, thus giving us the factorial value.
