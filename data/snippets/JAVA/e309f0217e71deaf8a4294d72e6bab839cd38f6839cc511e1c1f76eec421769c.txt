// This code snippet is a Java program that uses recursion to find the factorial of a given number

public class Factorial {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int num = 5; // number whose factorial needs to be found
    int result = factorial(num); // calling the factorial method
    System.out.println("The factorial of " + num + " is " + result);
  }

  // recursive method to find the factorial of a number
  public static int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) { // base case
      return 1; // factorial of 0 is 1
    } else {
      return (n * factorial(n - 1)); // recursive call to find factorial of (n-1)
    }
  }
}

// Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
