// Definition of a struct named 'Car' with two fields
struct Car {
    model: String,
    year: i32,
}

// Implementation of a method 'drive' for the 'Car' struct
impl Car {
    fn drive(&self) {
        println!("Driving a {} from {}!", self.model, self.year);
    }
}

// Creation of an instance of the 'Car' struct
let my_car = Car {
    model: String::from("Tesla Model S"),
    year: 2021,
};

// Calling the 'drive' method on the 'my_car' instance
my_car.drive();

// Output:
`Driving a Tesla Model S from 2021!`
