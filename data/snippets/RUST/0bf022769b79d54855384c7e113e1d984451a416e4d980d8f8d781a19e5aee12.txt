// This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
// The function takes an integer as its input and returns an unsigned integer as its output

fn factorial(num: i32) -> u64 {
    let mut fact = 1;
    let mut i = 1;
    // Loop through all numbers from 1 up to the given number
    while i <= num {
        // Multiplying the current factorial value by the current number
        fact = fact * i;
        // Incrementing the current number by 1
        i = i + 1;
    }
    // Returning the factorial value
    fact
}

// Calling the function and passing in a number
let input_num = 5;
// Storing the output of the function in a variable
let factorial_value = factorial(input_num);
// Printing the output
println!("The factorial of {} is {}", input_num, factorial_value);
// Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
