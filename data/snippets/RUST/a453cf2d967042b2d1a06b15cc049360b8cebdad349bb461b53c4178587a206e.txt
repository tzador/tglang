// Define a struct named 'Employee' with three fields

    // Define a method to calculate the employee's annual salary
    fn calculate_annual_salary(&self) -> f64 {
        self.salary * 12.0 // Multiply monthly salary by 12 to get annual salary
    }

// Create a new instance of the 'Employee' struct
let employee_one = Employee::new(String::from("John Doe"), 25, 5000.0);

// Call the method to calculate the annual salary for the employee
let annual_salary = employee_one.calculate_annual_salary();

// Print the employee's name and annual salary in a formatted string
println!("{}'s annual salary is ${:.2}", \
