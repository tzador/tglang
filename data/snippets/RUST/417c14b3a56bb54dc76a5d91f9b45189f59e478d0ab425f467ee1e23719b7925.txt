// This is a rust program that prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
// The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1

// Defining the main function that takes in one argument
fn main() {
    // Initializing variables for the first two numbers in the sequence
    let mut n = 0;
    let mut m = 1;
    // Initializing a variable for the total number of numbers to be printed
    let number = 10;
    
    // Printing the first number in the sequence
    println!("Fibonacci Sequence:");
    print!("{} ", n);

    // Using a for loop to loop through the rest of the numbers
    for _i in 1..number {
        // Initializing a variable to store the next number in the sequence
        let new_num = n + m;
        // Assigning the current number to the previous number for the next iteration
        n = m;
        // Assigning the next number to be printed
        m = new_num;
        // Printing the next number in the sequence
        print!("{} ", m);
    }
