// Define a struct called "Person" with three fields: name, age, and occupation
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
    occupation: String,
}

// Implement a function for the Person struct that calculates the person's remaining years until retirement
impl Person {
    fn years_until_retirement(&self) -> u32 {
        const RETIREMENT_AGE: u32 = 65;
        if self.age < RETIREMENT_AGE {
            return RETIREMENT_AGE - self.age;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}

// Create an instance of the Person struct with the name "John", age 50, and occupation "Engineer"
let john = Person {
    name: String::from("John"),
    age: 50,
    occupation: String::from("Engineer"),
};

// Call the years_until_retirement function on the john instance and print the result
println!("John has {} years until retirement", john.years_until_retirement());

// Output: John has 15 years until retirement
