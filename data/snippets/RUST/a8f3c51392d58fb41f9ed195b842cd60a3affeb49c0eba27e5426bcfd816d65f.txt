//! This is a comment in Rust that documents the following piece of code
fn main() {
    for i in 0..10 {    // `i` is a variable that takes on the values from 0 to 9
        if i % 2 == 0 { // check if `i` is divisible by 2
            println!("{} is even", i); // if yes, print the value of `i` followed by "is even"
        } else { // if not, print the value of `i` followed by "is odd"
            println!("{} is odd", i);
        }
    }
