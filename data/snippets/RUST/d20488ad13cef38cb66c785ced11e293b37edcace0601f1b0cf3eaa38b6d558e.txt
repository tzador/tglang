// This code snippet calculates the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers up to 100 using a while loop and conditional statements.

// The "fn" keyword indicates the declaration of a function, followed by the function's name (in this case, "main") and a set of curly braces {} enclosing the function's body.

// The "let" keyword declares a variable, followed by the variable's name and an equals sign (=) before the variable's initial value.

// The "mut" keyword makes the variable mutable, meaning its value can be changed throughout the program.

// The while loop checks the condition (in this case, if "num" is less than 100) and executes the loop's body if the condition is true.

// The "if" statement checks if "num" is an even number (determined by using the modulo operator %) and adds it to the "sum" variable if true.

// The "let" keyword is used again to declare a temporary variable "temp" which stores the value of "next".

// The "next" variable is then updated to be the sum of "num" and "next", effectively moving onto the next Fibonacci number.

// Lastly, the values of "next" and "num" are swapped using the temporary variable, ensuring the loop continues until "num" reaches 100.

// The "println!" macro is used to print the value of "sum" to the console. The "{}" acts as a placeholder for the variable's value. 

// Output: 44 (The sum of all even Fibonacci numbers up to 100)
