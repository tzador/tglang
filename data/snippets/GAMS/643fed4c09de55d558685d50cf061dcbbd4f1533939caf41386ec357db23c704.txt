    i   Plants   / p1*p5 /;
    
Parameters
    a(i)    Capacity of plants
            / p1 350
              p2 400
              p3 450
              p4 500
              p5 600 /;  # Sets the capacity of each plant

Variables
    x(i)    Production level of plants
    c       Total cost;     # Declares a variable for total cost of production

Positive Variables x;    # Declares 'x' as a positive variable

Equations
    Cost    Objective function
            c =e= sum(i, 10*a(i)*x(i)*x(i) + 40*a(i)*x(i));    # Sets the objective function to minimize production cost

Constraints
    Supply(i)   Supply constraint for each plant
                x(i) =l= a(i);  # Sets the production level for each plant to be less than or equal to its capacity

Model Production /all/;    # Creates a model with all the elements defined above

option optcr = 0.001;    # Sets the optimality threshold for the solver

Solve Production using NLP minimizing c;    # Solves the model using a non-linear programming (NLP) solver to minimize the cost
