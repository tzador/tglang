Sets
    i 'subset of nodes in network'
    j 'subset of nodes in network'
    k 'subset of nodes in network';

Parameters
    d(i,j) 'distance between node i and node j'
    cost(i,j) 'cost of building an edge between node i and node j';

Binary Variables
    x(i,j) 'binary decision variable, 1 if an edge is built between i and j, 0 otherwise';

Positive Variable
    z 'objective variable, total cost of building edges';

Equation
    obj 'objective function'
    constr(i) 'constraint on total number of edges built at node i';

obj.. z =e= sum((i,j), cost(i,j)*x(i,j));

constr(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= 1;
