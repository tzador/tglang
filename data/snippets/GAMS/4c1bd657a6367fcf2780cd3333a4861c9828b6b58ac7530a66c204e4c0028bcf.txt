$Title Example of a Complex GAMS Code;

Set
    i Cities /City_1, City_2, City_3/
    j Products /Product_1, Product_2, Product_3/;

Parameter
    c(i) Cost of opening a factory in each city
    /City_1 100, City_2 150, City_3 200/;

Table d(i,j) Distance between cities and production centers
         Product_1  Product_2  Product_3
City_1      50         60         100
City_2      80         40         120
City_3      120        90         70;

Variable
    x(i,j)  Amount of product shipped from each city to each production center
    y(i)    Binary variable representing if a factory is open in each city;

Positive Variable x;
Binary Variable y;

x.Lower(i,j) = 0;
x.Lower(i,j) = 0;
x.Lower(i,j) = 0;

x.Upper(i,j) = 10;
y.Upper(i) = 1;

Equation
    Cost_of_Operating   Objective function calculating the total cost of operating factories
    Supply(i)           Constraint ensuring that the total amount shipped from each city is less than or equal to the capacity
    Open_Factory(i)     Constraint ensuring that a factory can only be opened in one city
    Shipment(j)         Constraint ensuring that the total amount of each product shipped is equal to the demand;

Cost_of_Operating.. sum(i, c(i)*y(i)) =e= sum((i,j), d(i,j)*x(i,j));

Supply(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= 300;

Open_Factory(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= 10*y(i);

Shipment(j).. sum(i, x(i,j)) =e= 200;
