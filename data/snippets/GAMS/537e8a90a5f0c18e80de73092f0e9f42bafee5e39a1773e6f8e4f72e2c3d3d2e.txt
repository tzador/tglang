set TIME 'set of time periods' /t1*t5/;
set PRODUCTS 'set of products' /a,b,c,d/;
parameter DEMAND(TIME,PRODUCTS) 'demand of products during time periods';

*declaring variables
positive variable x(TIME,PRODUCTS) 'amount of products produced during time periods';
variable cost(TIME,PRODUCTS) 'production costs of products during time periods';
variable revenue(TIME,PRODUCTS) 'revenue of products during time periods';
variable profit(TIME,PRODUCTS) 'profit of products during time periods';

*defining cost and revenue equations
equation production_cost(TIME,PRODUCTS);
production_cost(TIME,PRODUCTS).. cost(TIME,PRODUCTS) =e= 100*x(TIME,PRODUCTS);

equation product_demand(TIME,PRODUCTS);
product_demand(TIME,PRODUCTS).. revenue(TIME,PRODUCTS) =e= DEMAND(TIME,PRODUCTS)*x(TIME,PRODUCTS);

*defining objective function
equation objective;
objective.. profit(TIME,PRODUCTS) =e= revenue(TIME,PRODUCTS) - cost(TIME,PRODUCTS);

*defining constraints
equation total_production_constraint;
total_production_constraint.. sum(TIME,PRODUCTS, x(TIME,PRODUCTS)) =l= 1000;

equation product_proportions;
product_proportions.. sum(PRODUCTS, x(TIME,PRODUCTS)) =e= 1;

equation minimum_demand_constraint(TIME,PRODUCTS);
minimum_demand_constraint(TIME,PRODUCTS).. x(TIME,PRODUCTS) =g= 50;

*executing the model
solve;
