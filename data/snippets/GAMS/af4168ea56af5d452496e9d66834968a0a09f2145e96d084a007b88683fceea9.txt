* Setting up and solving a linear programming problem using GAMS

* Define variables
Variables
x "Amount of Product X"
y "Amount of Product Y";

* Define constraints
Equations
constraint1 "Total amount of X and Y"
constraint2 "X must be greater than Y"
constraint3 "Total cost constraint";

* Define objective function
Positive variables x, y;
Equation profit "Profit function";
profit.. z =e= 10*x + 8*y;

* Set up constraints and solve
Model lp /all/;

constraint1.. x + y =e= 100;
constraint2.. x =g= y;
constraint3.. 10*x + 8*y =l= 800;

Solve lp maximizing profit using lp;

* Print solution
Display x.l, y.l, profit.l;
