Sets
    i /1*10/
    j /1*10/;

Parameters
    a(i,j)
    b(i,j);

a(i,j) = uniformInt(1,10);       ** generate random integers between 1 and 10 for parameter a **
b(i,j) = sin(i)*cos(j);          ** calculate values for parameter b using sine and cosine functions **

Variables
    x(i)
    y(j);

Equations
    firstEquation
    secondEquation
    thirdEquation
    fourthEquation;

firstEquation.. x(i) =e= sum(j, a(i,j)*y(j));     ** constraint that sets the value of x to be the sum of a(i,j)*y(j) **
secondEquation.. x(i) =l= y(j) + b(i,j);           ** lower bound constraint that sets x(i) to be less than or equal to y(j) + b(i,j) **
thirdEquation.. y(j) =e= sum(i, a(i,j)*x(i));      ** constraint that sets the value of y to be the sum of a(i,j)*x(i) **
fourthEquation.. y(j) =g= x(i) - b(i,j);           ** upper bound constraint that sets y(j) to be greater than or equal to x(i) - b(i,j) **

Model myModel /all/;

Solve myModel maximizing x using lp;            ** solve the model by maximizing the variable x using linear programming **

Display x.l, y.l;           ** display the values of the solved variables x and y **
