* This example GAMS model demonstrates the use of decision variables and constraints

Sets
    i   customers /Chicago, NewYork, LosAngeles/
    j   warehouses /Topeka, Denver/

Parameters
    c(i)   cost of shipping from customers
    d(j)   cost of building warehouses

Table t(i,j)   cost of shipping from customers to warehouses

i      j       Topeka   Denver
Chicago            10       6
NewYork             8       5
LosAngeles          9       7

Variables
    x(j)   warehouses to be built
    p(i,j)   amount to be shipped from customers to warehouses

Positive Variable p;
Binary Variable x;

Equations
    Objective
    Cost
    Supply(i)
    Demand(j)
    Link(i,j)

Objective..    z= sum((i,j), t(i,j)*p(i,j) + d(j)*x(j)); 

Cost..         x(j)=e=1;
Supply(i)..    sum(j, p(i,j))=l=c(i);
Demand(j)..    sum(i, p(i,j))=l=x(j);
Link(i,j)..    p(i,j)=l=x(j);

Model shipping /all/;

Solve shipping using lp minimizing z;

Display p.l, "Amount to be shipped from customers to warehouses";
Display x.l, "Number of warehouses to be built";
