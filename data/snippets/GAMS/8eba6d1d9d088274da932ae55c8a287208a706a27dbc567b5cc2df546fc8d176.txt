* This is a GAMS code snippet that solves a linear programming problem 
* This problem minimizes costs while meeting certain constraints

***** Sets and Parameters *****

Set products    /p1*p5/;        * set of products
Set resources   /r1*r4/;        * set of resources 

Parameter c 'cost of each product'
         /p1 100, p2 200, p3 300, p4 150, p5 250/;       * cost for each product

Parameter b 'available amount of each resource'
         /r1 500, r2 700, r3 1000, r4 600/;              * available amount for each resource
         
***** Variables *****

Variable x(products) 'amount of each product used';

***** Objective Function *****

Equation obj 'objective function' using x;

obj.. sum(products, c(products)*x(products)) =e= z;    * objective is to minimize total cost

***** Constraints *****

Equation res1 'resource constraint for r1';
res1.. sum(products, x(products)) =l= b('r1');         * resource r1 constraint

Equation res2 'resource constraint for r2';
res2.. sum(products, 2*x('p1')+3*x('p2')) =l= b('r3') - 4;  * resource r2 constraint using specific products

Equation res3 'resource constraint for r3';
res3.. sum(products, c(products)*x(products)) =l= b('r3') + sum(resources, b(resources));  * resource r3 constraint using both products and resources

***** Solve the model *****

Model lp 'linear programming' /all/;
Solve lp using lp minimizing z;
