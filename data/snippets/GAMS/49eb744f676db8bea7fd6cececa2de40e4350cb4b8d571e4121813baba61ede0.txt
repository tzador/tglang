* Declaration of Sets
Set i canning plants / seattle, san-diego /;
Set j markets / new-york, chicago, topeka /;

* Declaration of Data
Parameter a(i) "capacity of plant i in cases";
Parameter b(j) "demand at market j in cases";
Table d(i, j) "distance in thousands of miles";
Scalar f "freight in dollars per case per thousand miles / 90 /";

* Declaration of Variables
Positive Variable x(i, j) "shipment quantities in cases";
Positive Variable z "total transportation costs in thousands of dollars";

* Objective Function
Equation cost "total transportation costs in thousands of dollars";
cost.. z =e= sum((i, j), f * d(i, j) * x(i, j));

* Constraints
Equation supply(i) "observe supply limit at plant i in cases"
        d(i,*) - sum(j, x(i, j)) =l= 0;

Equation demand(j) "satisfy demand at market j in cases";
demand(j).. sum(i, x(i, j)) =g= b(j);

* Solve the Model
