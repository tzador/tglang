*This is a model to optimize production and shipping costs*

Sets  i "plants"  / plant1, plant2, plant3 /
      j "markets" / market1, market2, market3 /;

Parameters
   a(i)  "production capacity of plant i"
   b(j)  "demand of market j"
   d(i,j) "distance between plant i and market j"
   p     "transportation cost per unit"
   r     "production cost per unit";

Scalars
   cost;
   
Variables
   x(i) "amount produced at plant i"
   y(i,j) "amount shipped from plant i to market j";

Positive Variables x, y;

Equations
   obj       "objective function"
   supply(i) "production at plant i"
   demand(j) "demand at market j";

obj..
   cost =e= sum((i,j), p*d(i,j)*y(i,j) + r*x(i));

supply(i)..
   x(i) =l= a(i);

demand(j)..
   sum(i, y(i,j)) =g= b(j);

Model shipping /all/;
