Sets
        i      commodities   / coal, wheat, steel /
        j      processes     / mine, transport, mill, bake, sell /;

Parameters
        a(i)   cost of producing one unit of commodity i
        b(j)   processing capacity in process j
        d(j)   demand for output of process j
        profit(i)  expected profit from selling one unit of commodity i ;

Table t(i,j) 	transport cost of commodity i to process j ; 

t(i,j) 	$(t("coal","mine")=1,      t("coal","transport")=1,
           t("wheat","transport")=1,
           t("steel","mill")=1,
           t("steel","bake")=1,
           t("steel","sell")=1/,
           t(i,j)       = t(i,"transport")) ; 

Positive Variable x(i,j), z ; 

Equations
        cost        define objective function
        supply(i)   observe supply limit at source i
        demand(j)   satisfy demand at process j ;

cost ..      z  =e=  sum(i, sum(j, a(i)*x(i,j) + t(i,j)*b(j)*x(i,j))) ;

supply(i) ..  sum(j, x(i,j))  =l=  b(i) ;

demand(j) ..  sum(i, x(i,j))  =g=  d(j) ;

Model transport /all/ ;

Solve transport using lp minimizing z;
