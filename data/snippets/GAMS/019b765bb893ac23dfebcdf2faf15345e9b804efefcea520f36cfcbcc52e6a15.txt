* Example of a GAMS model
Set i /1*3/;
Variables x(i), y, z;
Equations obj, c1, c2;
obj.. z =e= y;
c1.. x(i) =g= z;
c2.. x(i) =l= y;
Model test /all/;

* This is a comment in GAMS

* Example of a GAMS set
Set numbers /1*10/;

* Example of a GAMS loop
Loop(i, numbers,
    * This is a nested loop
    Loop(j, numbers,
        c1(i) =g= j;
        c2(j) =l= i;
    );
);

* Solve the GAMS model
solve test maximizing z using lp;
