Sets
i  nodes

Parameters
c(i) cost of nodes
k(i) commodity demand of nodes

Variables
x(i) flow of commodity through nodes
y(i) binary variable for determining if node is used
z objective function for cost minimization

Binary Variables
b(i) additional binary variables for constraint formulation

Equations
def_of_z define objective function z
cost_minimize minimize cost
demand demand constraint for commodity
capacity capacity constraint for nodes
capacity_2 capacity constraint for nodes with additional binary variables
