$title "Optimization Model for Product Distribution" 

*Sets*
Set
   i 'Products' /p1*p20/
   j 'Suppliers' /supplierA*sulierF/
   k 'Regions' /region1*region5/
   l 'Retailers' /retailer1*retailer10/
;

*Parameters*
Parameter
    s(i,j) 'Supply quantity from each supplier per product'
    d(i,k) 'Demand quantity in each region for each product'
    c(i,j,k) 'Cost of shipping each product from each supplier to each region'
    p(i,l) 'Profit for each product sold in each retailer'
;

$onText
This model optimizes the distribution of products from multiple suppliers to various retailers, taking into account the cost of shipping and the potential profit for each product in each retailer.

*Variables*
Variable
	x(i,j,k) 'Quantity of product i shipped from supplier j to region k'
	y(i,l) 'Quantity of product i sold to retailer l'
;

*Equations*
Equation
	supply(i,j) 'Supply must be less than or equal to the quantity available from each supplier for each product'
	demand(i,k) 'Demand must be met in each region for each product'
	profit(i,l) 'Profit must be maximized for each product sold in each retailer'
;

*Constraints*
supply(i,j).. sum(k, x(i,j,k)) =l= s(i,j);
demand(i,k).. sum(j, x(i,j,k)) =e= d(i,k);
profit(i,l).. sum(i, p(i,l)*y(i,l)) =e= sum(k, sum(j, c(i,j,k)*x(i,j,k)));

*Objective Function*
Equation obj 'Maximize Profit';
obj.. sum(i, sum(l, p(i,l)*y(i,l))) =e= obj;
Model distribution /all/;

*Solution*
Distribution.Optfile = 1;
Solve distribution maximizing obj using %model% minlp;
Display x.l, y.l;
