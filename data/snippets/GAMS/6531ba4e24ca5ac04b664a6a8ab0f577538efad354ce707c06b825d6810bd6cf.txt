Set i 'index for node'
    j 'index for link';

Parameter
    a(i) 'flow balance constraint'
    b(i,j) 'transport cost';

Binary Variable x(i,j) 'binary variable for whether link is used';

Equations
    obj 'objective function'
    flow_balance(i) 'flow balance constraint'
    capacity(j) 'capacity constraint';

obj.. sum((i,j), b(i,j)*x(i,j)) =e= sum(i, a(i));

flow_balance(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =e= 1;

capacity(j).. sum(i, x(i,j)) =l= 1;

Model transportation /obj, flow_balance, capacity/;
Option optcr = 0.0001;
Solve transportation using mip minimizing obj;

**Note:** This code snippet creates a transportation model with binary variables, quadratic objective function, and constraints. It then solves the model using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach to minimize the objective function. This is an advanced optimization technique commonly used in transportation and logistics industries.
