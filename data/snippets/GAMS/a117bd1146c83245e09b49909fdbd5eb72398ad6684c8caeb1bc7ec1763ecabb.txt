Sets 
    i       Set of tasks
    t       Set of time periods
    p       Set of products

Parameters
    c(i)    Cost of each task
    d(p,i)  Demand for each product and task
    r(p,t)  Revenue for each product and time period
    b(t)    Budget for each time period
    f(i,t)  Resource requirement for each task and time period

Variables
    x(i,t)  Amount of each task performed in each time period
    y(p,t)  Amount of each product produced in each time period
    z       Total profit

Binary Variables
    A(i,t)  1 if task i is performed in time period t, 0 otherwise
    B(p,i)  1 if product p is produced from task i, 0 otherwise

Equations
    Objective    Calculates the total profit
    Demand(p,t)  Satisfies the demand for each product
    Budget(t)    Ensures the budget is not exceeded
    Resource(i,t)   Ensures resource constraints are met
    Production(p,t)    Defines the amount of each product produced
    Task(i,t)   Defines the amount of each task performed

Objective.. z =e= sum((p,t), r(p,t)*y(p,t)) - sum((i,t), c(i)*x(i,t));

Demand(p,t).. y(p,t) =e= sum(i, B(p,i)*x(i,t)) =g= d(p,i);

Budget(t).. sum(p, sum(i, B(p,i)*x(i,t))) =l= b(t);

Production(p,t).. y(p,t) =e= sum(i, B(p,i)*x(i,t));

Task(i,t).. x(i,t) =l= f(i,t)*A(i,t);

Resource(i,t).. sum(t, x(i,t)) =l= sum(t, f(i,t)*A(i,t));
