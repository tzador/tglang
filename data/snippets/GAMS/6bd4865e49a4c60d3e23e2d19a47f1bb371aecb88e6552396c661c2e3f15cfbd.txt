Parameters

c(i)    unit costs
x(i)    upper bounds for purchases by item
a(i,t)  demands for each item in each period
s(t)    budget for each time period, t
r(i,n)  re-sale values by item
p(i,m)  penalty costs on overproduction by item
w(i,m)  carbon footprint weights for each item and production method;

Variables

z       total stock value
y(i)    purchases by item
m(i)    production method for each item
q(i,t)  production quantities by item and time
v(t)    value added by producing during each period

Equations

objective   objective function
finance     budget constraint
resale      re-sale values
penalty     excess production penalty
carbon      carbon footprint constraint;

* Objective function to maximize the total stock value
objective..  z =e= sum(i, c(i)*y(i))
                + sum(i,w(i,m)*q(i,t));

* Budget constraint - total cost of purchases and production less than or equal to budget for each period.
finance(t).. sum(i, c(i)*y(i) + p(i,m)*q(i,t)) =l= s(t);

* Re-sale values equation - total income from sold items.
resale(n).. sum(i, r(i,n)*q(i,t)) =g= 0;

* Excess production penalty - penalize overproduction by multiplying penalty cost by excess amount.
penalty(m,t).. p(i,m)*q(i,t) + e =g= ifc(q(i,t) > x(i), p(i,m)*(q(i,t) - x(i)), 0);

* Carbon footprint constraint - carbon footprint of each item and production method must not exceed weight.
carbon(i,m).. sum((i,m), w(i,m)*q(i,t)) =l= g;

* Solution with GAMS options
Option compecho=1; * orders output while creating feasible points
Option nlp=convert; * converts nonlinear equations to nonlinear constraints
solve with minlp maximizing z using nlp;
