Variable
    x(i)        Investments to be made;
 
Binary Variable
    y(i)        1 if investment is made, 0 otherwise;
 
Positive Variable
    z           Total cost;
 
Equations
    TotalCost   Define total cost;
    EachRegion  Each region should have at least one investment;
    Restrict    To restrict investments in neighboring regions;
 
TotalCost..  z =e= sum(i, C(i)*x(i));
EachRegion..  sum(i, y(i)) =g= 1;
Restrict..    sum(j, Distance(j,i)*x(i)) =l= sum(j, sum(i, Distance(j,i)*y(i)));
