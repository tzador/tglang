Sets
	i plants
	j locations;

Parameters
	a(i) operational capacity of plants (units/year)
	b(j) capacity expansion cost by location ($/unit)
	c(i) unit production cost at each plant ($/unit)
	d(i,j) distance from each plant to each location (miles)
	e total demand (units/year);

Variables
	x(i,j) amount of units to produce at plant i and send to location j (units/year)
	y(j) expand capacity at location j (units/year);

Positive Variable x, y;

Equations
	obj objective function
	demand meet total demand
	plimit limit on plant capacity;

obj.. y =e= sum((i,j), a(i)*x(i,j) + b(j)*y(j) + c(i)*x(i,j));

demand.. sum(i, x(i,j)) =e= e;

plimit(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= a(i);

Model transportation /all/;

Option optcr = 0.01, reslim = 100;

solve transportation using mip minimizing obj;
