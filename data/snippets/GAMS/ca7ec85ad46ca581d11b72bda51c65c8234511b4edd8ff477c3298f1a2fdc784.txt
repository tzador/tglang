k time periods /t1*t10/;

Parameters
    profit_margin(i) profit margins for each investment option /
    opt1 0.15,
    opt2 0.12,
    opt3 0.1 /;

Scalar available_income total amount of income available for investment /10000/;

Table investment_matrix(i, j) returns for each investment option and income source /

     3 period    1000     1400     2000;

Variable x(i) investments made in each option;
Variable y(i, j) decision variable for each investment option and income source;

Equation
    obj function objective function to maximize returns (sum(i, x(i))),
    con1 total investments made is less than or equal to available income (sum(i, x(i)) <= available_income),
    con2 returns from each investment option is greater than or equal to profit margin (sum(j, y(i, j)*investment_matrix(i, j)) >= profit_margin(i));

Model investment /obj, con1, con2/;
