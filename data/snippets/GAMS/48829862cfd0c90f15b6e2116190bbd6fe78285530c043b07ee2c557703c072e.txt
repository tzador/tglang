* This is a GAMS code snippet that solves a linear programming problem

sets
    i "plants" /1*5/
    j "markets" /A, B, C/;

parameters
    a(i) "capacity of plant"
    b(j) "demand at market";

a(i) = uniform(50, 100);  * set random values for capacity
b(j) = round(10 * uniform(1, 5));  * set random values for demand

variables
    x(i,j) "amount shipped from plant to market"
    z  "total shipping cost";

positive variable x;

equations
    obj "total cost of shipping"
    supply(i) "satisfy plant capacity"
    demand(j) "fulfill market demand";

obj.. z =e= sum((i,j), 0.2 * a(i) * x(i,j));

supply(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= a(i);

demand(j).. sum(i, x(i,j)) =g= b(j);

model linear_programming /all/;

solve linear_programming using lp minimizing z;
