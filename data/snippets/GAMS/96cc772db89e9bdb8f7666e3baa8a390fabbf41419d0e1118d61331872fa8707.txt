$ontext

The following code snippet sets up a transportation problem in the GAMS modeling language. It defines sets, aliases, scalars, tables, and parameters, which are commonly used in mathematical optimization problems. The parameters represent cost and demand data for the transportation problem, while the sets represent different locations and sources for fuel products. The alias command is used to create shorthand notation for referencing these sets. The $ontext command is used to provide additional comments and documentation about the code.
