Set i 'set of investments' /i1*i8/;
Set j 'set of years' /2015*2020/;
Set k 'set of objectives' /revenue, costs, profit/;
Variable X(i,j) 'total investment amount';
Variable Y(j,k) 'total amount per year and objective';
Positive Variable Z 'total investment value';
Equation objectives 'calculate total amount per year and objective';
Equation total 'calculate total investment value';
objectives(j,k).. Y(j,k) =E= sum(i,X(i,j));
total.. Z =E= sum((i,j), X(i,j));
Model  investment /all/;
investment.addCol((i,j), X.L(i,j)) = 30;
investment.obj = -Z;
Solve investment using mip minimize Z;
