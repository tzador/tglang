* This is a GAMS code snippet example
* Sets, parameters, and variables declaration
SETS
       i              'city index' /1*6/
       j              'facility index' /1*4/ ;

PARAMETERS
       c(i)           'cost per unit of demand'
       a(j)           'capacity of facility j'
       b(i)           'demand at city i' ;

VARIABLES
       x(i,j)         'units of supply to be shipped from city i to facility j'
       z              'total transportation costs';

* Objective function
EQUATION TOTAL_COST;
TOTAL_COST..        z =E= sum((i,j), c(i)*x(i,j));

* Constraints
EQUATIONS
       SUPPLY(i)      'total supply to city i'
       DEMAND(j)      'total demand from facility j';

SUPPLY(i)..        sum(j, x(i,j)) =E= b(i);
DEMAND(j)..        sum(i, x(i,j)) =E= a(j);

* Boundary conditions
x.lo(i,j) = 0;

* Solve
MODEL TRANSPORT /TOTAL_COST, SUPPLY, DEMAND/;
SOLVE TRANSPORT USING LP MINIMIZING z;

* Display results
DISPLAY x.l, x.m ;
