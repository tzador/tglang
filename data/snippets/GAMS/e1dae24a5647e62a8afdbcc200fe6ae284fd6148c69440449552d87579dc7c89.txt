Variables
x(i,j)  shipment quantities in cases
z       total transportation costs in thousands of dollars;

Positive Variable x ;
Equations
cost        define objective function
supply(i)   observe supply limit at plant i
demand(j)   satisfy demand at market j
distance    define transportation costs;
Define the objective function
cost ..        z  =e=  f * sum((i,j), d(i,j)*x(i,j)) ;

Meet the supply at plant i

supply(i) ..   sum(j, x(i,j))  =l=  a(i) ;

Satisfy the demand at market j

demand(j) ..   sum(i, x(i,j))  =g=  b(j) ;

Calculate transportation costs with distance and shipment quantities

distance ..    z  =e=  f * sum((i,j), d(i,j)*x(i,j)) ;
