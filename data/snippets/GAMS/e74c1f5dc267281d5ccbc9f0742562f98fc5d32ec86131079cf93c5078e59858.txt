Set i /i1*i10/;        \\ Declares a set i with elements i1 to i10
Alias (i,j);           \\ Sets j as an alias for i for easier indexing
Parameter c(i);        \\ Declares a parameter c with i as its index set
Binary Variable x(i);  \\ Declares a binary variable x with i as its index set
Positive Variable y;   \\ Declares a positive variable y
Equations obj, con, con2;
obj.. sum(i, c(i)*x(i)) =e= y;       \\ Objective function
con(i).. 2*x(i) =e= 1;               \\ Constraints
con2(j).. sum(i, x(i)) + y =e= 3*j;  \\ Constraints with indexing
Model model_name /all/;
Solve model_name minimizing y using mip;   \\ Solves the model using Mixed Integer Programming
Display x.l, y.l;  \\ Displays the solution values for the variables x and y
