! This is a GAMS code that solves a linear optimization problem.
$Title Linear Optimization Problem
Sets
      i   Supply regions /Region1, Region2, Region3, Region4, Region5/
      j   Demand regions /RegionA, RegionB, RegionC/
Parameters
      a(i)  Supply capacity of each region
      b(j)  Demand requirement of each region
      c(i,j)  Cost of transporting from ith supply region to jth demand region
Binary Variables
      x(i,j)  1 if the supply from ith region is sent to jth demand region, otherwise 0
Positive Variables
      z  Total cost of transportation
Equations
      Cost Definition
            Define the cost as:
            z =e= sum((i,j), c(i,j)*x(i,j));
      Supply Requirement
            Supply from each supply region must meet the requirement:
            sum(j, x(i,j)) =g= a(i) for all i;
      Demand Requirement
            Transportation to each demand region must meet the requirement:
            sum(i, x(i,j)) =e= b(j) for all j;
Model
      Optimize
