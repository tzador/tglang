     c(k,s)                      cost of transferring product from k to s
 
Variables
     x(t,i,k)                    amount of product i produced at period t in facility k
     y(t,i,k)                    binary variable indicating if product i is being produced at period t in facility k
     z(t,i,s)                    amount of product i stored at period t in facility s
     w(t,i,s)                    binary variable indicating if product i is being stored at period t in facility s
     cost                        total cost
 
Binary variables y and w are used to handle logical conditions and are declared as binary variables.
 
Positive variable x and z are used to represent production and storage quantities.
