* This is a GAMS code snippet that solves a linear optimization problem
* The problem consists of three variables, two constraints, and an objective function
* The variables will be defined as non-negative, and the objective function will be minimized
* The input data for the problem will be read from an external data file

* Define the three variables
variable x1, x2, x3;

* Define the objective function
minimize objFunction = 5*x1 + 10*x2 + 2*x3;

* Define the two constraints
* Constraint 1: x1 + 2*x2 + x3 >= 10
* Constraint 2: 5*x1 + x2 + 3*x3 <= 20
constraint cons1, cons2;

* Read input data from external data file
$call gdxxrw data.xlsx rng=data!a1:c3 lim=0 col=2 rng=param1 rng=param2 rng=param3 rng=rhs

* Define the constraints using the input data
cons1.. x1 + 2*x2 + x3 =g= param1;
cons2.. 5*x1 + x2 + 3*x3 =l= param2;

* Define non-negative variables
x1.lo = 0;
x2.lo = 0;
x3.lo = 0;

* Solve the problem
solve;

* Print the solution
display x1.l, x2.l, x3.l;

* Optional: save the results to an external file
$call gdxout results.gdx
$gdxout 'x1' = x1.l, 'x2' = x2.l, 'x3' = x3.l;
$gdxout 'objFunction' = objFunction.l;
$offlisting
execute_unload 'results.gdx';
