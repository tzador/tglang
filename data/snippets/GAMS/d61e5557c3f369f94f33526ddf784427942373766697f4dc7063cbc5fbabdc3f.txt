* This is a model for a production planning problem

Sets
    i   Set of plants
    j   Set of products ;

Parameters
    a(i)  Maximum production capacity of each plant
    b(j)  Market demand for each product
    c(i)  Cost of production at each plant
    p(j)  Price of each product ;

Variables
    x(i,j)  Amount of product j produced at plant i
    profit  Total profit ;

Equations
    obj_func  Objective function to maximize total profit
    cap_limit(i)  Maximum production capacity constraint for each plant
    demand_limit(j)  Market demand constraint for each product ;

* Define objective function and constraints

obj_func.. profit =e= sum(i, sum(j, p(j)*x(i,j))) - sum(i, a(i)*c(i));

cap_limit(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= a(i);

demand_limit(j).. sum(i, x(i,j)) =g= b(j);

* Solve the model and display results

Model prod_plan /all/;

solve prod_plan maximizing profit using lp;

display x.l, profit.l;
