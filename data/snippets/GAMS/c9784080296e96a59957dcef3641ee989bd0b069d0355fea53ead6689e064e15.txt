Sets
    i     customers         /c1*c30/    customers index to represent each customer
    j     stores            /s1*s50/    store index to represent each store
    p     products          /p1*p100/   product index to represent each product
    t     time              /t1*t12/    time index to represent each month

Parameters
    CP(i)                    customers' income
    TP(j)                    total products at each store
    DP(p)                    price for each product
    A                      spatial distance between customers and stores (input data)
    C(j)                    coordination cost among stores

Variables
    X(j,p)                  product quantity at each store
    Y(i,j,t)                product flow from store to customer each month
    Z(t)                    total cost of operation each month

Positive Variables
    X,Y,Z;

Equations
    transport(i,j,t)        define transportation equations
    operation(t)            calculate total operating cost
    income_constraint(i)    constraint on customers' income
    product_quantity(j,p)   constraint on total product quantity at each store;

transport(i,j,t).. Y(i,j,t) =e= sum(p, X(j,p));

operation(t).. Z(t) =e= sum(j, C(j)*X(j,p)+sum(i,Y(i,j,t)*DP(p)));

income_constraint(i).. sum(j, sum(p, DP(p)*X(j,p))) =l= CP(i);

product_quantity(j,p).. sum(i, Y(i,j,t)) =l= TP(j);
