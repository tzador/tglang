Binary Variables

x(i,t+1)$(ord(t) > 1) = sum(j, x(j,t) - r(i)*y(i,t)) =l= 0; % Defines x as the sum of previous x values minus r multiplied by y for each time period
y(i,t+1)$(ord(t) > 1) = x(i,t)*d(i) + y(i,t); % Defines y as the previous x value multiplied by d plus the previous y value for each time period

Positive Variables
    z 'total cost'
    w 'total demand'
    v 'total inventory'
    u(i,t) 'holding cost';

Equations
    obj 'objective function'
    tot_dem_def 'total demand definition'

    holding_cost_def 'holding cost definition';

obj.. z =e= sum((i,t), c(i)*x(i,t)) + sum((i,t), h(i)*u(i,t)); % Defines the objective function as the sum of c multiplied by x plus the sum of h multiplied by u for each city and time period
tot_dem_def.. w =e= sum(i, r(i)); % Defines total demand as the sum of r for all cities
tot_inv_def(i,t).. v =e= y(i,t); % Defines total inventory as y for each city and time period
tot_cost_def.. z =e= sum((i,t), c(i)*x(i,t)) + sum((i,t), h(i)*u(i,t)); % Defines total cost as the sum of c multiplied by x plus the sum of h multiplied by u for each city and time period
holding_cost_def(i,t).. u(i,t) =e= y(i,t)*d(i); % Defines holding cost as y multiplied by d for each city and time period

Model transportation /all/; % Creates a GAMS model named 'transportation' and applies it to all sets and variables specified

Solve transportation using lp minimizing z; % Solves the model using linear programming and minimizing the objective function 'z'

Display x.l, y.l, u.l; % Displays the optimal values for binary variables x, y, and holding cost

*Note: This code snippet solves a transportation problem, where a company must decide how much inventory to transport between cities over time in order to minimize costs and meet demand. The objective function maximizes profits by reducing transportation and holding costs, while ensuring enough inventory is available to meet demand.
