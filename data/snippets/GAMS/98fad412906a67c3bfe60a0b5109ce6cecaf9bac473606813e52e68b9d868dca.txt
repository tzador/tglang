* This is a sample GAMS code snippet

set i 'index set' /i1*i5/;
set j 'index set' /j1*j4/;

scalar a 'coefficient' /2/;
scalar b 'coefficient' /3/;
scalar c 'coefficient' /4/;
scalar d 'coefficient' /5/;

variable x(i,j);
equation obj, constr;
obj.. sum(i, sum(j, a*x(i,j) + b*x(i+1,j) + c*x(i,j+1) + d*x(i+1,j+1))) =e= 10;
constr.. sum(i, sum(j, x(i,j))) =l= 8;
model m /all/;
solve m using lp minimizing obj;
display x;

* This code creates an optimization model with a 2-dimensional variable x, 
* an objective function obj that minimizes the sum of coefficients multiplied by x 
* and a constraint constr that limits the sum of x values to be less than or equal to 8. 
* The model is then solved using linear programming and the values of x are displayed.
