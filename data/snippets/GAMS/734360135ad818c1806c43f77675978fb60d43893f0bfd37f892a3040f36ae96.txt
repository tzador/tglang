sets
    i   set of plants      / seattle, san-diego /
    j   set of end markets / new-york, chicago, topeka /;

parameters
    a(i)  capacity of plant i in cases
        /    seattle   350
           san-diego   600  /;

parameters
    b(j)  demand at market j in cases
        /    new-york   325
           chicago    300
           topeka      275  /;

table d(i,j)  distance in thousands of miles

san-diego       2.5           1.8          1.4;

variables
    x(i,j)  shipment quantities in cases
    z       total transportation costs in thousands of dollars;

positive variable x;

equations
    cost        define objective function
    supply(i)   observe supply limit at plant i
    demand(j)   satisfy demand at market j;

cost..        z =e= sum((i,j), d(i,j)*x(i,j));

supply(i)..   sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= a(i);

demand(j)..   sum(i, x(i,j)) =g= b(j);
