Sets
 i /1*3/ ;         "Set of variables from 1 to 3"
 
Parameters
 c(i) /1 5, 2 3, 3 2/ ;        "Coefficient of each variable"
 
Variables
 x(i) ;      "Decision variable"
 
Equations
 obj       "Objective function"
 cons1(i)  "Constraint 1"
 cons2(i)  "Constraint 2"
 
obj..     z =e= sum(i, c(i)*x(i)) ;   "Objective function z"
 
cons1(i).. sum(i, x(i)) =l= 10 ;      "Constraint 1: Sum of x(i) is less than or equal to 10"
cons2(i).. x(i) =l= 3 ;               "Constraint 2: x(i) is less than or equal to 3"
