$title Warehouse Location Problem

* sets
Sets
      i   warehouses / wh1*wh5 /
      j   customers  / c1*c15 /;

* parameters
Parameters
      a(i)    fixed cost of opening a warehouse
      b(i,j)  variable cost of serving customer j from warehouse i
      d(j)    demand of customer j
      q(i)    maximum capacity of a warehouse
      y(i)    binary variable if warehouse i is open
      x(i,j)  flow of product from warehouse i to customer j;

* variables
Binary variable
      y(i)   is warehouse i open?;

Positive variable
      x(i,j) amount shipped from warehouse i to customer j;

* objective function
Positive variables
      z      total cost of opening and shipping;
Equation
      obj    define objective function;
      cost   objective function;

      z =e= sum(i, a(i)*y(i)) + sum((i,j), b(i,j)*x(i,j));

      obj .. z =e=E=;

      cost .. z =e=E=;

Model Warehouse /all/ ;

* constraints
Equation
      capacity(i)      capacity constraint for warehouse i;
      demand(j)        meeting demand of customer j;
      warehouse_open   warehouse open if product is shipped;

capacity(i) .. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= q(i)*y(i);

demand(j) .. sum(i, x(i,j)) =e= d(j);

warehouse_open(i) .. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= q(i)*y(i);

option limrow = 10 , limcol = 10;

parameter c(i,j) 'shipping cost matrix';
scalar pi(i) 'warehouse shadow price';

c(i,j) = b(i,j) - pi(i);

pi(i) = y(i)$obj ;
