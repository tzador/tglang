Set
   i
   /1*10/
   j
   /1*20/;

Table a(i,j) Inventory levels at each location;

a(i,j) = 100;

Parameter
   d(i,j)     Demand at each location
   b(i)    Production limit at each location
;

Scalar
   t       Total cost;

Alias (i,j,ip,jp);

Variable
   z       total transportation cost
   x(i,j)  shipment quantities in optimal solution
   u(i)    dual variable representing production ceilings
   v(i,j)  dual variable representing transport constraints
   w(i,j)  dual variable representing objective function constraint;

Positive variable x;

Equation
   cost        define objective function
   supply(i)   observe supply limit at each plant
   demand(j)   satisfy demand at each market;

cost ..        z =e=  sum((i,j), a(i,j)*x(i,j));

supply(i) ..   sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= b(i);

demand(j) ..   sum(i, x(i,j)) =g= d(j);
