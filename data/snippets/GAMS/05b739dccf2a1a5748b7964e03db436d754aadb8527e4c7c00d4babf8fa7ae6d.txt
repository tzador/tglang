* Definition of Set I, J and K
Set i 'Demand regions' /NewYork, Chicago, LosAngeles/
    j 'Production facilities' /Detroit, Atlanta/
    k 'Raw material sources' /Pittsburgh, Houston/;
    
* Definition of Parameters
Parameters
    c(i,j) 'Variable cost of transporting one unit from demand region i to production facility j'
    a(j,k) 'Quantity of raw material k used at production facility j'
    b(i,j) 'Maximum units of demand that can be supplied by production facility j in region i';
    
* Definition of Variables
Variable
    x(i,j) 'Amount of units transported from demand region i to production facility j'
    z 'Total cost of transportation';
    
* Definition of Equations
Equation
    totcost 'Total cost of transportation'
    demand(i) 'Amount of demand met for demand region i';
    
* Optimization Model
Model transportation /all/;
* Objective Function
totcost.. z =e= sum((i,j), c(i,j)*x(i,j));
* Constraints
demand(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =e= b(i,j);
production(j).. sum(k, a(j,k)*x(i,j)) =l= b(i,j);
* Solve
Solve transportation using lp minimizing z;
* Display Results
Display x.l, totcost.l, demand.l;
