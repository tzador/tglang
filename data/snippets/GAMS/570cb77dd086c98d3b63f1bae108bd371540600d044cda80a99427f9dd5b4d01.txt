!This code snippet solves a transportation problem using GAMS
!The model minimizes the cost of transporting goods from factories to warehouses
Sets
    i = factories
    j = warehouses;

Parameters
    c(i,j) = cost of transporting one unit from factory to warehouse
    b(i) = supply capacity of each factory
    d(j) = demand requirement of each warehouse;

Variables
    x(i,j) = amount of goods transported from factory i to warehouse j;

Positive Variable x;

Equations
    costMinimize            !Objective function to minimize the cost
    supplyCapacity(i)       !Constraints to ensure supply capacity is not exceeded
    demandRequirement(j);   !Constraints to ensure demand requirement is met

costMinimize.. sum((i,j), c(i,j)*x(i,j)) =E= z;   !The cost of transportation is sum of costs for each route

supplyCapacity(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =L= b(i);      !Supply capacity constraint for factories

demandRequirement(j) .. sum(i, x(i,j)) =G= d(j);  !Demand requirement constraint for warehouses
