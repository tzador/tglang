Set i 'List of inputs' /i1*i100/;          # Defines a set of inputs from i1 to i100

Parameter a 'Constant value' /0.9/;         # Defines a constant value of 0.9 for parameter 'a'

Variables x(i) 'Decision variables';         # Declares an array of decision variables for each input in the set i

Free Variable obj;                          # Declares a free variable 'obj' that represents the objective function 

Equation constraint(i);                     # Declares an equation 'constraint' for each input in the set i

obj.. obj =e= sum(i, a*x(i));                 # Defines the objective function as the sum of 'a' multiplied by each decision variable in the set

constraint(i).. x(i) =l= 500;               # Sets a lower bound of 500 for each decision variable in the set i in the equation 'constraint'

Model model /all/;                           # Creates a model 'model' that includes all declared variables and equations

Solve model maximizing obj using lp;         # Solves the model by maximizing the objective function using the linear programming (lp) algorithm

Display x.l, obj.l;                         # Displays the optimal values of the decision variables and the objective function
