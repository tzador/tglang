Sets
       i products can be produced /p1*p10/,
       j time periods  /t1*t5/,
       k resources used  /r1*r3/ ;
Parameters 
       demand(j)         demand from each period,
       cost(i,k)         cost of producing each product with each resource,
       stock_start(i)    starting stock of each product,
       stock_end(i)      desired ending stock of each product,
       capacity(k)       maximum capacity for each resource ;
Variables 
       produce(i,j)      amount of each product made in each period,
       store(i,j)        amount of each product stored from previous period,
       usedup(i,k)       amount of each resource used for each product,
       total_profit;
Positive Variables produce, store ;

Equations
       proddef(i,j)      define the amount of each product made,
       stockdef(i,j)     ending stocks should equal desired stock amounts,
       maxcapacity(k)    total amount of each resource used cannot exceed capacity,
       produtil(i,j)     use up resources when producing a product,
       profitobj         maximize total profit ;

proddef(i,j)..       produce(i,j) =e= demand(j) ;

stockdef(i,j)..      store(i,j) =e= store(i,j-1) + produce(i,j) - demand(j) ;

maxcapacity(k)..     sum(i, usedup(i,k)) =l= capacity(k) ;

produtil(i,j)..      sum(k, usedup(i,k)) =e= cost(i,k)*produce(i,j) ;

profitobj..          total_profit =e= sum((i,j), produce(i,j)*
                      (sum(k, cost(i,k)) - demand(j))) ;
