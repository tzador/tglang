Sets
    i       some index
    j       another index;
Parameters
    c(i)        cost for each index
    A(i,j)      coefficient for each index
    b(i)        RHS for each index
    x0(i)       initial guess for variable;
Variables
    x(i)        decision variable
    z           objective function;
Equations
    BudgetConstraint,              Constraint equation for budget
        TotalCost,                  Objective function equation;
BudgetConstraint..
    Sum(i, c(i) * x(i)) =l= B;       total cost of all variables is less than or equal to budget, B, value.
TotalCost..
    z =e= Sum(i, c(i) * x(i));         Objective function is equal to sum of cost multiplied by decision variable x(i).
