$Title Capacity Expansion Model for Electric Vehicles
$Ontext
This model determines the optimal number of electric vehicles
to produce in a given year, taking into account production costs
and consumer demand.

Sets
   i    set of electric vehicle types /sedan, suv, truck/
   t    set of years /2021*2030/;
   
Parameters
   gamma(i,t)   investment costs for each vehicle type and year (in thousands of dollars)
   delta(i,t)   market demand for each vehicle type and year (in units)
   rho(i)       discount rate for each vehicle type (in decimal)
   
Variable
   x(i,t) "number of vehicles produced"
   z        "total production cost";

Equations
   obj       objective function
   demand(i,t)   satisfies market demand
   production    ensures production equals number of vehicles produced
   
obj.. z =e= sum((i,t), gamma(i,t)*x(i,t)); 
demand(i,t).. x(i,t) =l= delta(i,t); 
production.. sum(i, x(i,t)) =e= sum(i, delta(i,t));
