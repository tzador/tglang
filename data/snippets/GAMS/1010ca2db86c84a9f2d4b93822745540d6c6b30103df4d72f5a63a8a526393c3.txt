$TITLE Optimal R&D Investment with Two Projects
$ONTEXT
The model involves deciding optimal levels of research and development (R&D) investment for two projects, while considering budget and time constraints.

SETS
i "projects" /p1*p2/;

PARAMETERS
b "total budget available" /500/
l "total time available" /2000/
c(i) "cost of R&D for each project" /p1 100, p2 150/
t(i) "time required for R&D for each project" /p1 500, p2 1000/
r(i) "expected return from each project" /p1 300, p2 600/;

VARIABLES
x(i) "level of R&D investment for each project"
z "total expected return";

POSITIVE VARIABLE x;

EQUATIONS
budget "budget constraint"
time "time constraint"
obj "objective function";

obj.. z =E= SUM(i, r(i)*x(i));

budget.. SUM(i, c(i)*x(i)) =L= b;

time.. SUM(i, t(i)*x(i)) =L= l;
