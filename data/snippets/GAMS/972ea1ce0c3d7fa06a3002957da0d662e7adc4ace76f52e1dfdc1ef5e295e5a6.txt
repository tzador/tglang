# This code creates a model called "production" that maximizes profit
# with constraints on resources and production capacity

      plant10.p5 13                       # annotation: plant10 can produce a maximum of 13 units of product p5
   b(j) 'product demand' /                # annotation: defines the demand for each product
      p1 25                               # annotation: demand for product p1 is 25 units
      p2 30                               # annotation: demand for product p2 is 30 units
      p3 20                               # annotation: demand for product p3 is 20 units
      p4 35                               # annotation: demand for product p4 is 35 units
      p5 15;                              # annotation: demand for product p5 is 15 units

Variables
   x(i,j) 'production level'              # annotation: defines the amount of each product to be produced by each plant
   z 'total profit'                       # annotation: objective variable, represents total profit

Positive Variable x;

Equations
   cost 'total production cost'           # annotation: defines the total production cost based on product demand and production levels
   demand(j) 'product demand'             # annotation: ensures that the product demand is met by production levels

cost .. z =e= sum(i, j, c*x(i,j));        # annotation: objective function, calculates total profit given production levels
demand(j) .. sum(i, x(i,j)) =e= b(j);     # annotation: constraint, ensures that product demand is met by production levels
                                                  

Model production /all/;

Solve production maximizing z using lp;    # annotation: solves the model "production" by maximizing total profit
