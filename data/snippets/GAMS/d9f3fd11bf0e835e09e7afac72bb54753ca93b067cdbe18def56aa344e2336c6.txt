Sets
   i   Customers / NY, CH, LA, ATL, SEA /
   j   Plants / A, B, C, D /
   d(i,j) Distance in miles
   ;
   
Loop(i, j,
   d(i,j) = 100;
);

Positive Variables
   x(i,j) Amount shipped;

Equations
   Cost          Objective function
   Supply(i)     Plant capacities
   Demand(j)     Customer requirements;

Cost..          z =e= sum((i,j), c(i,j)*x(i,j));
Supply(i)..     sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= a(i);
Demand(j)..     sum(i, x(i,j)) =g= b(j);

Model transportation /all/;

Solve transportation using lp minimizing z;
