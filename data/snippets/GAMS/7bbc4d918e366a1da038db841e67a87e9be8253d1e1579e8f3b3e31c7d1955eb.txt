$TITLE "Transportation Problem"
Sets
    i "plants"
    j "markets"
Parameters
    c(i,j) "cost per unit"
    a(i) "plant capacity"
    b(j) "market demand"
Variables
    x(i,j) "shipment quantities in cases"
    z "total transportation costs in thousands of dollars"
Positive Variables x
Equations
    cost "define objective function"
    supply(i) "observe supply limit"
    demand(j) "satisfy demand"
cost..      z =e= sum((i,j), c(i,j)*x(i,j));
supply(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= a(i);
demand(j).. sum(i, x(i,j)) =g= b(j);
Model transport /all/;
Solve transport using lp minimizing z;
