Sets
    i 'set of locations'
    j 'set of customers'
    k 'set of markets';

Parameters
    d(i,j) 'distance from locations to customers'
    p(k) 'price of products in each market';

Variables
    x(i,j,k) 'quantity of products shipped from locations to customers in each market'
    c(k) 'total cost in each market';

Positive Variable x;

Equations
    objective 'total cost'
    supply(i,k) 'supply at each location must be greater than or equal to demand'
    demand(j,k) 'demand at each customer must be met';

objective.. c(k) =e= sum((i,j,k), p(k)*d(i,j)*x(i,j,k));
supply(i,k).. sum(j, x(i,j,k)) =g= demand(j,k);
demand(j,k).. sum(i, x(i,j,k)) =e= b(j,k);
