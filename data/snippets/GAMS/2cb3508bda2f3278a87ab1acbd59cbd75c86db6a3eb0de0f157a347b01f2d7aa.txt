* Example of GAMS code for solving a simple sports matchup optimization problem.
* In this problem, we want to maximize the total number of wins for each team
* while taking into account the power of each team and the winning chances against each opponent.

* Sets declaration, i is the set of teams and j is the set of opponents.
Sets
   i     'team' /Netherlands, Germany, France/
   j     'opponent' /Italy, England, Spain/  ;

* Parameters declaration, w represents the team power and c represents the winning chances for each matchup.

Variables
   x(i,j) 'binary variable' ;  * Binary variable representing whether a team wins against an opponent.
Binary Variables x ;  * Define the set of binary variables.

* Equation declaration, wins calculates the total number of wins for each team and obj is the objective function to maximize.
Equation
   wins(i)    'total number of wins'
   obj        'maximize total number of wins' ;

* Constraints and objective function.
wins(i)..     sum(j, x(i,j)) =e= w(i) ;  * The total number of wins for a team is equal to its power.
obj..         z =e= sum(i, wins(i)) ;  * Maximize the total number of wins for all teams.

* Note: The objective function could also be written as:
* obj..  z =e= sum((i,j), c(i,j)*x(i,j)) ;
* This would take into account the winning chances for each matchup instead of just the team power.
