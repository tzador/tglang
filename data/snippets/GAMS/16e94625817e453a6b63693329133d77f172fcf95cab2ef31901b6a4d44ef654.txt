SETS 
  i    'index for pizza types'   /p1*p10/ ,
  j    'index for toppings'      /t1*t5/  ,
  k    'index for sizes'         /s1*s3/  ;
 
PARAMETERS 
  price(i)    'price of each pizza type in dollars'
  /p1 15,	p2 17,	p3 12,	p4 8,	p5 25,	p6 22,	p7 20,	p8 13,	p9 11,	p10 18/,
 
  calories(i)  'calories per slice'
  /p1 300,	p2 350,	p3 270,	p4 200,	p5 400,	p6 450,	p7 380,	p8 250,	p9 320,	p10 380/,
 
  extra(j)    'price of each extra topping in dollars'
  /t1 1.50,	t2 1.75,	t3 2.00,	t4 1.25,	t5 2.50/;
 
VARIABLES 
  x(i,j)     'amount of each topping on each pizza'
  y(i,k)     'number of each size of pizza ordered';

EQUATIONS 
  cost(i)    'total cost for each pizza type'
  size(i,k)  'constraint on number of each size ordered'
  total      'total cost of all pizzas';
 
cost(i)..
  price(i) =e= sum(j, extra(j)*x(i,j));      *** equation to calculate total cost for each pizza type, using the price and amount of toppings ***
 
size(i,k)..
  sum(k, y(i,k)) =l= 5;                      *** constraint to limit the number of pizzas per size to 5 ***

total..
  sum(i, cost(i)*y(i,k)) =e= sum(i, sum(j, extra(j)*x(i,j)));     *** equation to calculate total cost of all pizzas, using the cost and amount of toppings for each pizza type ***
 
MODEL pizza /all/;         *** create a model named 'pizza' that includes all sets, parameters, variables, and equations ***
 
SOLVE pizza using lp maximizing total;      *** solve the model using linear programming, maximizing the total cost of all pizzas ***
 
DISPLAY x, y, cost, size;       *** display the values for the variables and equations in the model ***
