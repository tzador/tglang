Variables
  x(i,j)     Decision variable definition
  u(i)       Intermediate variable
  c(i,j)     Cost coefficient
  a(i,j)     Constraint coefficient matrix
  d          Demand constraint value
  b(i)       Supply constraint value

Positive Variable u;

Equations
  Cost(i,j)  Objective function
  Supply(i)  Supply constraint
  Demand     Demand constraint
  Balance    Balance constraint;

Cost(i, j)..
  c(i,j) * x(i,j) =l= z;        \* Sets the cost variable i,j multiplied by the decision variable x(i,j) equal to less than or equal to z

Supply(i)..
  sum(j, a(i,j) * x(i,j)) =l= b(i) + u(i);        \* Sets the sum of constraint coefficient a(i,j) multiplied by decision variable x(i,j) equal to less than or equal to b(i) plus intermediate variable u(i)

Demand..
  sum(i, x(i,j)) =g= d;        \* Sets the sum of decision variable x(i,j) greater than or equal to demand constraint value d

Balance..
  sum(i,j, a(i,j) * x(i,j)) =e= sum(i, b(i));        \* Sets the sum of constraint coefficient a(i,j) multiplied by decision variable x(i,j) equal to the sum of supply constraint b(i)
