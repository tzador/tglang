*An example of a mixed-integer programming model for production planning
sets
	Products /p1, p2, p3/;  					*set of products
Parameters
	ProdCap(Products) /p1 200, p2 150, p3 300/;  	*production capacity for each product
Variables
	x(Products) Binary;  						*decision variable for product production
	s(Products) Positive;						*slack variable to handle production constraints
	e(Products) Economic Scale;					*economies of scale variable
Equations
	ProductionCap(Products):						*production capacity constraint
		sum(Products, x(Products)) =e= ProdCap(Products);
	TotalProduction: 							*total production equation
		sum(Products, e(Products)*x(Products)) =e= objective function;
	
Model Production /all/;							*define the optimization model
solve Production using MIP minimizing TotalProduction;	*solve using mixed-integer programming
