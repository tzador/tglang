*This code snippet solves a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) using GAMS
Set i 'Manufacturing plants' /p1*p5/;  *Sets are used to define groups of elementary elements
Alias(i,j);

Parameter
  d 'Demand value at each plant' /p1 0, p2 10, p3 20, p4 8, p5 15/;

Parameter
  c(i) 'Unit cost at each plant' /p1 100, p2 150, p3 200, p4 130, p5 180/;

Variables
  x(i) 'Amount produced at each plant' integer;   *Integer variables are used for binary or discrete decision variables
  y(i) 'Binary variable indicating if plant is open';
  
Binary variable y(i);

Positive variable s 'Shipment costs';  *Positive variables are used for continuous decision variables

Equations
  obj 'Objective function: minimize cost'
  balance(i) 'Balance constraint at each plant';

obj.. s =e= sum(i, c(i)*x(i)) + sum(i, 500*y(i));  *Objective function to minimize total costs, with additional cost for opening a plant
 
balance(i).. x(i) - s =e= d(i);  *Balance constraint to ensure demand is met
 
Model m /all/;   *Model statement defines the problem and all associated elements
 
m.nd = 2;  *Sets the number of integer variables
 
Solve m using MIP min s;  *Solve the MILP and minimize the shipment costs
 
Display x.l, y.l, s.l;  *Display the optimal values for the decision variables and objective function
