/* 
Explanation:
- Sets: defines two sets, 'i' and 'j', both ranging from 1 to 10.
- Alias: creates an alias for the sets 'i' and 'j'.
- Variables: creates three variables 'x', 'y', and 'z' with indices 'i' and 'j', and a binary variable 'z'.
- Equations: defines five equations, one for the objective function, two for the constraints on 'x' and 'y', one for the constraint on 'z', and one for an additional constraint.
- Model: creates a model named 'testmodel' containing all sets, variables, and equations.
- Solve: solves the model 'testmodel' using linear programming and maximizing the objective function.
- Display: displays the optimal values of 'x', 'y', and 'z'.
