This code snippet is written in GAMS, a high-level modeling language used in mathematical programming. The code is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem, specifically a mixed integer linear program (MILP).

In this model, we have a set of investment projects, each with a net present value (NPV) and a budget constraint. The goal is to maximize the total NPV subject to the constraint. We also want to make sure that at least 50% of the total budget is invested in green projects, which have a higher NPV but also a higher cost.

The code starts by declaring the sets, parameters, and variables. Then the objective function and constraints are defined. Finally, the model is solved and the results are displayed.

Sets
    i   investment projects
    j   type of project (1 = green, 2 = non-green)
    
Parameters
    NPV(i)  net present value of each project
    Budget  total budget
    
Variables
    x(i)    binary variable indicating whether a project is chosen or not
    y       fraction of budget invested in green projects
    
Binary variable x is formulated as a decision variable, taking the value 1 if the project is chosen and 0 otherwise. The variable y represents the ratio of budget invested in green projects.

Maximize objective function
    maximize Total_NPV:
        sum(i, NPV(i) * x(i)); // maximizing total NPV
    
Subject to budget constraint
    /* make sure total budget is not exceeded */
    subject to Total_Budget:
        sum(i, x(i)) <= Budget;
        
Constraint for green investments
    /* ensure at least 50% of budget is invested in green projects */
    subject to Green_Budget:
        sum(i$(j(i)=1), x(i)) >= y * Budget;
        
Solve model
    /* solve the optimization problem */
    solve;

Display results
    /* display the total NPV and budget allocated to green projects */
    display Total_NPV, y * Budget;
