Sets
    i       Set of raw materials
            / wood, plastic, paint /
    j       Set of products
            / car, doll, ball /;

Parameters
    a(i)    Cost of each raw material
            / wood  12,  plastic 15, paint 5 /
    b(j)    Demand for each product
            / car 100, doll 150, ball 200 /;

Table c(i,j)  Cost of producing each product using each material
              car         doll          ball
wood        8           5               10
plastic     10          4               6
paint       2           3               1;

Variables
    x(i,j)      Amount of each material used to produce each product
    profit      Total profit of manufacturing company;

Positive Variables x;

Equations
    cost(i,j)    Total cost of each product
    demand(j)    Meet the demand for each product
    total_profit Total profit for the company;

cost(i,j)..    sum(i, x(i,j)*c(i,j)) =e= a(i);
demand(j)..    sum(i, x(i,j)) =g= b(j);
total_profit.. profit =e= sum(i,j, x(i,j)*c(i,j));
