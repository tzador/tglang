* This GAMS code snippet creates a mathematical model for a production planning problem.
* This model maximizes profit while taking into account production capacity and market demand constraints.

Set i 'Products'
    /p1*p3/;  # Defining production items

Alias(p,i);   # Creating an alias for the products set

Set j 'Plants'
    /a1*a3/;  # Defining production plants

Alias (a,j);  # Creating an alias for the plants set

Parameter
    capacity(i) 'Production capacity for each product'
    demand(i) 'Market demand for each product';   # Defining capacity and demand parameters for products

capacity(i) = 100, 150, 200;   # Setting values for the capacity parameter
demand(i) = 80, 100, 120;      # Setting values for the demand parameter

Variable
    x(i,j) 'Amount of product i produced at plant j'
    profit      'Total profit';   # Defining decision variables

Positive Variable x;    # Setting x as a positive variable

Equation
    production(i) 'Production capacity constraint for each product'
    demand(i) 'Market demand constraint for each product'
    profit_eq 'Objective function';    # Defining equations

production(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= capacity(i);    # Production constraint for each product
demand(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =g= demand(i);          # Market demand constraint for each product
profit_eq.. profit =e= sum((i,j), x(i,j)*profit(i,j));    # Objective function to maximize profit

Model production_planning /all/;    # Defining the name of the model

Solve production_planning using lp maximizing profit;    # Solving the model
