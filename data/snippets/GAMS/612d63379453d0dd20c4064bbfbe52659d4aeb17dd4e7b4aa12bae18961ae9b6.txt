Sets
    i    Set of customers;
    j    Set of products;
Parameters
    t(i,j)    Average time spent per product for each customer, in minutes;
    m(i,j)    Demand of each product for each customer;
    p(j)      Price of each product;
    d(i)      Maximum time available for each customer, in minutes;
    b(j)      Maximum budget for each product;

Variables
    x(i,j)    Amount of each product to be purchased by each customer;
    profit    Total profit earned from product sales;

Binary Variables
    y(i,j)    Binary variable to indicate if product was purchased by customer;

Positive Variable
    z         Variable to calculate total time spent by each customer;

Equations
    profit_eq(i,j)  Equation to calculate profit = sum of (demand * price * binary variable);
    budget_eq(j)    Equation to ensure total cost of products purchased does not exceed budget;
    time_eq(i)      Equation to ensure total time spent by each customer does not exceed maximum available time;

Model
