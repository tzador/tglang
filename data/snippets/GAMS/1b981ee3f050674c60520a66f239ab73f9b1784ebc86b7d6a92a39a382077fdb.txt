Variables 
    x "Production of product 1",
    y "Production of product 2",
    z "Production of product 3";

Positive Variables x,y,z;

Equations
    Prod1 "Total production of product 1",
    Prod2 "Total production of product 2",
    Prod3 "Total production of product 3",
    MinPrice "Minimum total price";

Prod1.. x =e= 100;
Prod2.. y =e= 150;
Prod3.. z =e= 200;

MinPrice.. 6*x + 8*y + 10*z =e= 2000;

Model problem /all/;
