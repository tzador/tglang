* Sample GAMS code
SETS
i  nodes   /1*5/
j  compressors   /1*3/
k  pipelines   /1*7/;

PARAMETERS
cMax(i,j)  maximum compressor capacity in million cubic feet per day
/1  3, 2 2, 3 3/
cMin(i,j)  minimum compressor capacity (default set to 0)
pTrans(i,k)  charge rate for transportation between nodes
/1  2.5, 1, 1.5 2.5, 2.5 3.5, 1.5 5/
pHold(k)  storage rate for pipelines
;

VARIABLES
f(i,j)  flow on pipelines between nodes
c(j)  compressor capacity used
obj  total cost of operation;

POSITIVE VARIABLES
f
c;

EQUATIONS
FLOWSUM(i)  sum of inflows and outflows;
CAPACITY(j)  maximum and minimum compressor capacity;
RATE(i,k)  charge rate for transportation and storage;
TOTALCOST  total cost of operation;

FLOWSUM(i)..
  f(i,"in") + f(i,"out") =E= sum(k, pTrans(i,k));

CAPACITY(j)..
  cMin(j) =L= c(j) =L= cMax(j);

RATE(i,k)..
  f(i,k) =E= pTrans(i,k) + sum(j, pHold(k) * c(j));

TOTALCOST..
  obj =E= sum(j, c(j));
