Sets
- used to define indexes or categories for variables and parameters, such as plants, markets, and time periods in this code
Parameters
- used to define values for variables and constraints, such as production capacity, demand, shipping costs, and production costs in this code
Variables
- used to represent unknown quantities that can be manipulated in the model, such as the amount of production allocated to each market for each plant in each time period in this code
Positive Variables
- used to restrict the values of the variables to non-negative values, as production and demand cannot be negative in this context
Equations
- used to define relationships between variables and parameters, such as the total production must equal the demand, the variable production costs must be less than or equal to the total production costs, the fixed production costs must be greater than or equal to the total fixed production costs, the shipping costs must be greater than or equal to the total shipping costs, and the production allocation must be greater than or equal to zero in this code
Model
- used to name the model and specify the solver to use for optimization
Solve
- used to solve the model using the specified solver and optimization method
display
- used to print the results of the optimization, such as the total production costs, the values of the variables, their lower and upper limits, and their margins in this code
