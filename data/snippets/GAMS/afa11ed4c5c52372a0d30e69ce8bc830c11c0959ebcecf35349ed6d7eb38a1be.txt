Parameters
   Cost     Total cost of building plants and transportation (euro)
   x.l      Units of production (MW)
   y.l      Plant capacity installed (MW)
   z.l1(*)  Units shipped from plant 1 to market
   z.l2(*)  Units shipped from plant 2 to market
   z.l3(*)  Units shipped from plant 3 to market
   z.l4(*)  Units shipped from plant 4 to market
   z.l5(*)  Units shipped from plant 5 to market;

* This code snippet solves a transportation and production planning problem for a company that has 5 plants and 5 markets.
* The company wants to minimize the total cost of building plants and transporting units from the plants to the markets.
* The variables x, y, and z represent the units of production, plant capacity installed, and units shipped from plants to markets, respectively.
* The objective function calculates the total cost by multiplying the cost of building each plant by the plant capacity installed and the transportation cost per unit from each plant to each market.
* The constraints ensure that the total units shipped from each plant to each market is greater than or equal to the demand at that market.
* The code then displays and solves the problem, providing the optimal values for the variables and the total cost.
