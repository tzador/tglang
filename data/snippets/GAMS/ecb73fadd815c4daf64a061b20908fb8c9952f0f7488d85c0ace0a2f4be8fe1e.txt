Variable

x(i)  \\ fraction of total assets allocated to asset i
 
Positive variable indicating the fraction of total assets allocated to asset i in the portfolio 

Equation

xsum(i)  \\ sum of all asset fractions 
xsum(i)$i..sum(x(i))=e=1; \\ equation constraint to ensure that the sum of all asset fractions is equal to one 

Positive variable indicating the total return of the portfolio 

Scalar

rettot /0/; \\ scalar to hold the total return of the portfolio 

Equation

ret(i) \\ return for asset i 
rettot(i)$i..rettot=sum(i,x(i)*Productivity(i,j)); \\ equation constraint to calculate the total return of the portfolio based on the productivity of each asset in each market 

Variable

r;  \\ risk variable 

Equation

riskdef(i,j) the risk of investing in asset i in market j 

Scalar

risktot(j); \\ scalar to hold the total risk of each market 

Equation

risk(j) \\ calculate the total risk of each market 
risk(j)..risktot(j)=e=1/(sqrt(sum(i,x(i)*(Productivity(i,j)-re(i)*Productivity(i,j)+re(i))))**2; \\ equation constraint to calculate the total risk of each market based on the return error term 

Equation

riskcon(i) \\ risk content constraint 
riskcon(i)$i..sum(j,riskdef(i,j))=e=.5; \\ equation constraint to ensure that the total risk for each asset is equal to 0.5 

Equation

xi(i) \\ excess return constraint 
xi(i)$i..ret(i)-riskcon(i)=e=0; \\ equation constraint to ensure that the excess return for each asset is equal to 0 

Equation

obj \\ objective function 
obj..rr=sqrsum(i,ret(i)-riskcon(i)); \\ equation to minimize risk while maximizing return 

Model 

portfolio /all/; \\ defining the model name 

Solve 

portfolio using MIP maximizing obj; \\ solving the model using mixed integer programming
