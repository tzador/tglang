Sets
    i "Producers"
    j "Consumers";
Parameters
    a(i) "Fixed costs for each producer"
    b(i,j) "Production costs for each producer and consumer"
    p(j) "Consumer demands";
Variables
    x(i,j) "Total production of each producer for each consumer"
    z "Total cost";
Binary Variables
    y(i) "Binary variable indicating if producer i is selected or not";
Equations
    Objective "Objective function to minimize total cost"
    TotalCost "Calculate total cost based on production and fixed costs"
    Demand "Ensure that consumer demands are met"
    SelectProducer "Limit producer selection to one per consumer";
