set i "index"

Set j "second index"
Variable x(i,j) "decision variable"
Equation obj "objective function"

obj.. sum((i,j), x(i,j)) =e= 10; "sum of all decision variables must equal 10"

Equations c1(i) "constraint 1"
c1(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= 5; "sum of decision variables in each row must be less than or equal to 5"

Equations c2(j) "constraint 2"
c2(j).. sum(i, x(i,j)^2) =g= 20; "sum of squares of decision variables in each column must be greater than or equal to 20"

Model m /all/; "define model with all sets, variables, and equations"

Solve m using lp minimizing obj; "solve model using linear programming with objective to minimize the objective function"
