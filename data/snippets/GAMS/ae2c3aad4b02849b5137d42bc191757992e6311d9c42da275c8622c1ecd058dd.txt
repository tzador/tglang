$ONTEXT
The transportation problem seeks to minimize the cost of shipping
goods from a set of origins to a set of destinations. The solution
technique requires that all the indices in the sets i and j be
assigned to dummy sets using the $ONTEXT command.
$OFFTEXT

VARIABLES

       x(i,j)  shipment quantities in cases
       z       total transportation costs in thousands of dollars ;

POSITIVE VARIABLE x ;

EQUATIONS
