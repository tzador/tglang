Scalar f  'freight in dollars per case per thousand miles'  /90/;
              *** Note: Scalar is used for single variable

Parameter c(i,j) 'transport cost in thousands of dollars per case' ;

c(i,j) = f * d(i,j) / 1000 ;
              *** Note: Parameter c(i,j) is defined as the product of
                        scalar f and table d divided by 1000

Scalar z 'total transportation costs in thousands of dollars' ;

Variable x(i,j) 'shipment quantities in cases';
          
Positive Variable x ;

Equation
       cost        define objective function
       supply(i)   observe supply limit at plant i
       demand(j)   satisfy demand at market j ;

Cost ..        z  =e=  sum((i,j), c(i,j)*x(i,j)) ;
              *** Note: Objective function z is the sum of all 
                        transportation costs (c(i,j) multiplied by
                        decision variable x(i,j))

Supply(i) ..   sum(j, x(i,j))  =l=  a(i) ;
              *** Note: Supply limit at plant i is set to be less
                        than or equal to capacity a(i)

Demand(j) ..   sum(i, x(i,j))  =g=  b(j) ;
              *** Note: Satisfaction of demand at market j is set 
                        to be greater than or equal to demand b(j)

Model transport /all/ ; 
              *** Note: Model named 'transport' includes all 
                        defined equations and variables

Solve transport using lp minimizing z ; 
              *** Note: Solves the model using linear programming
                        and minimizes the objective function z.
