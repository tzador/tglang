* This is a GAMS code snippet for solving a capacitated facility location problem
* Parameters: m = number of facilities, n = number of customers, K = total capacity
* c(i,j) = distance between facility i and customer j
* d(i) = demand of customer i
* x(i,j) = 1 if customer j is assigned to facility i, 0 otherwise
* y(i) = 1 if facility i is opened, 0 otherwise
