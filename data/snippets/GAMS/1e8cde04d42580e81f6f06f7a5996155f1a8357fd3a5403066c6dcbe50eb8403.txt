*declare sets
Set i   'plants'
    j   'markets';

*declare parameters
Parameter
    a(i)    'capacity of plant i'
    b(j)    'demand at market j'
    d(i,j)  'distance between plant i and market j';
    
*declare variables
Variables
    x(i,j)  'amount shipped from plant i to market j';

*declare equations
Equations
    obj       'define objective function'
    supply(i) 'ensure supply constraint at plant i'
    demand(j) 'meet demand constraint at market j';

*objective function
obj..     z =e= sum((i,j), d(i,j)*x(i,j));
    
*supply constraint
supply(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =l= a(i);

*demand constraint
demand(j).. sum(i, x(i,j)) =g= b(j);

*solve the model
Model mcp /all/;
Solve mcp using lp Minimizing z;

*display results
Display x, z;
