* This is a complex production model

$TITLE Production Model

SETS
i       Raw material sources    / r1*r3 /
j       Production units        / u1*u4 /
k       Finished products       / p1*p3 / ;

ALIAS (i,j), (k,j), (k,i), (i,j,k);

PARAMETERS
ad(i)    Amount of raw materials provided by source i
tp(j)    Production time per unit of unit j
cc(j)    Production cost per unit of unit j ;

ad(i)     = 200, 100, 150;
tp(j)     = 1, 0.8, 1.2, 0.9;
cc(j)     = 20, 30, 40, 25;

VARIABLES
ced(i,k)   Amount of raw materials consumed by product k from source i
pru(j)     Production units used
prod(k)    Total production of product k
totcost    Total production cost ;

EQUATIONS
bal(i)      Balance of raw material from source i
prodbal(k)  Balance of finished product k
costbal(j)  Balance of production cost for unit j ;

bal(i)..                                    ad(i) =e= sum(k, ced(i,k));

prodbal(k)..                                sum(i, ced(i,k)) =e= prod(k);

costbal(j)..                                cc(j)*pru(j) =e= totcost;
