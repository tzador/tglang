! A GAMS code that solves a multi-period production planning problem

Sets
    i /i1*i3/     ! set of production plants
    t /t1*t6/     ! set of time periods
    j(t) /t1*i1,t2*i1,t3*i1,t3*i2,t5*i2,t6*i2,t4*i3,t5*i3,t6*i3/    ! set of possible production routes

Parameters
    c(i)       ! production cost per period
    /i1 100, i2 150, i3 200/
    d(t)       ! demand for product in each time period
    /t1 50, t2 100, t3 150, t4 200, t5 250, t6 300/
    M          ! large number to represent infinity
    /M 100000/

Variables
    x(j)       ! amount produced for each route
    z          ! total cost of production

Positive Variable x;

Equations
    cost        ! definition of total cost equation
    demand(t)   ! demand constraint for each period
    maxprod(i)  ! limit on maximum production for each plant

cost.. z =e= sum(j, c(j)*x(j));                    ! total cost equation

demand(t).. sum(j(t), x(j)) =l= d(t);              ! demand constraint for each period

maxprod(i).. sum(t(j), x(j)) =l= M;                ! maximum production constraint for each plant

Model multi_period /cost, demand, maxprod/;
