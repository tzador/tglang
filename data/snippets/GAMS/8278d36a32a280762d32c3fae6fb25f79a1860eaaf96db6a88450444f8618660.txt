$Title Complex Model;

Sets
   i  cities   / tampa, newyork, chicago, dallas /  index for cities
   j  plants   / j1*j5 /  index for plants
   k  products / cheese, bread, yogurt, milk /  index for products;

Parameters

   iDC(i)     DC in each city
   iState(i)  state where each city belongs to
   C(i)       cost of distribution in each city
   c(j)       fixed cost of building a plant
   v(k)       variable cost of producing each product
   q(j,k)     maximum plant capacity
   A(i,j)     transportation cost from each city to each plant
   b(i,k)     maximum demand for each product in each city
   d(i,j,k)   distance between each city and plant for each product;

* Sets and parameters above are typically defined elsewhere in the code

Variables
   x(j)       plant location decision variables
   y(k)       product production decision variables
   p(i,j,k)   transportation decision variables
   w(i,j,k)   inventory decision variables
   profit     total profit;

Binary variables x, y;

Equations
   totalcost         define total costs
   objective         maximize profits
   plantcapacity(j)  plant capacity requirements
   distribution(i)   distribution constraints
   demand(i,k)       demand constraints
   inventory(i,j,k)  inventory constraints;

* Define total costs equation
totalcost..  P =E= SUM((i,j,k), (A(i,j)+C(i))*d(i,j,k)*p(i,j,k)
                   + c(j)*x(j)
                   + v(k)*y(k)
                   + C(i)*w(i,j,k) );

* Define plant capacity constraints
plantcapacity(j).. SUM((i,k), p(i,j,k)) =L= 0;

* Define distribution constraints
distribution(i).. SUM((j,k), p(i,j,k)) + iDC(i) =E= SUM((j,k), A(i,j)*p(i,j,k));

* Define demand constraints
demand(i,k).. SUM((j,k), A(i,j)*p(i,j,k)) + w(i,j,k) =E= b(i,k);

* Define inventory constraints
inventory(i,j,k).. w(i,j,k) =E= q(j,k) - p(i,j,k);


* Define objective function (maximize total profits)
objective.. profit =E= SUM((j,k),  (b(i,k)*w(i,j,k) - (A(i,j)+C(i))*d(i,j,k)*p(i,j,k) - c(j)*x(j) - v(k)*y(k) - C(i)*w(i,j,k));
