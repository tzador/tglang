Set
    i 'Index for node i' /1*5/
    j 'Index for node j' /1*5/;

Parameters
    c(i,j) 'Unit cost of shipping from node i to node j';

$Title Unit Cost Model

$Ontext
    This model determines the minimum cost for shipping goods between nodes i and j.
$Offtext

Scalar
    cost 'Total cost of shipping';

Variables
    x(i,j) 'Binary variable for shipping from node i to j'
    totalcost 'Sum of shipping costs';

Binary Variable x;
Equations
    obj 'Objective function for minimizing total cost'
    flow(i) 'Outflow of goods from node i'
    balance 'Flow balance between nodes';

obj.. totalcost =e= sum((i,j), c(i,j)*x(i,j));
flow(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =e= 1;
balance.. sum(j, x(i,j)) - sum(j, x(j,i)) =e= 0;
