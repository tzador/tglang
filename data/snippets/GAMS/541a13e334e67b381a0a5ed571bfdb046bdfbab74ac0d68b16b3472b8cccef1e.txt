* This is a linear programming problem using GAMS

* Declare variables
VARIABLES
    x "Number of product X"
    y "Number of product Y"
    z "Number of product Z"
;

* Declare objective function
EQUATIONS
    obj "Objective function"
;

* Objective function: maximize profit
obj.. z =E= 10*x + 15*y + 8*z;

* Declare constraints
EQUATIONS
    con1 "Constraint 1"
    con2 "Constraint 2"
    con3 "Constraint 3"
;

* Constraint 1: production capacity for X
con1.. x =L= 100;

* Constraint 2: production capacity for Y
con2.. y =L= 80;

* Constraint 3: production capacity for Z
con3.. z =L= 50;

* Solve the problem
MODEL linearProg /all/;
solve linearProg maximizing z using lp;

* Display results
DISPLAY x.l, y.l, z.l;

* This code snippet solves a linear programming problem by declaring variables, defining an objective function and constraints, and solving the model using GAMS. The results are then displayed.
