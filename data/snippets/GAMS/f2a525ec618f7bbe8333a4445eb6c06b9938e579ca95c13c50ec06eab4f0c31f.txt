**** Setting up and solving a transportation problem in GAMS ****

! Transporting goods from three factories to four warehouses
Sets
     i   Factories /f1*f3/
     j   Warehouses /w1*w4/;

Parameters
     d(i)    Demand at each factory
             /f1 60, f2 70, f3 120/
     s(j)    Supply at each warehouse
             /w1 100, w2 90, w3 80, w4 110/;

Table c(i,j)    Cost of transporting one unit of goods from each factory to each warehouse
              w1       w2       w3       w4
f1   |         3         4         5         6
f2   |         2         2         1         5
f3   |         4         3         2         3;

Variables
     x(i,j)   Amount of goods transported from each factory to each warehouse;

Binary variable x;  % declaring x as a binary variable

Positive Variable x; % declaring x as a positive variable, meaning its value can only be positive

Equations
     cost        Define cost as the total cost of transportation
     factory(i)  Ensure that total amount transported from each factory is equal to its supply
     warehouse(j) Ensure that total amount received at each warehouse is equal to its demand;

% Objective function
cost..    z =e= sum((i,j), c(i,j)*x(i,j));

% Constraints
factory(i)..    sum(j, x(i,j)) =e= s(i);  % sum of amount transported from each factory must be less than or equal to its supply
warehouse(j)..  sum(i, x(i,j)) =e= d(j);  % sum of amount received at each warehouse must be less than or equal to its demand

Model transport /all/; % Creating a new model called "transport" and including all variables and equations in it

Solve transport using lp minimizing z; % Solving the model "transport" using the linear programming solver and minimizing the objective function z

Display x.l, 'Amount of goods transported from each factory to each warehouse'; % Displaying the values of variable x
