Sets 
     i     commodities /coal, iron/, j producers /Wyoming, Virginia/;
Alias (i,ij,k);
Parameters 
     p(i)   price of commodity i 
     a(ij)  availability of commodity i from producer j 
     b(k)   maximum production limit of producer k
;
Scalar 
     mfo   profit margin for optimization;

Positive Variables 
     x(i)   production of commodity i 
     z      total revenue;
Equations
     revenue definition of objective function 
     availability(j)  balance constraints on producerj 
     maxproduction(k) limit the production for producer k ;

* define objective function: maximize revenue
revenue.. z =e= sum(i, p(i) * x(i)) - mfo * sum(i, x(i));

* balance constraints for availability of commodities from each producer
availability(j).. sum(i, a(ij) * x(i)) =l= sum(i, x(i));

* define limit for maximum production for each producer
maxproduction(k).. sum(i, x(i)) =l= b(k);

* specify the total profit margin for optimization
mfo = 0.3;

* solve the optimization problem
Model production /all/;
Solve production using LP maximizing z;

* display the optimal production levels and total revenue
print x, z;
