set i Jobs /a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j/ - creates a set named 'i' with values 'a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j'
jobs as set i - creates another set named 'jobs' with the same values as set 'i'
Scalar - declares a scalar variable
p Profit - assigns the name 'p' to the scalar variable 'Profit'
d Distance - assigns the name 'd' to the scalar variable 'Distance'
r Rate - assigns the name 'r' to the scalar variable 'Rate'
c Cost - assigns the name 'c' to the scalar variable 'Cost'
t Time - assigns the name 't' to the scalar variable 'Time'
ix BaseInventory - assigns the name 'ix' to the scalar variable 'BaseInventory'
Table ci(i,j) Transportation costs - creates a table named 'ci' with indexes 'i' and 'j' to store transportation costs
ci(i,j)=5.5 - assigns the value '5.5' to all cells in the table 'ci'
Table dl(i,j) Distance traveled on each route - creates a table named 'dl' with indexes 'i' and 'j' to store distances traveled
dl(i,j)=8.0 - assigns the value '8.0' to all cells in the table 'dl'
Table pj(i) Profit potential for each job - creates a table named 'pj' with index 'i' to store profit potential for each job
pj(i) = UniformInt(50,200) - assigns a random integer between 50 and 200 to each cell in the table 'pj'
Table dt(i,j) Days required for each job - creates a table named 'dt' with indexes 'i' and 'j' to store days required for each job
dt(i,j) = UniformInt(5,20) - assigns a random integer between 5 and 20 to each cell in the table 'dt'
Table ca(i,j) Cost of materials for each job - creates a table named 'ca' with indexes 'i' and 'j' to store cost of materials for each job
ca(i,j) = UniformReal(1000,5000) - assigns a random real number between 1000 and 5000 to each cell in the table 'ca'
Table tr(j) Available time for each job - creates a table named 'tr' with index 'j' to store available time for each job
tr(j) = UniformReal(15,30) - assigns a random real number between 15 and 30 to each cell in the table 'tr'
Variables - declares a variable
q(i,j) Number of items to be transported - assigns the name 'q' to a variable with indexes 'i' and 'j'
x(i,j) Binary variable for selecting each route - assigns the name 'x' to a binary variable with indexes 'i' and 'j'
y(j) Binary variable for selecting each job - assigns the name 'y' to a binary variable with index 'j'
z Binary variable for selecting whether to take on job - assigns the name 'z' to a binary variable
Equations - declares an equation
crate Required container rate at each job - assigns the name 'crate' to an equation
obj Objective function - assigns the name 'obj' to an equation
Constraint c1(i,j) - assigns the name 'c1' to a constraint with indexes 'i' and 'j'
