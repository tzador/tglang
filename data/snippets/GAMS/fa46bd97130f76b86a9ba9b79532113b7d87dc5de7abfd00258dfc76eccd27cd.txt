*This is a GAMS model for a production planning problem*
Set
 i /i1*i3/   *set of products*

j /j1*j3/     *set of resources*

k /k1*k2/    *set of time periods*

d /d1*d3/     *set of seasonal factors/

Positive Variables:
 x(i,j,k)     *variable for the production quantities of each product at each resource for each period*
 y(j,d)       *variable for the number of workers needed at each resource for each season*

Parameters:
 p(i)         *parameter for the unit production cost of each product*
 q(j)         *parameter for the unit cost of each resource*
 f(i,k,d)     *parameter for the demand forecast for each product in each time period and season*

Binary Variable:
 z(i,j,k)     *binary variable to indicate whether a product is produced at a resource for a period or not*

Equations:
 objFunction   *objective function for minimizing total production and labor costs*
 resourceCap(j)     *constraint to limit the total number of workers required at each resource*
 productQuantity(i,k)    *constraint to meet the required production quantity for each product in each period*
 seasonDemand(i,k,d)     *constraint to meet the seasonal demand for each product in each period and season*
Binary Constraints:
resourceSelection(i,j,k,d)$(f(i,k,d)=0)    *binary constraint to prevent production at a resource when there is no demand*
