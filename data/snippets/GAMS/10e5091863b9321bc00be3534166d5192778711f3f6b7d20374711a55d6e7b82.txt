* Variables Declaration *
Variable x(i,j) Amount shipped from origin country to destination country;
Positive Variable x(i,j);  * Restricting variable to positive values *

* Objective Function *
Equation TotalCost;  * Define an equation for the objective function *
TotalCost.. sum(i, sum(j, d(i,j)*x(i,j)));  * Objective function to minimize total cost *

* Constraints *
Equation link(k);  * Define an equation to represent the link between origin and destination countries*
link(k).. sum(i$(ord(i) = ord(k)), x(i,j)) = sum(j$(ord(j) = ord(k)+3), x(i,j));  * Constraint to ensure that there is only one link between each origin and destination country pair *
Equation Demand(k);  * Define an equation to represent the demand from each destination country *
Demand(k).. sum(i, x(i,j)) = 50000;  * Constraint to ensure that the total amount shipped to each destination country is 50,000 *
