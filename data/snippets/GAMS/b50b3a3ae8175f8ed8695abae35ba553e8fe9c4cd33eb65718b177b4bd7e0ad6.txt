Sets
     i       Number of crops          / wheat, corn, soybeans, pod crops /
     k       Crops priced under market / wheat, corn /
     r       Revenue categories       / low, medium, high /;

Alias (i,j,k,r);

/*
This code snippet creates three different sets in GAMS: i, k, and r.
'i' represents the number of crops and contains four elements: wheat, corn, soybeans, and pod crops.
'k' represents crops that are priced under market and contains two elements: wheat and corn.
'r' represents three different revenue categories: low, medium, and high.
The 'Alias' function is used to assign aliases to the sets, simplifying the notation used in later parts of the code.
The comment block provides a brief explanation of the purpose of the code snippet.
