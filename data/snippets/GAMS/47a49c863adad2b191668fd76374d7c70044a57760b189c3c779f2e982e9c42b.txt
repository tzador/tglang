* This is a simple model in GAMS that solves a transportation problem

sets
    i   /1*5/;             * sets for origin
    j   /1*7/;             * sets for destination
    k   /1*3/;             * sets for commodities

parameters
    c(i,j)   /              * cost of transporting from i to j

    1   310    380    350   400    450    480    420 * cost from origin 1 to destination j
    2   280    300    360   390    410    430    440 * cost from origin 2 to destination j
    3   340    330    310   350    370    380    430 * cost from origin 3 to destination j
    4   300    340    350   330    460    480    400 * cost from origin 4 to destination j
    5   420    410    430   450    470    490    500 * cost from origin 5 to destination j

parameters
    a(j,k)   /              * available units for each commodity at each destination
        1      2      3
    1   200    250    150 * available units for commodity 1 at destination j
    2   300    180    200 * available units for commodity 2 at destination j
    3   250    220    280 * available units for commodity 3 at destination j

variables
    x(i,j,k)                * amount of commodity k transported from i to j

binary variables
    y(i,j)                  * decision variable for whether or not to transport from i to j

equations
    demand(j)               * equation for meeting demand at each destination
    supply(i)               * equation for meeting supply at each origin

demand(j).. sum(i, x(i,j,k)) =l= a(j,k); * constraint for meeting demand at each destination
supply(i).. sum(j, x(i,j,k)) =e= 1; * constraint for meeting supply at each origin

model transportation /demand, supply/; * defines the model with the demand and supply equations

option optcr=0; * sets the optimality criteria to 0 (no tolerance for optimality)

solve transportation using lp minimizing sum(i, sum(j, c(i,j)*x(i,j,k))); * solves the model using a linear programming solver and minimizing the total cost

display x.l, y.l; * displays the resulting values for x and y variables after solving the model
