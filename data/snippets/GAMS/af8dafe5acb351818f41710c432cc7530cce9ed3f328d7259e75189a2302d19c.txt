/* Creating a mathematical model for production planning problem */

Set       i       Set of production periods /1,2,3,4,5/;
          j       Set of products /A,B,C/;

Scalar    c(i)    Cost of production for each period;
          b(j)    Maximum demand for each product;
          M       Large positive constant;

Parameter prof(i,j) Profit for producing each product in each period;
Table     d(i,j)  Expected demand for each product in each period;
Table     w(i,j)  Setup time for each product in each period;

Variables x(i,j)  Amount of product to produce in each period;

Positive Variables x;

Binary Variable y(i) Variable to indicate if production is stopped in each period;

Equation obj      Objective function;
Equation cap(i)   Capacity constraint for each period;
Equation demand(j) Demand constraint for each product;
Equation stop(i)  Constraint for stopping production;
Equation nonneg   Non-negative constraint for production amounts;

obj..    sum((i,j), prof(i,j)*x(i,j) - c(i)*y(i))  =E=  sum((i,j), (1-y(i))*M);

cap(i).. sum(j, x(i,j))  =L=  M*(1-y(i));

demand(j).. sum(i, x(i,j))  =E=  w(i,j)*y(i);

stop(i).. y(i)  =L=  sum(j, x(i,j)*d(i,j));

nonneg.. x  =G=  0;
