* This model simulates a supply chain network with multiple manufacturing plants, warehouses, and retailers.

Sets
    i Manufacturing plants
    /Plant1, Plant2, Plant3, Plant4/
    j Warehouses
    /Warehouse1, Warehouse2, Warehouse3, Warehouse4, Warehouse5/
    k Retailers
    /Retailer1, Retailer2, Retailer3, Retailer4, Retailer5, Retailer6/;

Parameters
    demand(i) Demand at manufacturing plants
    /Plant1 50
    Plant2 70
    Plant3 60
    Plant4 80/;

Scalar
    unit_cost Unit cost of production
    /10/;

Table
    shipping_costs(i,j) Transportation cost from manufacturing plants to warehouses
    Warehouse1 Warehouse2 Warehouse3 Warehouse4 Warehouse5
    Plant1 5 7 3 6 8
    Plant2 4 8 6 4 5
    Plant3 3 5 2 9 7
    Plant4 6 7 4 5 6;

Variable
    x(i,j) Amount of goods shipped from manufacturing plants to warehouses
    y(j,k) Amount of goods shipped from warehouses to retailers
    z(k) Amount of goods sold at retailers;

Positive Variables
    x, y, z;

Equations
    Total_Cost, Supply(i), Demand(j), Balance(k), Sales;

Total_Cost.. sum((i,j), shipping_costs(i,j)*x(i,j)) + sum((j,k), shipping_costs(j,k)*y(j,k)) =E= unit_cost*z;

Supply(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =E= demand(i);

Demand(j).. sum(k, y(j,k)) =E= demand(j);

Balance(k).. z(k) =E= sum(j, y(j,k));

Sales.. sum(k, z(k)) =E= sum(x, y);

Model Supply_Chain /Total_Cost, Supply, Demand, Balance, Sales/;

Solve Supply_Chain using LP minimizing Total_Cost;
