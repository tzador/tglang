* This is a complex mathematical model that solves an optimization problem
Set i 'index of factories' /1*3/
    j 'index of products' /1*5/;
Parameter profit(i,j) 'profit potential of each product in each factory';
profit(i,j) = 5*(uniformInt(1,10));
Variables
    x(i,j) 'amount produced in each factory for each product';    
Equations
    obj 'maximize profit'
    res(i) 'production capacity constraint'
    res2(i,j) 'limit number of products per factory'
    res3(i,j) 'maintain minimum number of products per factory';
    
* Objective function to maximize profit
obj.. sum((i,j), profit(i,j)*x(i,j)) =E= z;
    
* Constraint to ensure production capacity is not exceeded in each factory
res(i).. sum(j, x(i,j)) =L= 100;
    
* Constraint to limit the number of products that can be produced in each factory
res2(i,j).. x(i,j) =L= 10;
    
* Constraint to maintain a minimum number of products in each factory
res3(i,j).. x(i,j) =G= 5;
