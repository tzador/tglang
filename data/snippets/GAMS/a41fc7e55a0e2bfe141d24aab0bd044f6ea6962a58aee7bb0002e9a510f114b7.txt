* This is a GAMS model that maximizes profit from a livestock farm

sets
       i     livestock types  / cows, pigs, chickens /;  * defining the set of all possible livestock types

* input parameters
parameters
       cp(i)  cost per unit of feed
       pf(i)  price per unit of livestock
       fp(i)  feed required per unit of livestock;

* model variables
variables
       x(i) livestock inventory;  * how many units of each livestock type to have
       
* objective function
equation objfunc;
objfunc.. sum(i, pf(i)*x(i)) - sum(i, cp(i)*fp(i)*x(i)) =e= profit;  * maximizing profit by subtracting feed cost from livestock sales revenue

* constraints
equation feedconstr(i);
feedconstr(i).. fp(i)*x(i) =g= 100;  * ensuring enough feed is available for each livestock type

* solve the model
model livestockfarm /objfunc, feedconstr/;
solve livestockfarm maximizing profit using lp;  * solving the model using linear programming algorithm

* display the results
display x.l, cp.l, pf.l, fp.l;  * displaying the optimal values for decision variables (x), and the prices and feed requirements (cp, pf, fp)
