* This is a GAMS model that solves a multi-period resource allocation problem
* It includes several constraints and sets to represent the problem
sets
t  periods /1*8/;
i  resources /1*3/;
tech(i,t) binary variable;  * indicates if resource i is used in period t
cost(i,t) cost variable;   * cost of using resource i in period t
balance(t) equation;       * balance constraint for each period
obj equation;              * objective function
positive variable obj;
tech.up(i,t) = 3;
cost.l(i,t) = round(10*uniform(0,1),1);
balance(t).. sum(i, cost.l(i,t)*tech(i,t)) =l= 100 + 10*(ord(t)-1);
obj.. obj =e= sum(t, objvariable*t + balance.l(t));
solve model using lp minimizing obj variable tecn;
