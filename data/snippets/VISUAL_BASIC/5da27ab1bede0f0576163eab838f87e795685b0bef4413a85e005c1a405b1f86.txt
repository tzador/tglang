' This program calculates the area and circumference of a circle

' Declare variables to store user input and calculated values
Dim radius As Double = 0 ' input variable for radius
Dim area As Double = 0 ' calculated area
Dim circumference As Double = 0 ' calculated circumference

' Get user input for radius
Console.Write("Enter the radius of the circle: ") ' prompt the user for input
radius = CDbl(Console.ReadLine()) ' convert user input to double and store in radius variable

' Calculate area and circumference
area = Math.PI * (radius ^ 2) ' formula for calculating area of a circle
circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius ' formula for calculating circumference of a circle

' Output the results to the user
Console.WriteLine("The area of the circle is: " & area) ' concatenate strings and output to console
Console.WriteLine("The circumference of the circle is: " & circumference) ' concatenate strings and output to console

' Pause the program to allow the user to view the results
Console.ReadLine() ' program will continue once the user presses Enter key

' End of program
