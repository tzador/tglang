' This code snippet is a simple sorting algorithm using a For...Next loop.
' It sorts numbers in ascending order.
' Declare an array of unsorted numbers
Dim numbers() As Integer = {5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3}

' Loop through the array using a For...Next loop
For i As Integer = 0 To UBound(numbers) - 1
    For j As Integer = i + 1 To UBound(numbers)
        ' Compare each number to the following number
        If numbers(i) > numbers(j) Then
            ' Swap the numbers if the current number is greater than the following number
            Dim temp As Integer = numbers(i)
            numbers(i) = numbers(j)
            numbers(j) = temp
        End If
    Next j
Next i

' The array is now sorted in ascending order
' Print out the sorted array
Console.WriteLine("Sorted numbers: ")
For k As Integer = 0 To UBound(numbers)
    Console.WriteLine(numbers(k))
Next k
