' This code snippet is used for creating a simple calculator in Visual Basic

' Define the variables for storing the numbers and result
Dim num1 As Integer
Dim num2 As Integer
Dim result As Integer

' Prompt the user to input the first number and store it in variable num1
num1 = InputBox("Enter the first number: ")

' Prompt the user to input the second number and store it in variable num2
num2 = InputBox("Enter the second number: ")

' Perform addition operation and store the result in variable result
result = num1 + num2

' Display the result to the user
MsgBox("The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & result)

' Prompt the user to input the first number and store it in variable num1
num1 = InputBox("Enter the first number: ")

' Prompt the user to input the second number and store it in variable num2
num2 = InputBox("Enter the second number: ")

' Perform subtraction operation and store the result in variable result
result = num1 - num2

' Display the result to the user
MsgBox("The difference between " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & result)

' Prompt the user to input the first number and store it in variable num1
num1 = InputBox("Enter the first number: ")

' Prompt the user to input the second number and store it in variable num2
num2 = InputBox("Enter the second number: ")

' Perform multiplication operation and store the result in variable result
result = num1 * num2

' Display the result to the user
MsgBox("The product of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & result)

' Prompt the user to input the first number and store it in variable num1
num1 = InputBox("Enter the first number: ")

' Prompt the user to input the second number and store it in variable num2
num2 = InputBox("Enter the second number: ")

' Perform division operation and store the result in variable result
result = num1 / num2

' Display the result to the user
MsgBox("The quotient of " & num1 & " divided by " & num2 & " is " & result)

' Prompt the user to input the first number and store it in variable num1
num1 = InputBox("Enter the first number: ")

' Prompt the user to input the second number and store it in variable num2
num2 = InputBox("Enter the second number: ")

' Perform modulus operation and store the result in variable result
result = num1 Mod num2

' Display the result to the user
MsgBox("The remainder when dividing " & num1 & " by " & num2 & " is " & result)
