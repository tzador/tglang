Sub main()

    ' variable declaration
    Dim length As Double ' stores the length of the rectangle
    Dim width As Double ' stores the width of the rectangle
    Dim area As Double ' stores the calculated area

    ' user input
    length = Val(InputBox("Enter the length of the rectangle: ")) ' prompts the user to enter the length and stores the input as a double
    width = Val(InputBox("Enter the width of the rectangle: ")) ' prompts the user to enter the width and stores the input as a double

    ' calculation
    area = length * width ' calculates the area of the rectangle

    ' output
    MsgBox "The area of the rectangle is: " & area ' displays the calculated area to the user
