' This code creates a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle

' Start by declaring variables for the length and width of the rectangle
Dim length As Integer
Dim width As Integer

' Prompt the user to enter a value for the length and store it in the length variable
Console.WriteLine("Enter the length of the rectangle:")
length = Console.ReadLine()

' Prompt the user to enter a value for the width and store it in the width variable
Console.WriteLine("Enter the width of the rectangle:")
width = Console.ReadLine()

' Calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width
Dim area As Integer = length * width

' Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle by adding the length and width and then multiplying by 2
Dim perimeter As Integer = (length + width) * 2

' Display the results to the user
Console.WriteLine("The area of the rectangle is " & area)
Console.WriteLine("The perimeter of the rectangle is " & perimeter)

' Check if the rectangle is a square by comparing the length and width
If length = width Then
    Console.WriteLine("This rectangle is a square.")
Else
    Console.WriteLine("This rectangle is not a square.")
End If
