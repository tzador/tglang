' This code snippet calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.

Dim sum As Integer ' declare a variable to store the sum
sum = 0 ' initialize the sum to 0

For i = 1 To 10 Step 1 ' loop from 1 to 10
    sum = sum + i ' add the current number to the sum
Next i ' repeat for each number in the range

Console.WriteLine("Sum of numbers from 1 to 10: " & sum) ' print the result to the console

' Output: Sum of numbers from 1 to 10: 55
