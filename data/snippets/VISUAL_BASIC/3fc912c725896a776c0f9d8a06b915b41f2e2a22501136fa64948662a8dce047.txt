' This code snippet demonstrates how to create a class in Visual Basic
' It includes constructors, properties, and methods

' Create a class called "Person"
Public Class Person

    ' Declare private variables
    Private _name As String
    Private _age As Integer
    Private _height As Double

    ' Create a constructor that accepts name, age, and height as parameters
    Public Sub New(name As String, age As Integer, height As Double)
        _name = name
        _age = age
        _height = height
    End Sub

    ' Create properties for each private variable
    Public Property Name As String
        Get
            Return _name
        End Get
        Set(value As String)
            _name = value
        End Set
    End Property

    Public Property Age As Integer
        Get
            Return _age
        End Get
        Set(value As Integer)
            _age = value
        End Set
    End Property

    Public Property Height As Double
        Get
            Return _height
        End Get
        Set(value As Double)
            _height = value
        End Set
    End Property

    ' Create a method called "Introduce" that prints out the person's name, age, and height
    Public Sub Introduce()
        Console.WriteLine("Hi, my name is " & _name & " and I am " & _age & " years old. I am " & _height & " meters tall.")
    End Sub
End Class

' Create an instance of the Person class
Dim person1 As Person = New Person("John", 25, 1.8)

' Call the Introduce method to print out the person's information
person1.Introduce()

' Output: Hi, my name is John and I am 25 years old. I am 1.8 meters tall.
