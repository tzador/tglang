' This code snippet calculates the average of an array of numbers

Dim numbers() As Integer = {4, 7, 9, 12, 17, 22, 28, 35, 41, 50} ' Declare and initialize array of numbers

Dim sum As Integer = 0  ' Initialize variable to store sum of numbers

For i As Integer = 0 To numbers.Length - 1 ' Loop through the array
    sum = sum + numbers(i) ' Add current number to sum
Next

Dim average As Integer = sum / numbers.Length ' Calculate average by dividing sum by number of elements

Console.WriteLine("The average of the numbers is: " & average) ' Output the average to the console
