' This is a complex code snippet in Visual Basic
' It contains multiple functions and loops
' It prints out a Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number
Option Explicit

Dim num1 As Integer ' First number in Fibonacci sequence
Dim num2 As Integer ' Second number in Fibonacci sequence
Dim numSeq As Integer ' User-specified limit for Fibonacci sequence
Dim count As Integer ' Counter for loop
Dim result As Integer ' Sum of num1 and num2

' Get user input for limit of Fibonacci sequence
Input "Enter the limit of the sequence: ", numSeq

' Initialize num1 and num2 to first 2 numbers in sequence
num1 = 1
num2 = 1

' Print out first 2 numbers in sequence
Print num1
Print num2

' Loop through Fibonacci sequence and print out each number
For count = 3 To numSeq
    result = num1 + num2 ' Calculate next number in sequence
    Print result ' Print out current number
    num1 = num2 ' Update num1 to previous number in sequence
    num2 = result ' Update num2 to current number in sequence
Next count
