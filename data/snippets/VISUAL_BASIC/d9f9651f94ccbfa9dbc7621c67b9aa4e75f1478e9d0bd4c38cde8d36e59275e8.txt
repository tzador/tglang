' This is a sample code snippet in Visual Basic

' Declaring and initializing variables
Dim intNum1 As Integer = 5
Dim intNum2 As Integer = 10

' Creating a function to calculate the sum of two numbers
Function CalculateSum(ByVal num1 As Integer, ByVal num2 As Integer) As Integer
    Dim sum As Integer = num1 + num2
    Return sum
End Function

' Calling the function and storing the result in a variable
Dim result As Integer = CalculateSum(intNum1, intNum2)

' Printing the result
Console.WriteLine("The sum of " & intNum1 & " and " & intNum2 & " is: " & result)

' Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is: 15
