' This program calculates the average of 10 numbers
' Declare variables

Dim sum As Integer ' variable to store sum
Dim average As Double ' variable to store average

' Initialize sum to 0

' Loop to input numbers and add them to the sum
For i = 0 To 9

    sum = sum + nums(i)
Next

' Calculate average using the sum and number of elements in array
average = sum / 10

' Display the average

' Bonus: find the largest number in the array
Dim largest As Integer ' variable to store largest number
largest = nums(0) ' initialize largest to first element in array
For i = 1 To 9
    If largest < nums(i) Then ' compare largest with current element
