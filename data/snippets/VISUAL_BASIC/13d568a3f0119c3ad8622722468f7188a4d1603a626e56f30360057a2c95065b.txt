' This code snippet calculates the average of three numbers
' and displays the result.

Module Module1
' Define a function to calculate the average
Function CalculateAverage(number1 As Integer, number2 As Integer, number3 As Integer) As Double

    ' Calculate the sum of the numbers
    Dim sum As Integer
    sum = number1 + number2 + number3

    ' Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of numbers
    Dim average As Double
    average = sum / 3

    ' Return the average
    Return average
End Function

Sub Main()

    Dim number2 As Integer = Console.ReadLine()
    Console.WriteLine("Enter the third number:")
    Dim number3 As Integer = Console.ReadLine()

    ' Call the function to calculate the average
    Dim average As Double
    average = CalculateAverage(number1, number2, number3)

    ' Display the result
