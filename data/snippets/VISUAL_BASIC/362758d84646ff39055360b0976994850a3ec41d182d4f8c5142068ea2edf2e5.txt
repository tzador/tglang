''' 
This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
It takes in an input from the user and prints the factorial.

Option Explicit

' Declare variables for user input and result
Dim num As Integer ' stores the number entered by the user
Dim result As Integer ' stores the factorial result

' Prompt user to enter a number and store it in the variable
num = InputBox("Enter a number:")

' Validate if the input is a positive integer
If num < 0 Then
    MsgBox "Please enter a positive integer."
Exit Sub
End If

' Call the factorial function and pass the input number
result = Factorial(num)

' Print the result
MsgBox num & "! = " & result

' Define the factorial function
Private Function Factorial(number As Integer) As Integer
    ' Base case
    If number <= 1 Then
        Factorial = 1
    Else
        ' Recursive call to factorial function
        Factorial = number * Factorial(number - 1)
