If number < 0 Then
    MsgBox("Factorial cannot be calculated for negative number")
    End ' Terminates the program
End If

' Calculation of factorial using a for loop
result = 1 ' Initial value of factorial equals to 1
For i = 1 To number ' Loop from 1 to the given number
    result = result * i ' Updates the result by multiplying with each number in the loop
Next i

' Displaying the result
MsgBox("Factorial of " & number & " is " & result) ' Displays a message box with the result of the factorial
