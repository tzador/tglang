' This program calculates the factorial of a given number
Option Explicit ' forces variable declaration before use

Sub Main()
    Dim num As Integer ' declares variable for input number
    Dim factorial As Long ' declares variable for calculated factorial value
    Dim i As Integer ' declares counter variable
    
    Console.Write("Enter a number: ") ' prompts user for input
    num = Console.ReadLine() ' stores input in num variable
    
    factorial = 1 ' sets initial value for factorial
    For i = num To 1 Step -1 ' loops through numbers from input down to 1
        factorial = factorial * i ' multiplies current factorial value by current number
    Next i
    
    Console.WriteLine("Factorial of " & num & " is: " & factorial) ' prints final factorial value
