' This code snippet is a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number
' It uses recursion to accomplish this task
' Input:
' - n: the number whose Fibonacci number is to be calculated
' Output:
' - the Fibonacci number of the given input

Function Fibonacci(n As Integer) As Integer
    If n = 0 Then ' base case
        Fibonacci = 0
    ElseIf n = 1 Then ' base case
        Fibonacci = 1
    Else ' recursive case
        Fibonacci = Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2) ' recursively calls the function to calculate the previous two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and adds them together
    End If
End Function

' Example:
' Input: 6
' Output: 8 (since the 6th Fibonacci number is 8)

MsgBox "The 6th Fibonacci number is: " & Fibonacci(6) ' displays the calculated Fibonacci number in a message box
