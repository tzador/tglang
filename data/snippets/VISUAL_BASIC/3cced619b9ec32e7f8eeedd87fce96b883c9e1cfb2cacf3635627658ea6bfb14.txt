# Here we define a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers
# The function takes in a list as a parameter and returns the average value
Function CalculateAverage(numbers As List(Of Double)) As Double

    # First, we define a variable to store the sum
    Dim sum As Double = 0
    
    # Next, we use a For Each loop to iterate through the list 
    # and add each number to the sum
    For Each num In numbers
        sum += num
    Next
    
    # Now, we divide the sum by the length of the list to get the average
    Dim average As Double = sum / numbers.Count
    
    # Finally, we return the average value
    Return average
