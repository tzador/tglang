'This code snippet demonstrates how to use a While loop in Visual Basic
'This example calculates the factorial of a given number using a While loop

'The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to the given number
'For example, the factorial of 5 would be 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

'Set the initial value of the number whose factorial needs to be calculated
Dim n As Integer = 5

'Initialize a variable to store the factorial
Dim factorial As Integer = 1
'Initialize a counter to keep track of the numbers multiplied
Dim i As Integer = 1

'Use a While loop to calculate the factorial
While i <= n
    'Multiply the current value of factorial with the value of i
    factorial = factorial * i
    'Increment i by 1 to multiply the next number
    i = i + 1
End While

'Print the result
Console.WriteLine("The factorial of " & n & " is: " & factorial)

'Output: The factorial of 5 is: 120
