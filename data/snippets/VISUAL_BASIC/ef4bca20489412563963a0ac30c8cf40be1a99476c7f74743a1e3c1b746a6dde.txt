' This code takes two numbers as input and outputs the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

' Define variables to hold the input numbers
Dim num1 As Integer
Dim num2 As Integer

' Prompt the user to enter the first number and store the input in num1
Console.WriteLine("Enter the first number:")
num1 = Console.ReadLine()

' Prompt the user to enter the second number and store the input in num2
Console.WriteLine("Enter the second number:")
num2 = Console.ReadLine()

' Calculate and output the sum of the two numbers
Dim sum As Integer = num1 + num2
Console.WriteLine("Sum: " & sum)

' Calculate and output the difference of the two numbers
Dim difference As Integer = num1 - num2
Console.WriteLine("Difference: " & difference)

' Calculate and output the product of the two numbers
Dim product As Integer = num1 * num2
Console.WriteLine("Product: " & product)

' Make sure the user does not input a 0 for the second number (cannot divide by 0)
If num2 = 0 Then
    Console.WriteLine("Cannot divide by 0.")
Else
    ' Calculate and output the quotient of the two numbers
    Dim quotient As Double = num1 / num2
    Console.WriteLine("Quotient: " & quotient)
End If

' Output a message indicating the end of the program
Console.WriteLine("End of program.")
