' This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

Public Function Factorial(ByVal num As Integer) As Integer
    If num = 0 Then
        Factorial = 1
    Else
        Factorial = num * Factorial(num - 1)
    End If
End Function

' To calculate the factorial of 5, we call the Factorial function and pass in 5 as the parameter.
Dim result As Integer = Factorial(5)

' The result will be 120, as 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
