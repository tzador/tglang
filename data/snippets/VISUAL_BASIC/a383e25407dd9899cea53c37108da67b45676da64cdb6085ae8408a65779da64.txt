'This is a code snippet in Visual Basic
'This program calculates the area of a rectangle

'First we define the variables
Dim length As Double 'variable to store the length of the rectangle
Dim width As Double 'variable to store the width of the rectangle
Dim area As Double 'variable to store the calculated area

'Next we prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle
Console.WriteLine("Enter the length of the rectangle:")
length = Double.Parse(Console.ReadLine()) 'converts user input from string to double and assigns it to the variable "length"
Console.WriteLine("Enter the width of the rectangle:")
width = Double.Parse(Console.ReadLine()) 'converts user input from string to double and assigns it to the variable "width"

'Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula: length * width
area = length * width

'Print the calculated area to the console
Console.WriteLine("The area of the rectangle is " & area)

'Finally we add a condition to check if the rectangle is a square
If length = width Then
    Console.WriteLine("The rectangle is a square.")
Else
    Console.WriteLine("The rectangle is not a square.")
End If

'Example output:
'Enter the length of the rectangle:
'5
'Enter the width of the rectangle:
'5
'The area of the rectangle is 25
'The rectangle is a square.
