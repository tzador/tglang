'This code snippet generates a random string of capitalized letters and numbers with a length of 10 characters

Dim rand As New Random() 'creates a new instance of the Random class
Dim availableChars As String = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789" 'string of available characters
Dim result As String = "" 'variable to store the generated string

For i = 1 to 10 'looping 10 times to generate 10 characters
    Dim index As Integer = rand.Next(availableChars.Length) 'generates a random index within the length of availableChars
    result &= availableChars(index) 'appends the character at the random index to the result string
Next

Console.WriteLine("Random string: " & result) 'prints the generated random string to the console
