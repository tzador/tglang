'This is a complex code snippet in Visual Basic
'This program calculates the area of a circle

'Variable declaration
Dim radius As Double 'Stores the radius of the circle
Dim pi As Double 'Stores the value of pi
Dim area As Double 'Stores the calculated area of the circle

'Input from the user
Console.Write("Enter the radius of the circle: ") 'Prompts user to input a value
radius = Console.ReadLine() 'Reads the user's input and assigns it to the radius variable

'Set the value of pi to a constant
Const PI = 3.14159

'Calculation
area = PI * radius * radius 'Calculates the area of the circle using the formula A = Ï€*r^2

'Output
Console.WriteLine("The area of the circle with radius " & radius & " is " & area) 'Prints the result to the console

'End of program
Console.ReadLine() 'Keeps the console open until the user presses enter
