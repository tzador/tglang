REM This program calculates the roots of a quadratic equation
REM ax^2 + bx + c = 0
REM Define variables
Dim a As Double     'coefficients of x^2
Dim b As Double     'coefficients of x
Dim c As Double     'constant
Dim root1, root2 As Double 'the two roots of the equation

REM Get input from user
a = InputBox("Enter the value of a:")
b = InputBox("Enter the value of b:")
c = InputBox("Enter the value of c:")

REM Calculate the discriminant D = b^2 - 4ac
Dim D As Double
D = b ^ 2 - 4 * a * c

REM Perform calculation and display the roots
If D > 0 Then     'if D is positive, there are two real roots
    root1 = (-b + Sqr(D)) / (2 * a)
    root2 = (-b - Sqr(D)) / (2 * a)
    MsgBox "The roots are " & root1 & " and " & root2
ElseIf D = 0 Then     'if D is zero, there is one real root
    root1 = -b / (2 * a)
    MsgBox "The root is " & root1
Else     'if D is negative, there are two imaginary roots
    Dim realPart As Double
    Dim imaginaryPart As Double
    realPart = -b / (2 * a)
    imaginaryPart = Sqr(-D) / (2 * a)
    MsgBox "The roots are " & realPart & " + " & imaginaryPart & "i and " & realPart & " - " & imaginaryPart & "i"
