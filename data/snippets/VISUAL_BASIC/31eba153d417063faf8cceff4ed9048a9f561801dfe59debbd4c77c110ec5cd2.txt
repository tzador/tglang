''' This program calculates the average of a list of numbers '''

' initialize variables '
Dim numbers(10) As Integer 'create an array of size 10 to store numbers
Dim sum As Double = 0 'initialize sum variable as 0
Dim average As Double = 0 'initialize average variable as 0

' use a for loop to input numbers into the array '
For i = 0 To numbers.Length - 1 'loop through the array
    Console.WriteLine("Enter a number: ")
    numbers(i) = Console.ReadLine() 'input number and store it in the current index of the array
Next

' use a for loop to calculate the sum of the numbers in the array '
For i = 0 To numbers.Length - 1 'loop through the array
    sum = sum + numbers(i) 'add the current number to the sum variable
Next

' calculate the average '
average = sum / numbers.Length 'divide the sum by the number of elements in the array to get the average

' print the average '
Console.WriteLine("The average of the numbers is: " & average) 'print the average to the console
