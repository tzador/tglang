' This code snippet performs a bubble sort on an array of integers

Sub bubbleSort(ByRef arr() As Integer)

    Dim temp As Integer
    Dim i, j As Integer

    For i = 0 To UBound(arr) - 1 ' Loop through all elements in the array
        For j = 0 To UBound(arr) - 1 - i ' Compare elements adjacent to each other
            If arr(j) > arr(j + 1) Then ' If first element is greater than second
                temp = arr(j) ' Swap the two elements
                arr(j) = arr(j + 1)
                arr(j + 1) = temp
            End If
        Next j
    Next i
End Sub

' Sample usage
Dim myArray() As Integer = {5, 2, 7, 1, 10} ' Create an array of integers
bubbleSort(myArr) ' Call the bubbleSort function passing in the array
' The array will now be sorted in ascending order with the values: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10
