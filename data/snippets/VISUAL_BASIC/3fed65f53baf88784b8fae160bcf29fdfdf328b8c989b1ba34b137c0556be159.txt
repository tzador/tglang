    Dim pi As Double ' declare variable for pi
    pi = 3.14159265358979 ' set pi value
    Console.WriteLine("Please enter the radius of the circle: ")
    radius = Console.ReadLine() ' read user input for radius
    area = pi * radius ^ 2 ' calculate area of circle
    Console.WriteLine("The area of the circle with radius " & radius & " is " & area) ' print result
