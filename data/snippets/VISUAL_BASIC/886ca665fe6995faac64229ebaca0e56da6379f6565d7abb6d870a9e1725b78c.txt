' This code snippet demonstrates a bubble sort algorithm in Visual Basic

Sub BubbleSort(arr As Variant)
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim j As Integer
    Dim temp As Variant
    Dim length As Integer
    length = UBound(arr)

    For i = 0 To length - 1
        For j = 0 To length - i - 1
            If arr(j) > arr(j + 1) Then
                ' Swap values
                temp = arr(j)
                arr(j) = arr(j + 1)
                arr(j + 1) = temp
            End If
        Next j
    Next i
End Sub

' Example usage
Dim num_arr As Variant
num_arr = Array(5, 2, 8, 1, 4)
Call BubbleSort(num_arr) ' Sorts the array in ascending order
