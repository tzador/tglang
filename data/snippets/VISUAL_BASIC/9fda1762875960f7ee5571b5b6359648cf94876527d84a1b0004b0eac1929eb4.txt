' This code snippet is a function to calculate the area of a triangle using the Heron's formula
'
' Input: a, b, c (sides of the triangle)
' Output: area

Function CalculateTriangleArea(ByVal a As Double, ByVal b As Double, ByVal c As Double) As Double
    ' Calculate the semiperimeter of the triangle
    Dim s As Double
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    
    ' Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    Dim area As Double
    area = Sqr(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    
    ' Return the calculated area
    CalculateTriangleArea = area
End Function
