' This program calculates the area of a circle
Option Explicit ' ensures that all variables are declared
Sub CalculateArea()
    Dim radius As Double ' declares radius variable as a double (decimal) data type
    Dim pi As Double ' declares pi variable as a double (decimal) data type
    Dim area As Double ' declares area variable as a double (decimal) data type

    pi = 3.14159 ' assigns value of pi to variable
    radius = InputBox("Enter the radius of the circle:") ' prompts user to input the radius value
    area = pi * (radius ^ 2) ' calculates the area of the circle using the formula A = Ï€r^2

    MsgBox "The area of the circle is " & area ' displays the result to the user using a message box
End Sub
