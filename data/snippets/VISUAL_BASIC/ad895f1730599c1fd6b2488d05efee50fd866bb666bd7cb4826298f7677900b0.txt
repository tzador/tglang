'This is a code snippet in VISUAL_BASIC that generates a random password with specified length.
'
'Declare a variable to hold the length of the password
Dim length As Integer
'
'Generate a random number between 6 and 15 (inclusive) for the password length
Randomize 'Seed the random number generator
length = Int(6 + Rnd * 10) ' Generate a random number between 6 and 15 (inclusive)
'
'Create an array of characters to be used in the password
Dim chars As String 'Declare variable to hold characters
chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789@#$%&"
'
'Create an empty string variable to hold the randomly generated password
Dim password As String 'Declare password variable
password = "" 'Initialize empty string
'
'Loop through the array of characters, randomly selecting one to add to the password
For i = 1 To length 'Loop for specified password length
    password = password & Mid(chars, Int(1 + Rnd * Len(chars)), 1) 'Select a random character from the array and add it to the password string
Next i
'
'Output the randomly generated password
MsgBox "Your randomly generated password is: " & password
