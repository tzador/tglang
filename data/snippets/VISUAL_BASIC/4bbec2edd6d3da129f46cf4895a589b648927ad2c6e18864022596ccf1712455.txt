Sub Main()

    Dim numStudents, totalGrade, averageGrade, i As Integer ' declare variables (numStudents and totalGrade as Integer, averageGrade and i as Double)

    numStudents = InputBox("How many students are in the class?") ' prompt user to input number of students

    For i = 1 To numStudents ' loop through each student
        totalGrade = totalGrade + InputBox("Enter grade for student " & i) ' prompt user to input grade for current student
    Next i

    averageGrade = totalGrade / numStudents ' calculate average grade

    MsgBox "The average grade for the class is " & averageGrade ' display message box with average grade
