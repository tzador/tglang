' This code snippet is a simple calculator program in VISUAL_BASIC
' It takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations
' Author: John Smith

' Declaring variables
Dim num1, num2 As Integer
Dim sum, difference, product, quotient As Integer

' Taking user input 
Console.WriteLine("Enter the first number:")
num1 = Console.ReadLine()
Console.WriteLine("Enter the second number:")
num2 = Console.ReadLine()

' Performing addition and storing the result in sum variable
sum = num1 + num2

' Performing subtraction and storing the result in difference variable
difference = num1 - num2

' Performing multiplication and storing the result in product variable
product = num1 * num2

' Performing division and storing the result in quotient variable
quotient = num1 / num2

' Displaying the results to the user
Console.WriteLine("--------------------")
Console.WriteLine("Sum: " & sum)
Console.WriteLine("Difference: " & difference)
Console.WriteLine("Product: " & product)
Console.WriteLine("Quotient: " & quotient)
