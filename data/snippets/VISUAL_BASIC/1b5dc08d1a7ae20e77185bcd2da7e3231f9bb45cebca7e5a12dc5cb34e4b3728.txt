' This is a program that calculates the factorial of a given number

' Define variables
Dim num As Integer ' holds the input number
Dim result As Integer ' holds the factorial result

' Get input from user
Console.WriteLine("Enter a number:")
num = CInt(Console.ReadLine())

' Calculate the factorial using a loop
For i = 1 To num
    result = result * i
Next

' Print the result
Console.WriteLine("The factorial of " & num & " is " & result)

' This function calculates the factorial of a given number recursively
Function factorial(ByVal num As Integer) As Integer
    If num = 0 Then ' base case
        factorial = 1
    Else
        factorial = num * factorial(num - 1) ' recursive call
    End If
End Function

' Print the result of calling the factorial function
Console.WriteLine("Using recursion, the factorial of " & num & " is " & factorial(num))
