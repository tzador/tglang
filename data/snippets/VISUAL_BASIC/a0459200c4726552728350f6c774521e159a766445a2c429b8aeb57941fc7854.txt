' This code snippet is a demonstration of a sorting algorithm in Visual Basic.

' Create an array of integers to be sorted
Dim arr(9) As Integer

' Fill the array with random integers
For i = 0 To 9
    arr(i) = Int(Rnd * 100) ' generates random integer between 0 and 99
Next i

' Display the unsorted array as a string
Console.WriteLine("Unsorted array: " & Join(arr, ", "))

' Define a variable to track the number of swaps made during sorting
Dim numSwaps As Integer

' Use bubble sort algorithm to sort the array
For i = 0 To UBound(arr) - 1
    For j = 0 To UBound(arr) - i - 1
        ' Compare adjacent elements and swap if necessary
        If arr(j) > arr(j + 1) Then
            ' Use temporary variable to perform the swap
            Dim temp As Integer
            temp = arr(j)
            arr(j) = arr(j + 1)
            arr(j + 1) = temp
            ' Increment the number of swaps
            numSwaps = numSwaps + 1
        End If
    Next j
Next i

' Display the sorted array as a string
Console.WriteLine("Sorted array: " & Join(arr, ", "))

' Display the number of swaps made during sorting
Console.WriteLine("Number of swaps: " & numSwaps)
