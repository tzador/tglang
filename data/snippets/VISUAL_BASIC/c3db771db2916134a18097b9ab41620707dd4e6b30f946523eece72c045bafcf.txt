' This is a complex code snippet in Visual Basic that creates a nested loop
' and uses conditional statements to manipulate the output.

Option Explicit

' Create a variable to store the maximum number of iterations for the outer loop.
Dim outerLoopLimit As Integer = 5

' Create a variable to store the maximum number of iterations for the inner loop.
Dim innerLoopLimit As Integer = 3

' Create a nested for loop to print out numbers from 1 to outer loop limit.
For i = 1 To outerLoopLimit

    ' Create a nested for loop to print out numbers from 1 to inner loop limit.
    For j = 1 To innerLoopLimit

        ' Use an if statement to check if the product of i and j is greater than 10.
        If (i * j) > 10 Then

            ' If it is, print out a message stating the product and the loop iteration numbers.
            Console.WriteLine("The product of " & i & " and " & j & " is greater than 10.")

        ' If the product is not greater than 10, print out a message stating the loop iteration numbers.
        Else
            Console.WriteLine("Current iteration numbers are: " & i & ", " & j)
        End If

    Next j ' End inner for loop.

Next i ' End outer for loop.

' Output:
