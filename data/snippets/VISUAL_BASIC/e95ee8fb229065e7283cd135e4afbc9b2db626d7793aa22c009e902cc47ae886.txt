' This is a comment in Visual Basic
' It is useful for adding notes to your code
' Here, we are declaring variables for our code

Dim firstNumber As Integer ' declare a variable for first number
Dim secondNumber As Integer ' declare a variable for second number
Dim result As Integer ' declare a variable for storing the result

' We will ask the user to enter the first number using the InputBox function
firstNumber = Val(InputBox("Enter the first number:"))

' We will then ask the user to enter the second number
' We will use the InputBox function again and convert the input into an integer using the Val function
secondNumber = Val(InputBox("Enter the second number:"))

' To perform addition, we will use the "+" operator and store the result in the "result" variable
result = firstNumber + secondNumber

' We will display the result to the user using the MsgBox function
' The result will be converted to a string using the CStr function
MsgBox("The result is: " & CStr(result))

' Now, we will perform subtraction using the "-" operator
result = firstNumber - secondNumber

' We will again display the result using the MsgBox function
MsgBox("The result of subtraction is: " & CStr(result))

' Next, we will perform multiplication using the "*" operator
result = firstNumber * secondNumber

' We will display the result using the MsgBox function
MsgBox("The result of multiplication is: " & CStr(result))

' Finally, we will perform division using the "/" operator
' To avoid any errors, we will use the "IIf" function to check if the second number is equal to 0
' If it is 0, we will display an error message, otherwise we will perform the division and display the result
MsgBox(IIf(secondNumber = 0, "Cannot divide by 0!", "The result of division is: " & CStr(firstNumber / secondNumber)))

' Ending our code with a message to the user
MsgBox("Thank you for using this calculator!")
