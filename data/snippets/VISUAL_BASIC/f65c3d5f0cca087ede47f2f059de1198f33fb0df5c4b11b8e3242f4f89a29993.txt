' This code snippet is a Visual Basic program that performs matrix multiplication '
' It takes in two matrices and outputs their product '

Public Sub Main()
    ' Define two matrices '
    Dim matrixA As Integer(,) = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} ' First matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns '
    Dim matrixB As Integer(,) = {{7, 8}, {9, 10}, {11, 12}} ' Second matrix with 3 rows and 2 columns '

    ' Calculate the number of rows and columns in the resulting matrix '
    Dim resultRows As Integer = matrixA.GetLength(0) ' Number of rows in matrixA '
    Dim resultCols As Integer = matrixB.GetLength(1) ' Number of columns in matrixB '

    ' Create the resulting matrix with appropriate dimensions '
    Dim resultMatrix As Integer(,) = New Integer(resultRows - 1, resultCols - 1) {}

    ' Perform the multiplication '
    For i As Integer = 0 To resultRows - 1 ' Loop through each row in the resulting matrix '
        For j As Integer = 0 To resultCols - 1 ' Loop through each column in the resulting matrix '
            For k As Integer = 0 To matrixA.GetLength(1) - 1 ' Loop through the common dimension '
                resultMatrix(i, j) += matrixA(i, k) * matrixB(k, j) ' Add the product of corresponding elements '
            Next
        Next
    Next

    ' Print the resulting matrix '
    Console.WriteLine("The product of the two matrices is:")
    For i As Integer = 0 To resultRows - 1 ' Loop through each row in the resulting matrix '
        For j As Integer = 0 To resultCols - 1 ' Loop through each column in the resulting matrix '
            Console.Write(resultMatrix(i, j) & " ") ' Print each element '
        Next
        Console.WriteLine() ' Move to the next line '
    Next
End Sub

' Output:
' The product of the two matrices is:
' 58 64
' 139 154
' 
' Explanation:
' This code snippet first defines two matrices, matrixA and matrixB.
' It then calculates the number of rows and columns in the resulting matrix, which is equal to the number of rows in matrixA and the number of columns in matrixB.
' Next, it creates the resulting matrix with the appropriate dimensions.
' The nested for loop then performs the actual multiplication, using the common dimension between the two matrices.
' Finally, the resulting matrix is printed out in a readable format.
