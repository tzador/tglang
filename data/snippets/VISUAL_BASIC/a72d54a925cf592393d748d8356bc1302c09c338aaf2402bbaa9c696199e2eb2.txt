' This program uses a loop to calculate the factorial of a user-entered number

' Input
Dim num As Integer
Console.Write("Enter a number: ")
num = Console.ReadLine()

' Initialize variables 
Dim factorial As Integer = 1
Dim i As Integer = 1

' Loop to calculate factorial
Do While i <= num
    factorial = factorial * i
    i = i + 1
Loop

' Output
Console.WriteLine("Factorial of " & num & " is " & factorial)

'Example output for user-entered number 5:
'Factorial of 5 is 120
