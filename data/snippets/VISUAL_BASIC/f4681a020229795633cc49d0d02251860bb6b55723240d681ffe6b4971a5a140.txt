' This program calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
Option Explicit ' forces explicit declaration of all variables

' initialize variables
Dim n As Integer ' holds value of nth term
Dim first_term As Integer ' holds value of first term in sequence
Dim second_term As Integer ' holds value of second term in sequence
Dim nth_term As Integer ' holds value of nth term in sequence

' prompt user for input
Console.Write("Enter the value of n: ") ' asks user for input
n = Console.ReadLine() ' reads user input

' set first two terms in sequence to 0 and 1
first_term = 0 ' first term in sequence is always 0
second_term = 1 ' second term in sequence is always 1

' calculate nth term in sequence
For i = 0 To n Step 1 ' iterates from 0 to n with a step of 1
    If i = 1 Then ' if i is equal to 1, nth term is set to first term
        nth_term = first_term
    ElseIf i = 2 Then ' if i is equal to 2, nth term is set to second term
        nth_term = second_term
    Else ' if i is greater than 2, calculate nth term using previous two terms
        nth_term = first_term + second_term
        first_term = second_term ' shift first term to become previous term for next iteration
        second_term = nth_term ' set second term as current nth term for next iteration
    End If

' display nth term in sequence
Console.WriteLine("The nth term in the Fibonacci sequence is: " & nth_term) ' displays nth term to user
