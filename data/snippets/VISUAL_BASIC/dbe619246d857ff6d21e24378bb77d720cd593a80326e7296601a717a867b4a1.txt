' This program calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given range
' Input variables
Dim num1 As Integer ' starting number of the range
Dim num2 As Integer ' ending number of the range
Dim sum As Integer ' variable to store the sum
Dim i As Integer ' loop counter variable

' Prompt user to enter the starting and ending numbers
Console.WriteLine("Enter the starting number:")
num1 = CInt(Console.ReadLine())
Console.WriteLine("Enter the ending number:")
num2 = CInt(Console.ReadLine())

' Loop to iterate through the numbers in the given range
For i = num1 To num2
    ' Check if the number is even
    If i Mod 2 = 0 Then
        ' Add the number to the sum variable
        sum += i
    End If
Next

' Print the result
Console.WriteLine("The sum of all even numbers from " & num1 & " to " & num2 & " is " & sum)

' Output:
' Enter the starting number:
' 2
' Enter the ending number:
' 10
' The sum of all even numbers from 2 to 10 is 30
