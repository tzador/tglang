' This is a code snippet in Visual Basic
' It demonstrates the use of for loops and arrays
Dim arrNumbers() As Integer 'create an array of integers
arrNumbers = New Integer() {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 'initialize the array with values
'use for loop to print out each element in the array
For i As Integer = 0 To arrNumbers.Length - 1 
    Console.WriteLine(arrNumbers(i)) 'prints out the current element in the array
Next 'move to next element in the array
'create a two-dimensional array
Dim arr2D(,) As String = New String(3, 3) {}
arr2D(0, 0) = "Dog" 'assign values to each element in the array
arr2D(1, 0) = "Cat"
arr2D(0, 1) = "Fish"
arr2D(1, 1) = "Bird"
'use nested for loops to print out each element in the two-dimensional array
For i As Integer = 0 To arr2D.GetLength(0) - 1
    For j As Integer = 0 To arr2D.GetLength(1) - 1
        Console.WriteLine(arr2D(i, j))
    Next 'move to the next column in the array
Next 'move to the next row in the array
Console.ReadLine() 'allows user to see the outputs before closing the program
