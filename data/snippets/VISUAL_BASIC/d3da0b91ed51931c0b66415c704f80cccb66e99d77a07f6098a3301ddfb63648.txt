' This program calculates the factorial of a number

' Variable to store the input from user
Dim number As Integer

' Variable to store the factorial result
Dim factorialResult As Long

' Prompt user to enter a number
Console.WriteLine("Enter a number:")

' Get input from user
number = Console.ReadLine()

' Calculate factorial
factorialResult = 1

' Loop through all numbers from 1 to the input number
For i = 1 To number
    ' Multiply factorial result by current number
    factorialResult = factorialResult * i
Next

' Print result to console
Console.WriteLine("The factorial of " & number & " is " & factorialResult)

' End program
