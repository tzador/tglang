''''This is a complex code snippet in VISUAL_BASIC

'Set variables
Dim firstName, lastName As String 'declaring two string variables
Dim age As Integer 'declaring an integer variable

'Prompt user for input
firstName = InputBox("What is your first name?") 'stores user's first name in the variable "firstName"
lastName = InputBox("What is your last name?") 'stores user's last name in the variable "lastName"
age = InputBox("How old are you?") 'stores user's age in the variable "age"

'Check if age is valid
If age <= 0 Or age > 120 Then 'if age is less than or equal to 0 or greater than 120
    MsgBox("Please enter a valid age.") 'display message to user
    Exit Sub 'exit the program
End If

'Create full name string
Dim fullName As String 'declaring a string variable for full name
fullName = firstName & " " & lastName 'concatenating first and last name with a space in between

'Display message with full name and age
MsgBox("Hello, " & fullName & "! You are " & age & " years old.") 'display message to user with full name and age

'Clear variables
firstName = "" 'clear first name variable
lastName = "" 'clear last name variable
age = 0 'clear age variable
