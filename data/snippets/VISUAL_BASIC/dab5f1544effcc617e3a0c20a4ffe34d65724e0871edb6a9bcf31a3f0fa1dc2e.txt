' This code snippet demonstrates a simple for loop in Visual Basic
For x As Integer = 0 To 10 ' Initialize an integer variable x to 0 and loop through values from 0 to 10
    If x Mod 2 = 0 Then ' Check if x is divisible by 2 with no remainder
        Console.WriteLine("The value of x is even: " & x) ' Print a message indicating the value of x is even
    Else
        Console.WriteLine("The value of x is odd: " & x) ' Print a message indicating the value of x is odd
    End If
Next ' Move to the next value in the loop

' Output:
' The value of x is even: 0
' The value of x is odd: 1
' The value of x is even: 2
' The value of x is odd: 3
' The value of x is even: 4
' The value of x is odd: 5
' The value of x is even: 6
' The value of x is odd: 7
' The value of x is even: 8
' The value of x is odd: 9
' The value of x is even: 10
