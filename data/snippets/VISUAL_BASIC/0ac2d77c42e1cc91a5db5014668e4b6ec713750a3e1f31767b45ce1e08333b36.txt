> This is a code snippet in VISUAL_BASIC that implements a simple sorting algorithm. It starts by defining a function called SortingAlgorithm which takes in an array as its parameter. It then declares a variable n that represents the length of the array and a variable called swapped which will be used to check if any elements have been swapped during the sorting process.

> The actual sorting process is done through a for loop which runs from 0 to n-1. Within the loop, an if statement checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if so, it calls the Swap function to swap the positions of the elements.

> After the for loop, there is another if statement that checks if any elements have been swapped. If so, the code goes back to the label and continues with the sorting process until there are no more swaps to be made.

> Finally, there is a Swap function that takes in two integer parameters and uses a temporary variable to swap the values of the variables. This process is repeated until the array is sorted in ascending order.
