' Function to calculate factorial using recursion
Function factorial(ByVal num As Integer) As Decimal
    If num = 0 Then 'base case
        factorial = 1
    Else
        factorial = num * factorial(num - 1) ' recursive call
    End If
End Function

' Main code
Sub Main()
    Dim num As Integer ' declare a variable to hold the number
    num = InputBox("Enter a number: ") ' prompt user to input a number
    Dim fact As Decimal ' declare a variable to hold the factorial value
    fact = factorial(num) ' call the recursive function
    Console.WriteLine("Factorial of " & num & " is " & fact) ' display the result
    Console.ReadLine() ' wait for user input before closing console window
End Sub

' Sample output for input number 5:
' Factorial of 5 is 120
