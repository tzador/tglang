' This is a long and complex code snippet in Visual Basic
'
Dim i As Integer ' declare a variable of type Integer
i = 0 ' assign the value 0 to the variable i
Do While i < 10 ' start a loop that runs as long as i is less than 10
    If i = 5 Then ' check if i is equal to 5
        Console.WriteLine("i is equal to 5") ' output a message to the console
    Else If i = 8 Then ' check if i is equal to 8
        Console.WriteLine("i is equal to 8") ' output a different message to the console
    Else ' if i is not equal to 5 or 8
        Console.WriteLine("i is not equal to 5 or 8") ' output a different message to the console
    End If ' end the if statement
    i = i + 1 ' increment i by 1 to continue the loop
Loop ' end the loop

' define a function with two parameters
Function addNumbers(num1 As Integer, num2 As Integer)
    Dim result As Integer ' declare a variable of type Integer
    result = num1 + num2 ' add the two numbers and assign it to result
    Return result ' return the calculated result
End Function ' end the function definition

Dim x As Integer ' declare a variable of type Integer
x = addNumbers(3, 5) ' call the addNumbers function with the parameters 3 and 5, and assign the returned value to x
Console.WriteLine("The sum of 3 and 5 is: " & x) ' output the result to the console

' start a try-catch block
Try
    Dim y As Integer ' declare a variable of type Integer
    y = 10 / 0 ' perform a division by 0 to trigger an error
Catch ex As DivideByZeroException ' catch the specific DivideByZeroException
    Console.WriteLine("Error: Cannot divide by 0") ' output a message to the console
End Try ' end the try-catch block

' create a class with two properties and a method
Class Person
    Public Property Name As String ' define a public property called Name of type String
    Private Property Age As Integer ' define a private property called Age of type Integer
    
    ' create a method to set the age property
    Public Sub SetAge(newAge As Integer)
        Age = newAge ' set the value of Age to newAge
    End Sub ' end the method definition
End Class ' end the class definition

' create an instance of the Person class
Dim person1 As New Person ' create a new object person1 of type Person
person1.Name = "John" ' set the Name property of person1 to "John"
person1.SetAge(25) ' call the SetAge method of person1 and pass in the parameter 25

Console.WriteLine(person1.Name & " is " & person1.Age & " years old") ' output a message using the properties of person1 to the console
