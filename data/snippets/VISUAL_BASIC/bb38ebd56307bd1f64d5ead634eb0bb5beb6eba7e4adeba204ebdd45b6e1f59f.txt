' This code snippet creates a function that checks if a given number is a prime number or not

        isPrime = True
    Else ' for numbers greater than 2, we use a loop to check if the number is divisible by any numbers up to its square root
        For i As Integer = 2 To Math.Sqrt(number)
            If number Mod i = 0 Then ' if the number is divisible by another number, it's not a prime number. We can return False and exit the loop.

' example call to the function
PrimeNumberCheck(13) ' outputs "13 is a prime number."
