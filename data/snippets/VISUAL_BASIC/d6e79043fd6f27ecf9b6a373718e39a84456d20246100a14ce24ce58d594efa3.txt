'This code snippet calculates the average of an array of numbers
'Assuming the array is named "numbers" and has values already assigned
Dim sum As Double
Dim avg As Double
Dim count As Integer

'Loop through the array and add each value to the sum
For i = 0 To UBound(numbers)
    sum = sum + numbers(i)
    count = count + 1 'increase count for each value added to sum
Next i

'Calculate average by dividing sum by count
avg = sum / count

'Print out the average
Console.WriteLine("The average is: " & avg)

'Output: The average is: #.# (where #.# is the calculated average)
