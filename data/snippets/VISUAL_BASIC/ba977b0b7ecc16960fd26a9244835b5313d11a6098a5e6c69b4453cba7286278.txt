' This subroutine calculates the factorial of a given number

Sub CalculateFactorial(ByVal num As Integer, ByRef result As Long)
    ' Initialize result to 1
    result = 1
    
    ' Loop through each number from 1 to num
    For i = 1 To num
        ' Multiply current result by current number
        result = result * i
    Next i
    
    ' Output result
    Debug.Print "Factorial of " & num & " is " & result

' Example usage
Dim num As Integer
Dim result As Long

num = 5 ' Input number
CalculateFactorial num, result ' Call subroutine
' Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
