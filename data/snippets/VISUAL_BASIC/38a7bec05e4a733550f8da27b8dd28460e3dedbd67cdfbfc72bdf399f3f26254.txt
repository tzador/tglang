' This subroutine calculates the sum of all elements in a given array
Sub CalculateSum(arr As Variant)

' Declare variables
Dim i As Integer    ' Loop counter
Dim sum As Double   ' Stores the sum of array elements
Dim n As Integer    ' Length of array

' Determine the length of the array
n = UBound(arr)

' Initialize the sum variable to zero
sum = 0

' Loop through each element in the array
For i = 0 To n
    
    ' Add the current element to the sum
    sum = sum + arr(i)
    
Next i

' Print the sum
Debug.Print "The sum is: "; sum

' Example usage
Sub Main()

' Declare and initialize an array with 5 elements
Dim myArr(4) As Integer
myArr(0) = 1
myArr(1) = 2
myArr(2) = 3
myArr(3) = 4
