' This program calculates the factorial of a given number
Option Explicit ' ensures all variables are declared
Dim num, fact As Long ' declare variables for number and factorial
Dim i As Integer ' declare counter variable
num = 6 ' assign value to number variable
fact = 1 ' initialize factorial variable to 1
For i = 1 To num ' loop from 1 to the given number
fact = fact * i ' multiply current factorial with counter
Next i ' continue loop until counter reaches number value
MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & fact ' display factorial in message box
' Output: The factorial of 6 is 720
