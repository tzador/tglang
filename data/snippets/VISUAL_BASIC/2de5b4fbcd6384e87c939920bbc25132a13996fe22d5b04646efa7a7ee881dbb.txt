' Example of a complex code snippet in Visual Basic

' Declare the variables
Dim num1 As Integer, num2 As Integer, num3 As Integer 
Dim result As Double

' Assign values to the variables
num1 = 5
num2 = 10
num3 = 15

' Perform a series of calculations
result = (num1 * num2 + num3) / (num1 + num2)

' Print the result
Console.WriteLine("The result is: " + result) 

' Create a loop to repeat the calculations
Do While num1 < 100
    result = (num1 * num2 + num3) / (num1 + num2)
    Console.WriteLine("The new result is: " + result)
    num1 = num1 + 1
Loop

' Declare and initialize an array
Dim myArray As Integer() = New Integer(2) {5, 10, 15}

' Use a for loop to iterate through the array and perform calculations
For i As Integer = 0 To 2
    result = (myArray(i) * num2 + num3) / (myArray(i) + num2)
    Console.WriteLine("The result for element " + i.ToString() + " is: " + result)
Next

' Use a select case statement to perform different calculations based on a condition
Select Case result
    Case < 10
        Console.WriteLine("The result is less than 10")
    Case >= 10 And < 20
        Console.WriteLine("The result is between 10 and 20")
    Case > 20
        Console.WriteLine("The result is greater than 20")
End Select
