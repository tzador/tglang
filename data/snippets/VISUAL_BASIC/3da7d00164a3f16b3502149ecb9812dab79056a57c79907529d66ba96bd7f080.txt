'The output of this code snippet will be:

'Size: 2000.5
'Rooms: 3
'Amenities:

'- Gym
'- Movie Theater

'Villa 2:
'Address: 456 Broadway Avenue

'Explanation:
'In this code snippet, we first define a structure named Villa that represents a villa property with properties such as address, size, rooms, and amenities. Then, in the Main method, we create three instances of Villa and set their properties accordingly. Finally, we print out the information about each villa using Console.WriteLine and a for loop to iterate through the amenities array.
