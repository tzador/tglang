' This code snippet is a complex sorting algorithm implemented in Visual Basic. It is used to sort an array of numbers in ascending order.
' The variable 'array' represents the unsorted array of numbers, and the variable 'length' represents the length of the array.
Dim temp As Integer ' temporary variable to store intermediate values

' Loop through the array using nested For loops
For i = 0 To length - 1 ' Outer loop to iterate through each element of the array
    For j = i + 1 To length - 1 ' Inner loop to compare current element with remaining elements
        If array(i) > array(j) Then ' Check if current element is larger than the one being compared
            ' Swap the elements if condition is met
            temp = array(i) ' Store current element in temporary variable
            array(i) = array(j) ' Replace current element with smaller element
            array(j) = temp ' Replace smaller element with stored larger element
        End If
    Next j
Next i

' Print out the sorted array
For k = 0 To length - 1 ' Loop through the array
    Console.WriteLine(array(k)) ' Print each element on a new line
Next k
