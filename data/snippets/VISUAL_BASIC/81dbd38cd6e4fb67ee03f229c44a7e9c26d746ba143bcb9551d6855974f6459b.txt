' This is a simple program written in Visual Basic that prompts the user for their name and outputs a greeting message with their name.
' The following code snippet includes declaring variables, getting user input, and concatenating strings.

Option Explicit ' explicitly declares all variables
Dim firstName As String ' declares a string variable for first name
Dim lastName As String ' declares a string variable for last name

' prompts user for their first name
Console.Write("Enter your first name: ")
firstName = Console.ReadLine() ' stores user input in the firstName variable

' prompts user for their last name
Console.Write("Enter your last name: ")
lastName = Console.ReadLine() ' stores user input in the lastName variable

' concatenates the first and last name with a greeting message
Console.WriteLine("Hello " & firstName & " " & lastName & "! Welcome to Visual Basic.")

' outputs a message with the length of the user's full name
Console.WriteLine("Your name has " & (firstName.Length + lastName.Length) & " characters.")

' outputs a message with the reversed order of the user's names
Console.WriteLine("In reverse, your name is " & StrReverse(lastName) & " " & StrReverse(firstName) & ".")

' outputs a message with the first letter of each name capitalized
Console.WriteLine("In title case, your name is " & StrConv(firstName, vbProperCase) & " " & StrConv(lastName, vbProperCase) & ".")

' outputs a message with the user's initials
Console.WriteLine("Your initials are " & firstName.Substring(0, 1) & "." & lastName.Substring(0, 1) & ".")

' outputs a message with the user's last name in all uppercase
Console.WriteLine("In all caps, your last name is " & lastName.ToUpper())

' outputs a message with the user's first name in all lowercase
Console.WriteLine("In all lowercase, your first name is " & firstName.ToLower())
