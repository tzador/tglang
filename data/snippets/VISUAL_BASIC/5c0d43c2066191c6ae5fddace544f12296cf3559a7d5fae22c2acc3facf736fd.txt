' This code snippet is a Fibonacci sequence generator in Visual Basic
Dim firstNumber As Integer = 0 ' initializing the first number in the sequence
Dim secondNumber As Integer = 1 ' initializing the second number in the sequence
Dim nextNumber As Integer ' variable to store the next number in the sequence

For i As Integer = 0 To 10 ' loop to generate the first 10 numbers in the sequence
    If i <= 1 Then ' if the loop index is less than or equal to 1, the numbers are already initialized
        nextNumber = i
    Else ' if the loop index is greater than 1, the next number is generated by adding the previous two numbers
        nextNumber = firstNumber + secondNumber
        firstNumber = secondNumber ' updating firstNumber to be the previous secondNumber
        secondNumber = nextNumber ' updating secondNumber to be the nextNumber
    End If
    Console.WriteLine(nextNumber) ' printing the next number in the sequence
Next
' Output:
' 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
