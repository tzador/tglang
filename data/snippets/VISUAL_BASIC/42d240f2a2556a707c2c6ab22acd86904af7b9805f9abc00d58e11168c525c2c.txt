' This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to 10 numbers

Dim num1 As Long ' variable to store first number
Dim num2 As Long ' variable to store second number
Dim sum As Long ' variable to store sum of last two numbers
Dim count As Integer ' variable to count up to 10 numbers

num1 = 0 ' initialize first number to 0
num2 = 1 ' initialize second number to 1

' print first two numbers in Fibonacci sequence
Console.WriteLine("1st term: " & num1)
Console.WriteLine("2nd term: " & num2)

While count < 8 ' loop until 10 numbers are reached
    count += 1 ' increment count by 1
    sum = num1 + num2 ' calculate sum of last two numbers
    num1 = num2 ' move second number to first position
    num2 = sum ' set second number to sum of last two numbers
    Console.WriteLine(count + 2 & "th term: " & sum) ' print term and sum
End While
