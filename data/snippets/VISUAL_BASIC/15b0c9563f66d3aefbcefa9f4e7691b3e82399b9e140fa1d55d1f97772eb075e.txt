' This code snippet is an example of a function that calculates the factorial of a number
' It takes in a single parameter, num, which is the number to calculate the factorial of
Function Factorial(ByVal num As Integer) As Integer
    ' Check if the number is less than or equal to 1, if so, return 1
    If num <= 1 Then
        Return 1
    Else
        ' Initialize a variable to hold the result, starting at 1
        Dim result As Integer = 1
        ' Loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number
        For i As Integer = 1 To num
            ' Multiply the result by the current number
            result = result * i
        Next
        ' Return the final result
        Return result
    End If
End Function
