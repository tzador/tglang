' Sample snippet in VISUAL_BASIC
'
' This program calculates the area of a circle, given its radius.

Option Explicit ' Enforces declaration of all variables

Module AreaCalculation
    Sub Main()
        Dim radius As Double ' Variable to store input radius
        Dim area As Double ' Variable to store calculated area
        Dim pi As Double ' Constant for pi value

        pi = 3.14159 ' Assigns pi value to constant

        Console.WriteLine("Enter the radius of the circle: ") ' Prompts user for input
        radius = Console.ReadLine() ' Gets user input and assigns it to radius

        area = pi * radius * radius ' Calculates area using formula

        Console.WriteLine("The area of the circle is: " & area) ' Prints the calculated area
        Console.ReadLine() ' Keeps the program open until user presses any key
    End Sub
