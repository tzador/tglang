' This program calculates and displays the average of a list of numbers

' Creating variables for the list of numbers, sum, and average
Dim numList As Integer() = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Dim sum As Integer
Dim avg As Double

' Looping through the list of numbers and adding them together
For i As Integer = 0 To numList.Length - 1
    sum += numList(i)
Next

' Calculating the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list
avg = sum / numList.Length

' Displaying the average to the user
Console.WriteLine("The average is: " & avg)

' Output:
' The average is: 3
