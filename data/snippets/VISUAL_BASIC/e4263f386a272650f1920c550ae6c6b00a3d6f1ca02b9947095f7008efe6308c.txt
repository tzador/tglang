' This program calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function

' Define a function named Factorial that takes in a number as its argument
' Recursive functions call themselves, so within the function we will call Factorial again
Function Factorial(ByVal num As Integer) As Integer
	Dim result As Integer

	' Base case: if the number is 0 or 1, return 1
	If num = 0 Or num = 1 Then
		result = 1
	Else
		' Recursive case: call the Factorial function again with num-1 as the argument
		result = num * Factorial(num - 1)
	End If

	' Return the result of the factorial calculation
	Return result
End Function

' Ask the user to enter a number
Console.WriteLine("Enter a number to calculate its factorial:")
Dim num As Integer = Console.ReadLine()

' Call the Factorial function and store the result in a variable
Dim factorial As Integer = Factorial(num)

' Display the result to the user
Console.WriteLine("The factorial of " & num & " is " & factorial)

' Output:
' Enter a number to calculate its factorial:
' 5
' The factorial of 5 is 120
