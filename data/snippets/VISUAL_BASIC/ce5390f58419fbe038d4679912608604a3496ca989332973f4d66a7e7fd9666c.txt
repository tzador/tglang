'This is a code snippet in VISUAL_BASIC

'First, we declare our variables
Dim i As Integer 'used for our loop counter
Dim x As Integer 'used for our first number
Dim y As Integer 'used for our second number
Dim z As Integer 'used for our result

'Start of our loop
For i = 1 To 10
    'Prompt the user for their first number
    x = InputBox("Enter first number:")
    'Prompt the user for their second number
    y = InputBox("Enter second number:")

    'Calculate the sum and print the result
    z = x + y
    MsgBox("The sum of " & x & " and " & y & " is: " & z)

    'Check if the result is even or odd and print the corresponding message
    If z Mod 2 = 0 Then
        MsgBox(z & " is an even number.")
    Else
        MsgBox(z & " is an odd number.")
    End If

Next i 'end of loop
'End of code snippet.
