''' This program calculates the average of a list of numbers

' Define a function to calculate average
Function CalculateAverage(numbers() As Double) As Double
    Dim total As Double ' Variable to store the total sum
    Dim average As Double ' Variable to store the calculated average
    For Each num In numbers ' Loop through the list of numbers
        total = total + num ' Add each number to the total sum
    Next num
    average = total / UBound(numbers) ' Calculate average by dividing total sum by number of elements in the list
    CalculateAverage = average ' Return the calculated average
End Function

' Define a sub to take input and output results
Sub Main()
    Dim numbers(5) As Double ' Create an array for 5 numbers
    Dim i As Integer ' Counter variable
    Dim result As Double ' Variable to store the calculated average
    ' Prompt user to enter 5 numbers
    For i = 0 To 4
        numbers(i) = InputBox("Enter number " & (i + 1))
    Next i
    result = CalculateAverage(numbers) ' Call the function to calculate average
    ' Output the results
    MsgBox "The average of the numbers entered is " & result
End Sub

' Call the main sub
