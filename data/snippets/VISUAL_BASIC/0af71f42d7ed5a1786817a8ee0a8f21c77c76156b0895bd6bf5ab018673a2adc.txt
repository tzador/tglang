'This is a code snippet in Visual Basic language
'In this snippet, we will create a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

     input = Console.ReadLine() 'read input from user
     
     'call the function and assign the return value to result variable
     result = Factorial(input) 
     
     'print the result

'function to calculate factorial using recursion
Function Factorial(ByVal num As Integer) As Integer
    'if number is 0 or 1, return 1 as their factorial
    If num = 0 Or num = 1 Then
         Return 1
    'if number is greater than 1, call the function recursively to calculate factorial
    Else
