' This code snippet generates a random 8-character password
' using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
' and numbers.

' Import the required libraries
Imports System
Imports System.Text

' Define the length of the password
Const passwordLength As Integer = 8

' Create an array of possible characters to be included in the password
Dim chars As Char() = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890".ToCharArray()

' Create a StringBuilder object to store the password
Dim passwordBuilder As New StringBuilder()

' Create a Random object to generate random numbers
Dim rng As New Random()

' Loop through the length of the password, adding random characters to the StringBuilder
For i As Integer = 0 To passwordLength - 1
    ' Generate a random index to select a character from the array
    Dim index As Integer = rng.Next(0, chars.Length)

    ' Append the selected character to the StringBuilder
    passwordBuilder.Append(chars(index))
Next

' Convert the StringBuilder to a string and output the password
Console.WriteLine("Generated Password: " & passwordBuilder.ToString())

' Output:
' Generated Password: F8q6Yp2r
