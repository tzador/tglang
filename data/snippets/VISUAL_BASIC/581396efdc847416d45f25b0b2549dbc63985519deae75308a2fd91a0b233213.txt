' This program calculates the factorial of a given number

' Define a variable to hold user input
Dim userInput As Integer

' Get user input for the number
userInput = InputBox("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: ")

' Initialize a variable to hold the factorial value
Dim factorial As Integer = 1

' Create a for loop to iterate from 1 to the user input
For i As Integer = 1 To userInput
    ' Multiply the current value of factorial with the value of i
    factorial = factorial * i
Next

' Output the factorial value to the user
Console.WriteLine($"The factorial of {userInput} is {factorial}")
