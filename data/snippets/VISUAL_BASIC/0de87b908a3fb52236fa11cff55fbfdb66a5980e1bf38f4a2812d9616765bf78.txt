'This is a complex code snippet in Visual Basic
'First, we declare a variable of type string and assign a value
Dim message As String = "Hello, world!"

'Next, we declare a function with two parameters and a return value
Public Function AddNumbers(ByVal num1 As Integer, ByVal num2 As Integer) As Integer

    'In this function, we check if both parameters are even numbers
    If num1 Mod 2 = 0 And num2 Mod 2 = 0 Then
        
        'If both numbers are even, we add them together and return the value
        Return num1 + num2
    Else
        
        'If one or both numbers are odd, we display a message and return -1
        Console.WriteLine("Cannot add odd numbers.")
        Return -1
    End If
    
End Function

'Next, we create an instance of the form class
Dim frm As New Form

'In the form's load event, we set the form title and the label's text
Private Sub frm_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load

    frm.Text = "My Form" 'set the form's title
    lblMessage.Text = message 'set the label's text to the value of the message variable
    
End Sub

'Finally, we call the AddNumbers function with two arguments and store the result in a variable
Dim result As Integer = AddNumbers(2, 4)

'The result will be displayed in a message box
MsgBox(result)

'The output will be 6, since 2 and 4 are both even numbers and are added together.
