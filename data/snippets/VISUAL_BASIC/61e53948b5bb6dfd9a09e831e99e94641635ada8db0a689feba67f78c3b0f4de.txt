' This code is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
' It uses recursion to find the factorial value

Function Factorial(ByVal num As Integer) As Long

    If num = 0 Or num = 1 Then ' Check if number is 0 or 1, return 1 as factorial value
        Factorial = 1
    Else ' If number is greater than 1, use recursion to find factorial value
        Factorial = num * Factorial(num - 1)
    End If

End Function

' Main program to test the Factorial function

Sub Main()

    Dim userInput As Integer ' Variable to store user input
    Dim result As Long ' Variable to store factorial value

    Console.WriteLine("Enter a number to find its factorial:")
    userInput = Console.ReadLine() ' Get user input

    result = Factorial(userInput) ' Call the Factorial function with user input as argument

    Console.WriteLine("Factorial of " & userInput & " is " & result) ' Display factorial value

End Sub

' Output:
' Enter a number to find its factorial:
' 5
' Factorial of 5 is 120
