' This code calculates and prints the mean and standard deviation of a given set of numbers

' Declare variables and arrays
Dim numbers(10) As Double ' Array to store the numbers
Dim sum As Double ' Variable to store the sum of numbers
Dim mean As Double ' Variable to store the mean
Dim stdDev As Double ' Variable to store the standard deviation
Dim n As Integer ' Variable to store the number of elements in the array

' Set n to the size of the array
n = numbers.Length

' User input for numbers
For i = 0 To n - 1 ' Loop from 0 to n-1
    Console.Write("Enter number " & i + 1 & ": ")
    numbers(i) = Console.ReadLine() ' Store user input in array
    sum = sum + numbers(i) ' Add each number to the sum
Next

' Calculate mean
mean = sum / n

' Calculate standard deviation
For j = 0 To n - 1 ' Loop from 0 to n-1
    stdDev = stdDev + (numbers(j) - mean) ^ 2 ' Sum of squares of differences from the mean
Next
stdDev = Math.Sqrt(stdDev / (n - 1))

' Print results to console
Console.WriteLine("Mean: " & mean)
Console.WriteLine("Standard deviation: " & stdDev)

' Output:
' Enter number 1: 5
' Enter number 2: 4
' Enter number 3: 7
' Enter number 4: 12
' Enter number 5: 10
' Enter number 6: 9
' Enter number 7: 6
' Enter number 8: 8
' Enter number 9: 3
' Enter number 10: 1

' Mean: 6.5
' Standard deviation: 3.08007213793412
