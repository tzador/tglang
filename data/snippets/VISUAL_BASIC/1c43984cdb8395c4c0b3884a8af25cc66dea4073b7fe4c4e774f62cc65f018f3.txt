' This code snippet will calculate the factorial of a given number using a recursive function.

' Create a function named "factorial" that takes in a number as a parameter and returns an integer.
Function factorial(ByVal num As Integer) As Integer
	
	' Check if the given number is equal to 0, if so, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1.
	If num = 0 Then
		Return 1
	Else
		' If the given number is not 0, use recursion to call the factorial function again with the number decremented by 1.
		Return num * factorial(num - 1)
	End If
	
End Function

' Prompt the user to enter a number.
Console.WriteLine("Enter a number: ")

' Read the user's input and convert it to an integer.
Dim n As Integer = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine())

' Call the factorial function and store the result in a variable.
Dim result As Integer = factorial(n)

' Display the result to the user.
Console.WriteLine("Factorial of " & n & " is: " & result)

' Output: `Enter a number: 
' 5
' Factorial of 5 is: 120`
