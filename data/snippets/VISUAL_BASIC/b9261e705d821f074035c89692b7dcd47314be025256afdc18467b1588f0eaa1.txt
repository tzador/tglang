' This code snippet generates the first 20 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

Dim firstNumber As Integer = 0            ' declare first number in sequence
Dim secondNumber As Integer = 1           ' declare second number in sequence
Dim currentNumber As Integer = 1          ' declare current number variable

Console.WriteLine(firstNumber)            ' print first number in sequence

For i = 1 To 19                           ' loop 19 times to generate 20 numbers
    Console.WriteLine(currentNumber)      ' print current number in sequence
    currentNumber = firstNumber + secondNumber        ' calculate next number in sequence by adding previous two
    firstNumber = secondNumber                       ' update first number to be previous second number
    secondNumber = currentNumber                     ' update second number to be current number
Next i                                    ' end loop
