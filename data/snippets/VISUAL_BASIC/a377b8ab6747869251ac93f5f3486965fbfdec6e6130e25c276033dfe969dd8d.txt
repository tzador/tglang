' This is a complex code snippet in Visual Basic

' It includes conditional statements, loops, and functions

' Declaring variables and assigning values
Dim x As Integer = 5
Dim y As Integer = 10

' Checks if x is less than y
If x < y Then
    ' Loop to print numbers from 1 to 10
    For i As Integer = 1 To 10
        ' Prints the current number
        Console.WriteLine(i)
        ' Checks if the number is even
        If i Mod 2 = 0 Then
            ' Prints a message if the number is even
            Console.WriteLine("This number is even.")
        Else
            ' Prints a message if the number is odd
            Console.WriteLine("This number is odd.")
        End If

' Function to calculate the factorial of a number
Function Factorial(number As Integer) As Integer
    ' Initializing the result variable
    Dim result As Integer = 1
    ' Loop to multiply the number by each integer before it
    For j As Integer = 1 To number
        result = result * j
    Next
    ' Returns the final result
    Return result
End Function

' Calls the Factorial function and assigns the return value to a variable
Dim factorialResult As Integer = Factorial(5)

' Prints the result
