' This is a program that calculates the factorial of a number 
' and outputs the result in a message box
' Declaring variables
Dim num As Integer ' stores the number whose factorial is to be calculated
Dim factorial As Integer ' stores the factorial of the given number
Dim i As Integer ' used as a counter in the for loop

' Prompting user to enter a number
num = InputBox("Enter a positive integer")

' Validating user input
While num < 0
    ' If the input is negative, prompt user to enter a positive number
    num = InputBox("Please enter a positive integer")
End While

' Initializing factorial to 1, since factorial of 0 is 1
factorial = 1

' Calculating factorial using a for loop
For i = 1 To num
    factorial = factorial * i ' multiply factorial by current value of i
Next i

' Displaying the result in a message box
MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & factorial

' This is the end of the program
