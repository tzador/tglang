'This is a sample code snippet in Visual Basic for a program that calculates the average of three numbers.

'Define variables for three numbers
Dim num1 As Integer
Dim num2 As Integer
Dim num3 As Integer

'Read input from user and assign to variables
num1 = InputBox("Enter first number:")
num2 = InputBox("Enter second number:")
num3 = InputBox("Enter third number:")

'Calculate total sum of the three numbers
Dim sum As Integer
sum = num1 + num2 + num3

'Calculate average by dividing sum by 3
Dim average As Double
average = sum / 3

'Print result to user
MsgBox "The average of the three numbers is: " & average

'Print the largest number
MsgBox "The largest number is: " & Application.WorksheetFunction.Max(num1, num2, num3)

'Print the smallest number
MsgBox "The smallest number is: " & Application.WorksheetFunction.Min(num1, num2, num3)

'Print the range of the numbers
MsgBox "The range of the numbers is: " & Application.WorksheetFunction.Max(num1, num2, num3) - Application.WorksheetFunction.Min(num1, num2, num3)

'Check if two of the numbers are equal
If num1 = num2 Or num1 = num3 Or num2 = num3 Then
    MsgBox "Two of the numbers are equal."
End If

'Check if all three numbers are equal
If num1 = num2 And num1 = num3 Then
    MsgBox "All three numbers are equal."
End If
