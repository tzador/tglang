' This code snippet calculates the volume of a sphere
Dim radius As Double 'Declares a variable for the radius of the sphere
radius = CDbl(InputBox("Enter the radius of the sphere: ")) 'Prompts the user for the radius and converts it to a Double data type

Dim volume As Double 'Declares a variable for the volume of the sphere
volume = 4/3 * Math.PI * radius ^ 3 'Calculates the volume using the formula for a sphere

Console.WriteLine("The volume of the sphere with a radius of " & radius & " is: " & volume) 'Prints the result to the console

' The following code snippet asks the user for the dimensions of a rectangle, calculates the area, and prints the result to the console
Dim length As Double 'Declares a variable for the length of the rectangle
length = CDbl(InputBox("Enter the length of the rectangle: ")) 'Prompts the user for the length and converts it to a Double data type

Dim width As Double 'Declares a variable for the width of the rectangle
width = CDbl(InputBox("Enter the width of the rectangle: ")) 'Prompts the user for the width and converts it to a Double data type

Dim area As Double 'Declares a variable for the area of the rectangle
area = length * width 'Calculates the area using the formula for a rectangle
