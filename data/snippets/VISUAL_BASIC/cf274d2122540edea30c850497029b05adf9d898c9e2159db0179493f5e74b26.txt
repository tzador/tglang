' Prompt user to enter length and width and store the inputs in their respective variables
length = InputBox("Enter the length of the rectangle:")
width = InputBox("Enter the width of the rectangle:")

' Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula A = length * width
Dim area As Double
area = length * width

' Display the result to the user
MsgBox "The area of the rectangle is:" & space(1) & area
