Function Factorial(n As Integer) As Integer 'creates a factorial function that takes in an integer and returns an integer

        Factorial = 1 'if so, returns 1

'example using the factorial function
Dim x As Integer 'declares an integer variable
x = 5 'assigns a value of 5 to x
MsgBox "The factorial of 5 is: " & Factorial(x) 'displays a message box with the factorial of x as the result
