'This is a simple program written in VISUAL_BASIC

'Create variables to store user input
Dim num1 As Integer
Dim num2 As Integer

'Prompt user to enter two numbers
Console.WriteLine("Enter the first number:")
num1 = Console.ReadLine()
Console.WriteLine("Enter the second number:")
num2 = Console.ReadLine()

'Perform arithmetic operations
Dim sum, difference, product, quotient As Integer
sum = num1 + num2
difference = num1 - num2
product = num1 * num2
quotient = num1 \ num2

'Print the results to the console
Console.WriteLine("The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is: " & sum)
Console.WriteLine("The difference between " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is: " & difference)
Console.WriteLine("The product of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is: " & product)
Console.WriteLine("The quotient of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is: " & quotient)
