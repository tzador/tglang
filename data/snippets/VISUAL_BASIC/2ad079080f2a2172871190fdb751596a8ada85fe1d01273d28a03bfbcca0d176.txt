''' This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list

''' Firstly, we declare the function with its name and parameters
Function sumEvenNumbers(numbers As List(Of Integer)) As Integer
    ' Initialize a variable to hold the sum
    Dim sum As Integer = 0
    ' Loop through each number in the list
    For Each num As Integer In numbers
        ' Check if the number is even
        If num Mod 2 = 0 Then
            ' If it is even, add it to the sum
            sum += num
        End If
    Next
    ' Finally, return the sum of even numbers
    Return sum
End Function

''' Now, we create a list with some numbers
Dim numbers As New List(Of Integer)({5, 10, 15, 20, 25})
''' Call the function and store the returned value in a variable
Dim evenSum As Integer = sumEvenNumbers(numbers)
''' Print the result
Console.WriteLine(evenSum)
''' Output: 30
