' This program calculates the factorial of a number
Option Explicit ' forces variable declaration

Dim num As Integer ' declares variable num as integer
Dim factorial As Integer ' declares variable factorial as integer
Dim count As Integer ' declares variable count as integer

Console.Write("Enter a number: ") ' prompts user to enter a number
num = Console.ReadLine() ' reads user input and stores it in num variable

factorial = 1 ' initializes factorial variable to 1

' for loop to calculate factorial
For count = 1 To num ' starts at 1 and loops until the value of num is reached
    factorial = factorial * count ' calculates factorial by multiplying the current factorial value by count
Next count ' continues until loop is completed

Console.WriteLine("The factorial of " & num & " is " & factorial) ' displays the result to the user
