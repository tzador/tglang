'This code snippet demonstrates how to create a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
Sub Main()
    'Declare and initialize a variable to store the input number
    Dim num As Integer = 5

    'Call the factorial function and store the result in a variable
    Dim result As Integer = factorial(num)

    'Print the factorial result to the console
    Console.WriteLine("Factorial of " & num & " is " & result)

    'Wait for user input before closing the program
    Console.ReadLine()
End Sub

'Function to calculate factorial of a given number using recursion
Function factorial(num As Integer) As Integer
    'Base case: if number is 0 or 1, return 1
    If num = 0 Or num = 1 Then
        Return 1
    'Recursive case: calculate factorial by calling the function again with num-1
    Else
        Return num * factorial(num - 1)
    End If
End Function
