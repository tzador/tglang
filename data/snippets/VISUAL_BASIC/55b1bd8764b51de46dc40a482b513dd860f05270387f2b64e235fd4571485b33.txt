'This is a code snippet example in Visual Basic

 'Declaring variables
Dim x, y, z As Integer
 
 'Initializing variables
x = 5
y = 10
 
 'Performing addition and storing the result in z
z = x + y
 
 'Printing the result
Console.WriteLine("The sum of x and y is: " & z)

'Creating a function
Function CalculateAverage(numbers As Integer())
    Dim sum As Integer = 0
    Dim count As Integer = 0
    
    'Looping through the array and calculating the sum
    For Each num In numbers
        sum += num
        count += 1
    Next
    
    'Calculating the average and returning the result
    CalculateAverage = sum / count
End Function

'Initializing an array of numbers
Dim numbers As Integer() = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}

'Calling the function and storing the result in a variable
Dim result As Double = CalculateAverage(numbers)

'Printing the result
Console.WriteLine("The average of the numbers is: " & result)
