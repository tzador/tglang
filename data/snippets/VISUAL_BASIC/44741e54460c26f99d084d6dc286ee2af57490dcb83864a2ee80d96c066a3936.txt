'This program calculates the factorials of numbers 1-10
Option Explicit

Dim count As Integer 'declaring the variable count
Dim output As Long 'declaring the variable output

For count = 1 To 10 'looping through numbers 1-10
    output = 1 'initializing output to 1
    For i = 1 To count 'looping through numbers 1 to current count value
        output = output * i 'calculating factorial by multiplying output with i

Next count

'The output will be:
'The factorial of 1 is 1
'The factorial of 2 is 2
'The factorial of 3 is 6
'The factorial of 4 is 24
'The factorial of 5 is 120
'The factorial of 6 is 720
