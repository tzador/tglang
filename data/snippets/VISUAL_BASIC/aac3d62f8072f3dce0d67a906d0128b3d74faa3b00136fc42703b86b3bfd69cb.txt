' This program calculates the area of a circle
' and the volume of a cone using user input

Option Explicit ' Forces all variables to be declared before use

' Declare and initialize variables
Dim radius As Double
Dim area As Double
Dim height As Double
Dim volume As Double

' User inputs radius
radius = InputBox("Enter the radius of the circle in inches")

' Calculating area of circle
area = 3.14159 * radius * radius

' User inputs height
height = InputBox("Enter the height of the cone in inches")

' Calculating volume of cone
volume = 1 / 3 * 3.14159 * radius * radius * height

' Output the results to the user
MsgBox "The area of the circle is " & area & " square inches."
MsgBox "The volume of the cone is " & volume & " cubic inches."
