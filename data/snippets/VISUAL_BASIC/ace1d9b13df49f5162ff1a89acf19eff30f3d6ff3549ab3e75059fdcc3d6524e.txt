''' This code snippet is a function that takes in a list of numbers, 
    calculates the sum and returns the average of the list. '''

Function calculate_average(numList)

    Dim sum As Double, average As Double   'declare variables for sum and average
    sum = 0                                'initialize sum to 0
    For i = 0 To UBound(numList)           'loop through the list
        sum = sum + numList(i)             'add current value to sum
    Next i                                 'go to next item in the list
    average = sum / (UBound(numList) + 1)  'calculate average by dividing sum by number of items in the list
    calculate_average = average            'return average as the output of the function

End Function

''' Example call of the function with a list of numbers from 1 to 10 '''
''' Output: 5.5 '''
