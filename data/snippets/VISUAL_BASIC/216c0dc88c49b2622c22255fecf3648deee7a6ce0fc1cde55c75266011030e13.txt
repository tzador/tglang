' This code snippet performs a simple sorting algorithm on a given list of numbers

' Initialize an array of numbers to be sorted
Dim numbers As Integer() = {5, 2, 1, 8, 4}

' Set the size of the array
Dim arraySize As Integer = numbers.Length

' Loop through each element in the array
For i As Integer = 0 To arraySize - 1

    ' Store the value of the current element
    Dim currentValue As Integer = numbers(i)

    ' Initialize a variable to store the index of the minimum value
    Dim minIndex As Integer = i

    ' Loop through the remaining elements in the array
    For j As Integer = i + 1 To arraySize - 1

        ' Check if the current element is smaller than the minimum value
        If numbers(j) < numbers(minIndex) Then

            ' Update the index of the minimum value
            minIndex = j
        End If
    Next

    ' Swap the values of the current element and the minimum value
    numbers(i) = numbers(minIndex)
    numbers(minIndex) = currentValue
Next

' Print out the sorted array
Console.WriteLine("Sorted Array:")
For Each number As Integer In numbers
    Console.WriteLine(number)
Next
