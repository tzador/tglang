' This code snippet demonstrates the use of variables, loops, and conditional statements in Visual Basic.

Dim num As Integer ' creating a variable to store an integer value
Dim i As Integer ' creating a loop counter variable
Dim str As String ' creating a variable to store a string value

' user input
num = InputBox("Enter a number:") ' asking the user to enter a number and storing it in the 'num' variable

' looping through numbers from 1 to the user inputted number
For i = 1 To num
    If i Mod 2 = 0 Then ' checking if the number is even
        str = "even" ' storing the string "even" in the 'str' variable
    Else
        str = "odd" ' storing the string "odd" in the 'str' variable
    End If
    
    ' displaying the current number and its "even" or "odd" status
    Debug.Print "Number " & i & " is " & str
Next i

' output
' Number 1 is odd
' Number 2 is even
' Number 3 is odd
' Number 4 is even
' and so on...
