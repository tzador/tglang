' This code snippet creates a program that takes in a list of numbers from the user and calculates their average
Module Module1 ' create a new module
    Sub Main() ' create a subroutine
        Dim numList() As Integer ' create an array to store the numbers
        Dim sum As Integer = 0 ' initialize sum variable to 0
        Dim avg As Double ' create an empty variable to store the average
        Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of elements: ") ' prompt the user to enter the number of elements
        Dim numElements As Integer = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()) ' read and store the number of elements entered by the user
        ReDim numList(numElements - 1) ' resize the array to accommodate the user's input
        For i As Integer = 0 To numElements - 1 ' loop through each element in the array
            Console.WriteLine("Enter element {0}: ", i + 1) ' prompt the user to enter the element
            numList(i) = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()) ' read and store the element in the array
            sum += numList(i) ' add the element to the sum variable
        Next
        avg = sum / numElements ' calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements
        Console.WriteLine("The average is {0}", avg) ' display the average to the user
        Console.ReadLine() ' wait for user input before exiting the program
    End Sub
