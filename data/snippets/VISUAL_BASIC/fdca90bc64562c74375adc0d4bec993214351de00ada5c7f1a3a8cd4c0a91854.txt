' This code snippet will generate a Fibonacci sequence and output the results in a message box on a Visual Basic form

' Define variables for sequence length and starting numbers
Dim length As Integer
Dim num1 As Integer
Dim num2 As Integer

' Prompt user for input
length = InputBox("Enter the length of the sequence:")
num1 = InputBox("Enter the first number:")
num2 = InputBox("Enter the second number:")

' Initialize array for storing sequence numbers
Dim sequence(length - 1) As Integer

' Populate array with first two numbers
sequence(0) = num1
sequence(1) = num2

' Use a loop to generate the rest of the numbers in the sequence
For i As Integer = 2 To length - 1
    sequence(i) = sequence(i - 1) + sequence(i - 2)
Next

' Generate output message
Dim output As String = "The first " & length & " numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are:"

For Each num As Integer In sequence
    output = output & " " & num
Next

' Display output in a message box
MsgBox(output)

' Output:
' The first 'length' numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 (up to desired length)
