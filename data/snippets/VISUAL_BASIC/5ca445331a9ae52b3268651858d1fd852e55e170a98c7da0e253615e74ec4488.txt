' This code snippet is a complex function in VISUAL_BASIC for finding prime numbers

' Function to find prime numbers within a given range
Function findPrimes(ByVal startNum As Integer, ByVal endNum As Integer) As List(Of Integer)

    ' Initializing an empty list to store prime numbers
    Dim primes As New List(Of Integer)

    ' Looping through all the numbers in the given range
    For i As Integer = startNum To endNum

        ' Assuming the number is prime to begin with
        Dim isPrime As Boolean = True

        ' Checking for divisibility by numbers from 2 to the number itself
        For j As Integer = 2 To i
            If i <> j And i Mod j = 0 Then
                ' If the number is divisible by any number other than itself, it is not prime
                isPrime = False
                Exit For
            End If
        Next

        ' If the number is still prime after the inner loop, add it to the list
        If isPrime Then
            primes.Add(i)
        End If
    Next

    ' Returning the list of prime numbers
    Return primes
End Function

' Calling the function and printing the results
Dim start As Integer = 1
Dim end As Integer = 100
Dim result As List(Of Integer) = findPrimes(start, end)
Console.WriteLine("The prime numbers between " & start & " and " & end & " are: ")
For Each num As Integer In result
    Console.Write(num & " ")
Next

' Output:
' The prime numbers between 1 and 100 are:
' 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97
