' This is a simple program in VISUAL_BASIC
' The program will calculate the sum of two numbers entered by the user

' Declare variables to store the numbers
Dim num1 As Integer
Dim num2 As Integer

' Prompt the user to enter the first number
Console.WriteLine("Enter the first number:")
num1 = Console.ReadLine()

' Prompt the user to enter the second number
Console.WriteLine("Enter the second number:")
num2 = Console.ReadLine()

' Calculate the sum of the two numbers
Dim sum As Integer = num1 + num2

' Display the result to the user
Console.WriteLine("The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}", num1, num2, sum)

' Wait for user to press any key before exiting
Console.ReadKey()
