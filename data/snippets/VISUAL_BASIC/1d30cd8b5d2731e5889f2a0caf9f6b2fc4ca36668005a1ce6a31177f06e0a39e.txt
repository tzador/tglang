' This code snippet is a complex loop that counts every other number from 1 to 100

Dim i As Integer ' declare a variable i of type Integer
Dim j As Integer ' declare a variable j of type Integer

' loop through numbers 1 to 100
For i = 1 To 100
    If i Mod 2 = 0 Then ' check if i is an even number
        j = j + i ' add i to j
    End If
Next i ' continue to next iteration

Console.WriteLine("The sum of every other number from 1 to 100 is: " & j) ' print the sum of every other number to the console
