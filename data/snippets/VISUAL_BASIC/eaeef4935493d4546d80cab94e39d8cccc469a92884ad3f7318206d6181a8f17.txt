' This program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

' Declare a function to calculate factorial
Function Factorial(number As Integer) As Long
    ' Check for base case
    If number = 0 Then
        ' Return 1 when number is 0
        Factorial = 1
        Exit Function
    End If
    ' Call the function recursively
    Factorial = number * Factorial(number - 1)
End Function

' Declare a variable to store the user input
Dim num As Integer

' Get input from user
Console.WriteLine("Enter a number to calculate its factorial:")
num = CInt(Console.ReadLine())

' Call the Factorial function and store the result
Dim result As Long = Factorial(num)

' Print the result
Console.WriteLine("The factorial of " & num & " is " & result & ".")

' Output:
' Enter a number to calculate its factorial:
' 5
' The factorial of 5 is 120.
