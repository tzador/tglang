'Define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
Function Factorial(num)
'Initialize the variable to hold the factorial result
Dim result As Integer
'Set initial value of result to 1
result = 1
'Loop through the numbers from 1 to the given number
For i = 1 To num
'Set result equal to result multiplied by the current number
result = result * i
Next i
'Return the factorial result
Factorial = result
End Function

'Call the Factorial function and display the result
MsgBox "The factorial of 5 is: " & Factorial(5)
'Output: The factorial of 5 is: 120
