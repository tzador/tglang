' This code demonstrates a bubble sort algorithm in Visual Basic
' First, define the array to be sorted
Dim myArray As Integer() = {5, 3, 9, 2, 8, 1, 7, 4, 6}

' Next, define the variables needed for the sorting process
Dim temp As Integer
Dim i As Integer
Dim j As Integer

' Start a loop to compare and swap elements in the array
For i = 0 To myArray.Length - 2 ' Loop through all elements except the last one
    For j = 0 To myArray.Length - i - 2 ' Loop through all remaining unsorted elements
        If myArray(j) > myArray(j + 1) Then ' Compare adjacent elements
            ' Swap the elements if the first is larger than the second
            temp = myArray(j)
            myArray(j) = myArray(j + 1)
            myArray(j + 1) = temp
        End If
    Next
Next

' Display the sorted array
Console.WriteLine("Sorted array:")
For Each element As Integer In myArray
    Console.Write(element & " ")
Next

' Output: Sorted array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
