REM  This code snippet demonstrates the use of arrays and functions in Visual Basic.

' Create an array of 10 integers
Dim myArray(9) As Integer

' Fill the array with random numbers
For i = 0 To 9
    myArray(i) = Int((100 * Rnd) + 1)
Next i

' Print out the contents of the array
Console.WriteLine("Array contents:")
For Each num In myArray
    Console.WriteLine(num)
Next

' Create a function to calculate the average of the array elements
Function CalculateAverage(arr() As Integer) As Double
    Dim sum As Integer = 0
    For Each val In arr
        sum += val
    Next
    CalculateAverage = sum / arr.Length
End Function

' Call the function and print out the average
Console.WriteLine("Average of the array elements: " & CalculateAverage(myArray))
