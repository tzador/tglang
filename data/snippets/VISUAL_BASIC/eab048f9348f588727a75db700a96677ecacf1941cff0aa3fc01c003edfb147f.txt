' This program calculates the factorial of a given number.
'
' Define a function named "Factorial" that takes in a parameter "num".
Function Factorial(ByVal num As Integer) As Integer
    Dim result As Integer
    result = 1

    ' Use a For Loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to the given number.
    For i As Integer = 1 To num
        ' Multiply the current result by the current number.
        result = result * i
    Next
    
    ' Return the final result.
    Return result
End Function

' In the main function, prompt the user for a number to calculate the factorial of.
Dim userInput As Integer
Console.WriteLine("Enter a number:")
userInput = Console.ReadLine()

' Call the Factorial function and pass in the user's input as the parameter.
Dim factorialResult As Integer
factorialResult = Factorial(userInput)

' Print the result to the console.
Console.WriteLine($"The factorial of {userInput} is {factorialResult}")

' Output:
' Enter a number:
' 5
' The factorial of 5 is 120
