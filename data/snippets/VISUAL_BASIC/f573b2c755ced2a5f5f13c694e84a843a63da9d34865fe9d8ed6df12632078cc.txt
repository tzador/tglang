' This is a program that calculates the area of a circle

Option Explicit ' Ensures all variables are declared before use

Const PI As Double = 3.14159 ' Sets the value of PI for use in calculations

' Prompt user for input
Dim radius As Double ' Declares a variable for the radius
radius = Val(InputBox("Enter the radius of the circle:")) 'Prompts user to enter the radius
'Val function converts user input to a number

' Calculate area of the circle
Dim area As Double ' Declares a variable for the area
area = PI * (radius ^ 2) ' Calculates the area using the formula PI * r^2

' Display the result
MsgBox "The area of the circle with radius " & radius & " is " & area ' Displays the calculated area in a message box
' & is used for string concatenation
