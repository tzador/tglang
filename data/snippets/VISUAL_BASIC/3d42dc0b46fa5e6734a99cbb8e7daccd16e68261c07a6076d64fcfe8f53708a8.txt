' This code snippet is a function for calculating the factorial of a number.
' It uses a recursive approach.
' The function takes in a number as an argument and returns the factorial value.
' Syntax: Factorial(number)

Function Factorial(ByVal num As Integer) As Long
    If num = 0 Then ' Base case, factorial of 0 is 1
        Factorial = 1
    Else
        Factorial = num * Factorial(num - 1) ' Recursive call to calculate factorial
    End If
End Function

' Sample usage and output
Dim num As Integer
num = 5
MsgBox "Factorial of " & num & " is " & Factorial(num) ' Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
