'''Code to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion'''
Function factorial(ByVal num As Integer) As Integer 'defines function to calculate factorial of a number
    If num = 0 Then 'checks if number is 0
        factorial = 1 'returns 1 if number is 0
    Else
        factorial = num * factorial(num - 1) 'recursive call to calculate factorial
    End If
End Function

Dim number As Integer 'declares variable for input number
Dim answer As Integer 'declares variable for factorial result
Console.Write("Enter a number: ") 'prompts user to enter a number
number = Console.Read() 'reads user input and assigns it to variable
answer = factorial(number) 'calls factorial function to calculate factorial of input number
Console.WriteLine("The factorial of " & number & " is: " & answer) 'displays the result to user
