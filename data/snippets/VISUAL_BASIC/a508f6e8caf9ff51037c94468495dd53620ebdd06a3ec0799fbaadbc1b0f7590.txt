'This code is a simple program that calculates the sum of two numbers'
'My first variable stores the first number'
Dim x As Integer
'My second variable stores the second number'
Dim y As Integer
'My third variable stores the sum of the two numbers'
Dim sum As Integer

'This function takes in two numbers and returns their sum'
Function CalculateSum(x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer
    'This line adds the two numbers and stores the result in the sum variable'
    sum = x + y
    'The function then returns the sum'
    Return sum
End Function

'Here, I prompt the user to enter the first number'
Console.WriteLine("Enter the first number:")
'My first input variable stores the user's input'
Dim input1 As String
input1 = Console.ReadLine()
'Here, I convert the input to an integer and assign it to the x variable'
x = CInt(input1)

'Next, I prompt the user to enter the second number'
Console.WriteLine("Enter the second number:")
'My second input variable stores the user's input'
Dim input2 As String
input2 = Console.ReadLine()
'Here, I convert the input to an integer and assign it to the y variable'
y = CInt(input2)

'Now, I call the CalculateSum function with the values of x and y'
sum = CalculateSum(x, y)

'Finally, I display the result to the user'
Console.WriteLine("The sum of " & x & " and " & y & " is " & sum)

'Output: The sum of [first number] and [second number] is [sum]'
