' This is a basic program that calculates the average of three numbers

' Declare variables to hold the three numbers
Dim num1, num2, num3 As Integer

' Assign values to the variables using input boxes
num1 = InputBox("Enter the first number:")
num2 = InputBox("Enter the second number:")
num3 = InputBox("Enter the third number:")

' Calculate the average by adding the three numbers and dividing by 3
Dim average As Double
average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3

' Print the average to the screen using a message box
MsgBox("The average of " & num1 & ", " & num2 & ", and " & num3 & " is " & average)
