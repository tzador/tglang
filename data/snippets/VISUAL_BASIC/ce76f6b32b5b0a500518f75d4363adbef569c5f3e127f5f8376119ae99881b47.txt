' This code snippet is a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.
Module Factorial ' define a module called Factorial
    Sub Main() ' define a sub procedure named Main
        Dim num As Integer ' declare variable num as an integer
        Dim fact As Integer ' declare variable fact as an integer
        fact = 1 ' initialize fact to 1
        ' prompt user for input
        Console.Write("Enter a number: ")
        ' store user input in variable num
        num = Console.ReadLine()
        For i = 1 To num ' loop from 1 to the given number
            ' multiply fact by the current value of i
            fact = fact * i
        Next ' move on to next value of i
        ' print the result
        Console.WriteLine("Factorial of " & num & " is " & fact)
        ' pause the program before closing the console window
        Console.ReadKey()
    End Sub ' end of sub procedure Main
End Module ' end of module Factorial
