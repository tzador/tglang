' This code snippet is a program for implementing a binary search algorithm
' The program asks the user to enter a sorted array and a target number to search for
' It then performs the binary search algorithm and returns the index of the target number if found, -1 if not found.

Option Explicit ' Explicitly declare all variables

Public Function BinarySearch(arr As Variant, target As Integer) As Integer ' Function to perform binary search
    Dim low As Integer: low = 0 ' Initialize low variable to first index of array
    Dim high As Integer: high = UBound(arr) ' Initialize high variable to last index of array
    Dim mid As Integer ' Declare mid variable to store middle index of array
    Dim found As Boolean: found = False ' Flag to indicate whether target number is found
    Dim index As Integer ' Index variable to store index of target number if found

    Do While low <= high And Not found ' Continue looping until target number is found or all elements are checked
        mid = (low + high) \ 2 ' Calculate middle index of array
        If arr(mid) = target Then ' If target number is found
            found = True ' Set found flag to true
            index = mid ' Store index of target number
        ElseIf arr(mid) < target Then ' If target number is greater than middle element
            low = mid + 1 ' Move low variable to next index in array
        Else ' If target number is smaller than middle element
            high = mid - 1 ' Move high variable to previous index in array
        End If
    Loop

    If found Then ' If target number is found
        BinarySearch = index ' Set function return value to index of target number
    Else ' If target number is not found
        BinarySearch = -1 ' Set function return value to -1
    End If
