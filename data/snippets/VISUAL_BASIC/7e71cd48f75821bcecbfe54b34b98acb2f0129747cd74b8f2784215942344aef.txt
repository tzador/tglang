' This code snippet is for sorting an array using the bubble sort algorithm
' We start by declaring the array to be sorted
Dim arr() As Integer = {5, 2, 8, 1, 3}

' Next, we declare some variables and initialize them
Dim temp As Integer ' This will be used for swapping values
Dim i As Integer ' This will be used as a loop counter
Dim j As Integer ' This will be used to compare values

' Now, we create a for loop to iterate through the array
For i = 0 To arr.Length - 2 ' -2 to ensure we don't go out of bounds
    For j = 0 To arr.Length - 2 - i ' -2 and -i to reduce the loop iterations
        ' Compare adjacent elements and swap if necessary
        If arr(j) > arr(j + 1) Then
            temp = arr(j)
            arr(j) = arr(j + 1)
            arr(j + 1) = temp
        End If
    Next j
Next i

' Finally, we print the sorted array
For i = 0 To arr.Length - 1
    Console.Write(arr(i) & " ")
Next i
