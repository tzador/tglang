' This code snippet calculates the mean of a given array of integers and returns the result.
' The array can contain any number of elements, but must be non-empty and only contain integers.

' Declares and initializes the array with sample values
Dim arr(5) As Integer
arr = {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42}

' Calculates the sum of all elements in the array
Dim sum As Integer
For Each num As Integer In arr
    sum += num
Next

' Calculates the number of elements in the array
Dim count As Integer
count = arr.Length

' Calculates the mean by dividing the sum by the count
Dim mean As Double
mean = sum / count

' Prints the mean to the console
Console.WriteLine("The mean of the array is: " & mean)

' Outputs: The mean of the array is: 16.3333333333333
