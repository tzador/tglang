' This code snippet will calculate and output the average of three numbers using a loop
' Create three variables to store the input numbers
Dim num1 As Integer
Dim num2 As Integer
Dim num3 As Integer

' Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in the first variable
Console.WriteLine("Enter the first number: ")
num1 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine())

' Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in the second variable
Console.WriteLine("Enter the second number: ")
num2 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine())

' Prompt the user to enter the third number and store it in the third variable
Console.WriteLine("Enter the third number: ")
num3 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine())

' Initialize a counter variable and a sum variable
Dim counter As Integer = 0
Dim sum As Integer = 0

' Use a loop to add each number to the sum and increment the counter
For i = 1 To 3
    sum += i
    counter += 1
Next

' Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the counter
Dim average As Double = sum / counter

' Output the average with a message
Console.WriteLine("The average of " & num1 & ", " & num2 & ", and " & num3 & " is: " & average)
