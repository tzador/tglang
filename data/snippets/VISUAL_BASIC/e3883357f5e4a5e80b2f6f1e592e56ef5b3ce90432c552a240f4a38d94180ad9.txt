' This code snippet demonstrates a simple calculator program in Visual Basic
Option Explicit ' ensures all variables are declared before use

Sub Main()

    Dim num1 As Double ' declare variable for first number
    Dim num2 As Double ' declare variable for second number
    Dim operator As String ' declare variable for operator
    Dim result As Double ' declare variable for result

    Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the calculator program!") ' print welcome message to console

    Console.WriteLine("Please enter the first number:")
    num1 = Console.ReadLine() ' store user input for first number

    Console.WriteLine("Please enter the second number:")
    num2 = Console.ReadLine() ' store user input for second number

    Console.WriteLine("Please enter an operator (+, -, *, /):")
    operator = Console.ReadLine() ' store user input for operator

    Select Case operator ' evaluate operator using a Select Case statement
        Case "+" ' if operator is addition
            result = num1 + num2 ' perform addition operation
        Case "-" ' if operator is subtraction
            result = num1 - num2 ' perform subtraction operation
        Case "*" ' if operator is multiplication
            result = num1 * num2 ' perform multiplication operation
        Case "/" ' if operator is division
            result = num1 / num2 ' perform division operation
        Case Else ' if operator is not recognized or invalid
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid operator entered. Please try again.")
    End Select

    Console.WriteLine("The result is: " & result) ' print result to console

    Console.ReadLine() ' pause program so results can be viewed before exiting
