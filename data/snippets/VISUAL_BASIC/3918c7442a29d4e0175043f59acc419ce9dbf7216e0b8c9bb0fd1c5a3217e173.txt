' This is a code snippet in Visual Basic for a program that calculates the area of a triangle
' The user will input the base and height of the triangle and the program will output the calculated area


' Declare variables for base, height, and area
Dim base As Double
Dim height As Double
Dim area As Double

' Prompt user to input base of triangle
Console.Write("Enter the base of the triangle: ")

' Read user's input and store it in the base variable
base = CDbl(Console.ReadLine())

' Prompt user to input height of triangle
Console.Write("Enter the height of the triangle: ")

' Read user's input and store it in the height variable
height = CDbl(Console.ReadLine())

' Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula (base * height)/2
area = (base * height) / 2

' Output the result to the user
Console.WriteLine("The area of the triangle is: " & area)

' End the program
Console.ReadLine()
