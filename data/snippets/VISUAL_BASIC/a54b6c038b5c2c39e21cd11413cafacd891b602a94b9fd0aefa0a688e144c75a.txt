' This code snippet is a program that calculates the average of a set of numbers

Public Sub Main()
    Dim count As Integer ' variable to store the number of numbers entered
    Dim total As Double ' variable to store the sum of the numbers entered
    Dim average As Double ' variable to store the average of the numbers entered
    Dim input As String ' variable to store the user's input
    
    Console.WriteLine("How many numbers do you want to enter? ") ' prompts the user to enter the number of numbers
    input = Console.ReadLine() ' reads the input from the user
    count = CInt(input) ' converts the input to an integer and assigns it to the count variable
    
    If count <= 0 Then ' checks if the count is a valid number
        Console.WriteLine("Invalid input. Please enter a positive number.") ' prints an error message and terminates the program
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    For i As Integer = 1 To count ' loop that runs from 1 to the value of count
        Console.WriteLine("Enter number " & i) ' prompts the user to enter a number
        input = Console.ReadLine() ' reads the input from the user
        total += CDbl(input) ' converts the input to a double and adds it to the total variable
    Next
    
    average = total / count ' calculates the average by dividing the total by count
    Console.WriteLine("The average is: " & average) ' prints the average to the console
End Sub
