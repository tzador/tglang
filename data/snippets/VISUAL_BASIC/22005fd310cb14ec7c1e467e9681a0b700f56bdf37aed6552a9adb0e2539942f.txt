' This program calculates the sine and cosine of a given angle
Dim angle As Double ' variable to store the angle
Dim result As Double ' variable to store the result
Dim sin As Double ' variable to store the sine
Dim cos As Double ' variable to store the cosine

angle = 30 ' set angle to 30 degrees

' calculate sine
sin = Sin(angle) ' built-in function to calculate the sine
' calculate cosine
cos = Cos(angle) ' built-in function to calculate the cosine

' display results
Console.WriteLine("The sine of " & angle & " degrees is " & sin)
Console.WriteLine("The cosine of " & angle & " degrees is " & cos)

' pause program so results can be viewed
Console.ReadLine()
