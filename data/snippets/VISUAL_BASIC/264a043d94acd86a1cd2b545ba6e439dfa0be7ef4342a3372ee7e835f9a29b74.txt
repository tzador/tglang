' This is a complex code snippet in Visual Basic.
' It contains a function, a loop, and several conditional statements.
' The function takes in two parameters, num1 and num2, and returns their sum.
' The loop iterates until the value of num1 reaches 10.
' Each iteration, a conditional statement checks if the value of num1 is divisible by 2 or 5 and prints a corresponding message.

Function calculateSum(ByRef num1 As Integer, ByRef num2 As Integer) As Integer
    ' Initialize variable to store the sum
    Dim sum As Integer = 0
   
    ' Loop until num1 reaches 10
    Do While num1 < 10
        ' Check if num1 is divisible by 2
        If num1 Mod 2 = 0 Then
            ' Print message
            Console.WriteLine("Num1 is divisible by 2")
        End If
        
        ' Check if num1 is divisible by 5
        If num1 Mod 5 = 0 Then
            ' Print message
            Console.WriteLine("Num1 is divisible by 5")
        End If
        
        ' Add num1 and num2 to the sum
        sum += num1 + num2
        
        ' Increment num1 by 1
        num1 += 1
    Loop
    
    ' Return the sum
    Return sum
End Function

' Call the function with num1 = 1 and num2 = 2
Dim result As Integer = calculateSum(1, 2)

' Print the result
Console.WriteLine("The sum is: " & result)
