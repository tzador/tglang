' This code snippet is a program that calculates the area of a circle using the user's input for the radius.
Option Explicit ' This enforces the declaration of variables before use
Dim radius As Double ' This declares the variable for radius as a double data type
Dim area As Double ' This declares the variable for area as a double data type
Const pi = 3.14159265358979 ' This assigns the value of pi to a constant, which is used in the area calculation
Console.WriteLine("Enter the radius of the circle:") ' This prompts the user to enter the radius
radius = Console.ReadLine() ' This reads the user's input and assigns it to the radius variable
area = pi * radius * radius ' This calculates the area using the formula pi * r^2 and assigns it to the area variable
Console.WriteLine("The area of the circle is: " & area) ' This prints the calculated area to the console
Console.ReadLine() ' This waits for the user to press enter before exiting the program
