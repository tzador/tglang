'Define variables
Dim arrNumbers(10) As Integer 'an array of 10 integers
Dim total As Integer 'variable to store total
Dim average As Double 'variable to store average

'Loop to populate array with random numbers
For i = 0 To 10
    arrNumbers(i) = Int((100 - 1 + 1) * Rnd + 1) 'generate random number between 1 and 100
Next i

'Loop to calculate sum of all numbers in array
For j = LBound(arrNumbers) To UBound(arrNumbers)
    total = total + arrNumbers(j) 'add each number to total
Next j

'Calculate average
average = total / UBound(arrNumbers)

'Print the original array and the average
Debug.Print "Original array: " & Join(arrNumbers, ", ") 'join array elements into a string separated by commas
Debug.Print "Average: " & average
