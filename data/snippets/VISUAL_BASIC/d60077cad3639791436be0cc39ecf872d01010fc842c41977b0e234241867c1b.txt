' This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
' Function to calculate factorial recursively
Function Factorial(n As Integer) As Integer
' Base case: if number is 0 or 1, factorial is 1
If (n = 0 Or n = 1) Then
    Factorial = 1
Else
    ' Recursive call to calculate factorial
    Factorial = n * Factorial(n - 1)
End If
End Function

' Main code
Sub Main()
' Input number from user
Dim num As Integer
Console.WriteLine("Enter a number:")
num = Console.ReadLine()
' Call function to calculate factorial
Dim result As Integer
result = Factorial(num)
' Output the result
Console.WriteLine("Factorial of " & num & " is " & result)
