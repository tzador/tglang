' This code snippet is a program that calculates and prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
Sub Fibonacci()
    Dim n1 As Integer, n2 As Integer, n3 As Integer, count As Integer
    n1 = 0
    n2 = 1

    'First two numbers of the sequence are hardcoded as 0 and 1
    Console.Write(n1 & " " & n2) 'Prints the first 2 numbers
    While (count < 10) 'Loops until the count reaches 10
        n3 = n1 + n2 'Calculates the next number in the sequence
        Console.Write(" " & n3) 'Prints the number
        n1 = n2 'Updates the values of n1 and n2
        n2 = n3
        count = count + 1 'Increments the count by 1
