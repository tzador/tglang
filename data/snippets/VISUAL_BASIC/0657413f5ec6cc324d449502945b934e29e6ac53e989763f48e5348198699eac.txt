' This is a complex code snippet in Visual Basic.

' Define a function that takes in two parameters - num1 and num2, and returns their sum.
Function getSum(num1 As Integer, num2 As Integer) As Integer
   ' Use the "ByVal" keyword to pass the parameters by value.
   ' This means that the original variables outside the function will not be modified.
   ' The function will perform its operations on copies of the variables.
   
   ' Use variables to store the result and the intermediate steps.
   Dim result As Integer
   ' The "Dim" keyword is used to declare variables in Visual Basic.
   ' It stands for "Dimension" and is followed by the variable name and its data type.
   Dim intermediateStep1 As Integer
   Dim intermediateStep2 As Integer
   
   ' Assign the first parameter to the "intermediateStep1" variable.
   intermediateStep1 = num1
   ' Assign the second parameter to the "intermediateStep2" variable.
   intermediateStep2 = num2
   
   ' Perform the operation.
   result = intermediateStep1 + intermediateStep2
   
   ' Return the result.
   ' Use the "return" statement followed by the value to be returned.
   ' In this case, we return the "result" variable.
   Return result
End Function

' Call the function and store the returned value in a variable.
' Use the "as" keyword to specify the data type of the variable.
Dim sum As Integer
sum = getSum(5, 10)

' Display the result to the user.
' Use the "MsgBox" function to display a message box with the specified string.
' In this case, we concatenate the result variable with a string using the "&" operator.
MsgBox "The sum is: " & sum

' Output:
' The sum is: 15
