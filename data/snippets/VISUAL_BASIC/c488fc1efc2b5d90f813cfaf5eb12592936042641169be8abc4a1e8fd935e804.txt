' This code snippet uses Visual Basic to calculate the factorial of a given number

' Define a function named 'factorial' that takes in a parameter 'n'
Function factorial(n As Integer) As Integer
    Dim result As Integer ' Create a variable to store final result
    result = 1 ' Set initial value of result to 1

    ' Loop through all values from 1 to n
    For i = 1 To n 
        result = result * i ' Multiply result by current loop value
    Next i ' Go to next loop iteration

    ' Return the final result
    factorial = result 
End Function ' End function definition

' Declare and initialize a variable 'num' to store the number whose factorial is to be calculated
Dim num As Integer = 6 

' Call the 'factorial' function and store the returned value in 'result' variable
Dim result As Integer = factorial(num) 

' Print the result to the console
Console.WriteLine("The factorial of " & num & " is " & result)
