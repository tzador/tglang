' This code snippet calculates the volume of a cube using the user's input for the length, width and height

' Declare variables for length, width and height
Dim length As Double
Dim width As Double 
Dim height As Double

' Prompt user for input and store values in variables
length = InputBox("Enter length of cube:")
width = InputBox("Enter width of cube:")
height = InputBox("Enter height of cube:")

' Calculate volume using formula
volume = length * width * height

' Display the calculated volume to the user
MsgBox "The volume of the cube is: " & volume & " units cubed."
