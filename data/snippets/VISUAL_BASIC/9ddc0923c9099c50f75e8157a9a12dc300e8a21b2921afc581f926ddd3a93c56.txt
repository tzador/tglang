' This program calculates the BMI of a person.

Option Explicit ' ensures that variables are declared before use

Sub Main() ' declares the main sub routine

    ' declares variables
    Dim height As Double ' stores height in meters
    Dim weight As Double ' stores weight in kilograms
    Dim bmi As Double ' stores calculated bmi

    ' prompts user to input height in meters
    Console.Write("Enter height in meters: ")
    height = Console.ReadLine() ' reads user input and assigns it to height variable

    ' prompts user to input weight in kilograms
    Console.Write("Enter weight in kilograms: ")
    weight = Console.ReadLine() ' reads user input and assigns it to weight variable

    ' calculates bmi using the formula bmi = weight / (height^2)
    bmi = weight / (height ^ 2)

    ' prints the calculated bmi with two decimal places
    Console.WriteLine("BMI: " & Format(bmi, "0.00"))

    ' checks if bmi is within healthy range
    If (bmi >= 18.5 And bmi <= 25) Then
        ' prints message
        Console.WriteLine("You have a healthy BMI!")
    ElseIf (bmi < 18.5) Then
        ' prints message
        Console.WriteLine("You are underweight!")
    Else
        ' prints message
        Console.WriteLine("You are overweight!")
    End If

End Sub ' ends the main sub routine

' sample output:

' Enter height in meters: 1.65
' Enter weight in kilograms: 55.5
' BMI: 20.41
' You have a healthy BMI!
