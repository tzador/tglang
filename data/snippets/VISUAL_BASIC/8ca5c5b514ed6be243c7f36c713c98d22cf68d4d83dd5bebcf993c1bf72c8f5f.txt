' This is a long and complex code snippet in Visual Basic.
'
' It includes multiple functions, variables, and loops.
'
' Please note that this is just an example and may not actually execute as it is.
'
' First, we define a function to calculate the factorial of a number, using recursion.
Function Factorial(num As Integer) As Integer
    If num = 0 Then
        Factorial = 1
    Else
        Factorial = num * Factorial(num - 1)
    End If
End Function

' Then, we declare a variable to store the result of the factorial.
Dim result As Integer

' Next, we prompt the user for a number and store it in a variable.
Console.Write("Enter a number: ")
Dim input As Integer = Console.ReadLine()

' Now, we call the Factorial function and pass in the user's input.
result = Factorial(input)

' We then print the result to the console.
Console.WriteLine("The factorial of " & input & " is: " & result)

' Next, we create a loop to print a pattern of numbers, using nested loops.
For i = 1 To 5
    For j = 1 To i
        Console.Write(j) ' Prints the number
    Next j
    Console.WriteLine() ' Moves to the next line
Next i

' Finally, we use a do-while loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence and print it to the console.
Dim fib1 As Integer = 0 ' First number in sequence
Dim fib2 As Integer = 1 ' Second number in sequence
Dim fib3 As Integer ' To store the next number in sequence

Console.Write(fib1 & " " & fib2 & " ") ' Prints the first two numbers

Do While fib3 < 100 ' Loop until the number exceeds 100
    fib3 = fib1 + fib2 ' Calculate next number in sequence
    Console.Write(fib3 & " ") ' Prints the number
    fib1 = fib2 ' Shift numbers in sequence
    fib2 = fib3
Loop

' Output:
'
' The factorial of <user input> is: <factorial result>
' 1
' 12
' 123
' 1234
' 12345
' 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89
