'* This is a program in Visual Basic that will generate a random
'* Fibonacci sequence and print out the results.

'* Define variables
Dim firstNum As Integer = 0
Dim secondNum As Integer = 1
Dim nextNum As Integer
Dim count As Integer = 0

'* Ask user for input
Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers you want to generate:")
Dim numToGenerate As Integer = Console.ReadLine()

'* Generate and print Fibonacci sequence
Console.WriteLine("The Fibonacci sequence is:")
While count < numToGenerate
    If count <= 1 Then
        nextNum = count
    Else
        nextNum = firstNum + secondNum
        firstNum = secondNum
        secondNum = nextNum
    End If
    Console.Write(nextNum & " ") ' Prints current number in sequence
    count += 1 ' Increments count
End While

'* Output:
'Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers you want to generate:
'10
'The Fibonacci sequence is:
'0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
