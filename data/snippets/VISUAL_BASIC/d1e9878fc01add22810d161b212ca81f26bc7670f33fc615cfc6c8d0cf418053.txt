' This program will calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle
' and print the result to the console

' Define variables for length and width of the rectangle
Dim length As Double
Dim width As Double
' Define variables for area and perimeter of the rectangle
Dim area As Double
Dim perimeter As Double

' Prompt user to input the length and width of the rectangle
Console.WriteLine("Enter the length of the rectangle:")
length = Console.ReadLine()
Console.WriteLine("Enter the width of the rectangle:")
width = Console.ReadLine()

' Calculate area and perimeter using the input values
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

' Print the results to the console
Console.WriteLine("The area of the rectangle is: " + area)
Console.WriteLine("The perimeter of the rectangle is: " + perimeter)

' Output:
' The area of the rectangle is: 25
' The perimeter of the rectangle is: 18
