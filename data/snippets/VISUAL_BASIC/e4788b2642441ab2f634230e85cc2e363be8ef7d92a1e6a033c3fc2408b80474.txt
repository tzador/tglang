'This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number

'Create a variable to store the input number
Dim inputNumber As Integer

'Prompt the user to enter a number
Console.WriteLine("Enter a number:")

'Get the input from user and store it in the inputNumber variable
inputNumber = Console.ReadLine()

'Create a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to the input number
For i As Integer = 1 To inputNumber
    'Create a variable to store the factorial result
    Dim factorial As Integer = 1
    'Create a for loop to calculate the factorial
    For j As Integer = 1 To i
        'Multiply the current factorial result by the current number in the loop
        factorial = factorial * j
    Next
    'Print the factorial for each number in the loop
    Console.WriteLine("The factorial of " & i & " is: " & factorial)
