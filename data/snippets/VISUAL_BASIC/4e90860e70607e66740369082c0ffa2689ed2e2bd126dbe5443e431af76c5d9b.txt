'Below is an example of a function that calculates the factorial of a number.
Function Factorial(num As Integer) As Integer
    If num <= 1 Then
        'Base case, return 1 when num is 0 or 1.
        Factorial = 1
    Else
        'Recursive call to the Factorial function.
        Factorial = num * Factorial(num - 1)
    End If
End Function

'Example usage of the Factorial function.
Dim result As Integer
result = Factorial(5) 'Calling the function and storing the result in the variable 'result'.
MsgBox "The factorial of 5 is " & result 'Display the result in a message box.
