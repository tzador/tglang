' This code snippet is a program that asks the user for a number and then checks if it is a prime number or not.

Module Module1 ' Start of module

    Sub Main() ' Main subroutine

        Dim num As Integer ' Declaration of variable to store user input
        Dim isPrime As Boolean = True ' Boolean variable to track if number is prime or not

        Console.WriteLine("Enter a number: ") ' Asks user to enter a number
        num = Console.ReadLine() ' Reads and stores user input

        For i = 2 To num / 2 ' For loop to iterate through all possible factors of the number
            If num Mod i = 0 Then ' If statement to check if the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself
                isPrime = False ' If the condition is met, the number is not prime
                Exit For ' Exits the for loop
            End If
        Next

        If isPrime = True Then ' If condition to check if the number is still prime
            Console.WriteLine(num & " is a prime number.") ' If the condition is met, the number is prime
        Else ' Else statement if number is not prime
            Console.WriteLine(num & " is not a prime number.") ' If the condition is not met, the number is not prime
        End If

        Console.ReadLine() ' Keeps the console window open until user presses enter
