' This code snippet demonstrates a function to calculate the sum of all prime numbers between 1 and a given number
' Declare variables that will be used in the function
Dim num As Integer ' represents the given number
Dim i As Integer ' represents the loop counter
Dim sum As Integer ' represents the final sum of prime numbers
Dim prime As Boolean ' represents whether a number is prime or not
 
' Prompt the user to enter a number
Console.WriteLine("Enter a positive integer: ")
num = Console.ReadLine()
 
' Initialize sum to 0
sum = 0
 
' Outer loop to iterate through all numbers between 1 and the given number
For i = 1 To num
    prime = True ' Assume that the number is prime initially
 
    ' Inner loop to check if the current number is prime or not
    For j = 2 To i - 1
        ' If the current number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is not prime
        If i Mod j = 0 Then
            prime = False
            Exit For
        End If
    Next j
 
    ' If the number is prime, add it to the sum
    If prime = True Then
        sum = sum + i
    End If
Next i
 
' Display the final sum of prime numbers
Console.WriteLine("Sum of prime numbers between 1 and " & num & " is " & sum)
