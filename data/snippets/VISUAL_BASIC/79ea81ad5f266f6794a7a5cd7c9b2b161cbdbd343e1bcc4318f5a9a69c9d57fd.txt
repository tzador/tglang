' This program calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle

' Define variables for the length and width of the rectangle
Dim length As Double
Dim width As Double

' Prompt user for input and store values in variables
length = InputBox("Enter the length of the rectangle:", "Rectangle Area Calculator")
width = InputBox("Enter the width of the rectangle:", "Rectangle Area Calculator")

' Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle
Dim area As Double
Dim perimeter As Double
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

' Display the results to the user
MsgBox "The area of the rectangle is " & area & " square units."
