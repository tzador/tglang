' This code snippet demonstrates a complex function that converts a decimal number to a binary number
Function DecimalToBinary(decimal As Integer) As String

    ' Initializing variables
    Dim binary As String = ""
    Dim remainder As Integer

    ' Loop until decimal is equal to 0
    While decimal > 0
        
        ' Calculate the remainder when dividing by 2
        remainder = decimal Mod 2

        ' Append the remainder to the start of the binary string
        binary = remainder & binary

        ' Reduce the decimal number by half
        decimal = decimal \ 2

    End While

    ' Return the binary string
    Return binary

End Function
