' The following code snippet uses a for loop to print the Fibonacci sequence up to 10.

Sub Main()
    Dim num1 As Integer, num2 As Integer, num3 As Integer ' Declare variables for the sequence.
    num1 = 0 ' Initialize first two numbers in the sequence.
    num2 = 1

    For i As Integer = 0 To 10 ' Loop through 10 times.
        num3 = num1 + num2 ' Calculate the next number in the sequence.
        Console.WriteLine(num3) ' Print the number.
        num1 = num2 ' Shift variables to continue the sequence.
        num2 = num3
    Next ' End of for loop.
End Sub
