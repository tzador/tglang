' This is a program that calculates the factorial of a given number
' using a recursive function

' Define the factorial function
Function factorial(n As Integer) As Long
    ' Check if n is equal to 0
    If n = 0 Then
        ' Base case: the factorial of 0 is 1
        factorial = 1
    Else
        ' Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
        factorial = n * factorial(n - 1)
    End If
End Function

' Declare and initialize the input variable
Dim input As Integer
input = 5 ' This can be changed to any desired number

' Call the factorial function and save the result in a variable
Dim result As Long
result = factorial(input)

' Display the result in a message box
MsgBox "The factorial of " & input & " is " & result & "."

' Output:
' The factorial of 5 is 120.
