' This code snippet is a basic calculator program written in Visual Basic.

' The program begins by declaring variables for the first and second numbers to be entered by the user.
Dim num1 As Integer
Dim num2 As Integer

' Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in the "num1" variable.
Console.WriteLine("Enter the first number:")
num1 = Console.ReadLine()

' Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in the "num2" variable.
Console.WriteLine("Enter the second number:")
num2 = Console.ReadLine()

' Declare a variable for the result of the calculation.
Dim result As Integer

' Use a Select Case statement to ask the user to choose the desired operation.
Select Case operation
   Case "1"
      ' If the user enters a 1, the program will perform addition and store the result in the "result" variable.
      result = num1 + num2
   Case "2"
      ' If the user enters a 2, the program will perform subtraction and store the result in the "result" variable.
      result = num1 - num2
   Case "3"
      ' If the user enters a 3, the program will perform multiplication and store the result in the "result" variable.
      result = num1 * num2
   Case "4"
      ' If the user enters a 4, the program will perform division and store the result in the "result" variable.
      result = num1 / num2
   Case Else
      ' If the user enters any other value, the program will display an error message and end.
      Console.WriteLine("Please enter a valid operation.")
      End
End Select

' Display the result to the user.
Console.WriteLine("The result is: " & result)

' End of program.
