' This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the total sales and commission
' for a group of salespeople based on their individual sales figures.
' The commission rates are determined by their total sales.

' Declare variables for the sales amounts and commission rates
Dim salesAmounts(1 To 5) As Double ' array to store sales amounts
Dim commissionRates(1 To 5) As Double ' array to store commission rates
Dim totalSales As Double ' variable to store total sales for all salespeople
Dim totalCommission As Double ' variable to store total commission for all salespeople

' Initialize array values with sample data
salesAmounts(1) = 10000
salesAmounts(2) = 15000
salesAmounts(3) = 20000
salesAmounts(4) = 25000
salesAmounts(5) = 30000

' Calculate the total sales for all salespeople
For i = 1 To 5
    totalSales = totalSales + salesAmounts(i)
Next i

' Determine the commission rates based on total sales
If totalSales < 50000 Then ' less than 50000 total sales
    For i = 1 To 5
        commissionRates(i) = 0.05 ' 5% commission rate
    Next i
ElseIf totalSales < 100000 Then ' between 50000 and 100000 total sales
    For i = 1 To 5
        commissionRates(i) = 0.07 ' 7% commission rate
    Next i
Else ' greater than or equal to 100000 total sales
    For i = 1 To 5
        commissionRates(i) = 0.1 ' 10% commission rate
    Next i
End If

' Calculate the total commission for all salespeople
For i = 1 To 5
    totalCommission = totalCommission + (commissionRates(i) * salesAmounts(i))
Next i

' Display the results
Console.WriteLine("Total Sales: " & totalSales)
For i = 1 To 5
    Console.WriteLine("Salesperson " & i & ": Sales = " & salesAmounts(i) & ", Commission = " & (commissionRates(i) * salesAmounts(i)))
Next i
Console.WriteLine("Total Commission: " & totalCommission)

' Output:
' Total Sales: 100000
' Salesperson 1: Sales = 10000, Commission = 500
' Salesperson 2: Sales = 15000, Commission = 1050
' Salesperson 3: Sales = 20000, Commission = 1400
' Salesperson 4: Sales = 25000, Commission = 1750
' Salesperson 5: Sales = 30000, Commission = 2100
' Total Commission: 6800
