' This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number using recursion
' Define a public function called "fibonacci" that takes in a single argument "n" as an integer
Public Function fibonacci(n As Integer) As Integer
    ' Check if "n" is equal to 0 or 1, which are the first two numbers in the sequence
    If n = 0 Or n = 1 Then
        ' Return the value of "n"
        fibonacci = n
    Else
        ' If "n" is greater than 1, calculate the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence
        fibonacci = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
    End If
End Function

' Define a public sub called "main" for testing the function
Public Sub main()
    ' Set a variable "num" equal to the desired number to calculate up to
    Dim num As Integer
    num = 10
    ' Loop through the sequence starting at 0 and ending at "num"
    For i = 0 To num
        ' Call the "fibonacci" function and pass in the current number in the sequence
        ' Print the result with an annotation showing the current number in the sequence
        ' Note: the result will be indented because it is inside the "main" sub
        Debug.Print "The fibonacci number at position " & i & " is " & fibonacci(i)
    Next i
