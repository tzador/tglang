'This code snippet calculates the average of three numbers

'Variable declarations
Dim num1 As Integer
Dim num2 As Integer
Dim num3 As Integer
Dim total As Integer

'Input values for the three numbers
num1 = 10
num2 = 15
num3 = 20

'Calculate the sum of the three numbers
total = num1 + num2 + num3

'Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 3
Dim average As Double
average = total / 3

'Output the result
Console.WriteLine("The average of the three numbers is: " & average)

'Check if the average is equal to 10
If average = 10 Then
    Console.WriteLine("The average is equal to 10.")
Else
    Console.WriteLine("The average is not equal to 10.")
End If

'Multiply the average by 10 and store in a new variable
Dim multiplied As Double
multiplied = average * 10

'Output the multiplied result
Console.WriteLine("The average multiplied by 10 is: " & multiplied)

'Find the square root of the multiplied average
Dim squareRoot As Double
squareRoot = Math.Sqrt(multiplied)

'Output the square root result
Console.WriteLine("The square root of the multiplied average is: " & squareRoot)

'Check if the square root is less than 5
If squareRoot < 5 Then
    Console.WriteLine("The square root is less than 5.")
Else
    Console.WriteLine("The square root is not less than 5.")
End If

'Calculate the factorial of the first number using a for loop
Dim factorial As Integer
factorial = 1
For i As Integer = 1 To num1
    factorial *= i
Next

'Output the factorial result
Console.WriteLine("The factorial of " & num1 & " is: " & factorial) 

'Calculate the power of the second number using a while loop
Dim power As Integer
Dim counter As Integer = 0
power = 1
While counter <> num2
    power *= 2
    counter += 1
End While

'Output the power result
Console.WriteLine("2 to the power of " & num2 & " is: " & power)

'Create an array with the three numbers
Dim numbersArr(2) As Integer

'Loop through the array and output each number
For i As Integer = 0 To numbersArr.Length - 1

'Calculate the average of the array elements
Dim arrSum As Integer
For i As Integer = 0 To numbersArr.Length - 1
    arrSum += numbersArr(i)
Next
Dim arrAvg As Double
arrAvg = arrSum / numbersArr.Length

'Output the array average
