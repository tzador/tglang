' This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
Option Explicit
' Declare variable for the number whose factorial will be calculated
Dim num As Integer
' Prompt user to enter a number
num = InputBox("Enter a number:")
' Declare variable to store the factorial value
Dim factorial As Integer
' Initialize factorial value to 1
factorial = 1
' Loop through numbers starting from 1 up to the given number
For i = 1 To num
    ' Multiply the current factorial value by the current number in the loop
    factorial = factorial * i
Next
' Output the factorial value
MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & factorial
