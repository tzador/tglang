' This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion 

' Declare a function to calculate factorial
Function Factorial(n As Integer) As Integer

' Base case: if n is 0 or 1 return 1
If n = 0 Or n = 1 Then
    Factorial = 1
Else
    ' Recursive case: call the function again with n-1 and multiply with n
    Factorial = Factorial(n - 1) * n
End If

End Function

' Ask for user input
Dim num As Integer
num = InputBox("Enter a number: ")

' Print the factorial of the input number
MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & Factorial(num)
