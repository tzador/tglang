' This code snippet uses a while loop and conditional statements to print numbers and their square roots
Dim num As Integer ' variable to store numbers
Dim sqrt As Single ' variable to store square roots
num = 10 ' initial value for num

' while loop to iterate over numbers from 10 to 1
While num >= 1
    ' conditional statement to check if number is a perfect square
    If num * num = num Then
        sqrt = num ' if perfect square, square root is the number itself
    Else
        sqrt = Sqr(num) ' if not perfect square, use Sqr function to calculate square root
    End If

    Debug.Print "Number: " & num & " Square Root: " & sqrt ' print number and square root
    num = num - 1 ' decrement num by 1
