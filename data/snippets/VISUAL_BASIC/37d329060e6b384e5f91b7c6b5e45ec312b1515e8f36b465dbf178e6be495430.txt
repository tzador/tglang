' This program calculates the sum of two numbers
Option Explicit ' Enable strict variable declaration
'Step 1: Declare two variables and initialize them with values
Dim num1 As Integer `This variable holds the first number` 
Dim num2 As Integer `This variable holds the second number` 

num1 = 5 'Initialize num1 with the value 5
num2 = 10 'Initialize num2 with the value 10

'Step 2: Calculate the sum of num1 and num2
Dim sum As Integer 'Create a variable to hold the sum

sum = num1 + num2 'Assign the sum of num1 and num2 to the sum variable

'Step 3: Display the result
MsgBox "The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & sum 'Display a message box with the sum of the two numbers

'Step 4: Terminate the program
End 'End of program
