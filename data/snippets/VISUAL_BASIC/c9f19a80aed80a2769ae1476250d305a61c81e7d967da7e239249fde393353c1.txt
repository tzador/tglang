' This code snippet is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
' The function takes in one parameter, the number to calculate the factorial for
' It uses a for loop to iterate through all the numbers from 1 to the given number
' Each iteration, it multiplies the current number by the factorial value and updates the factorial value
Function Factorial(x as Integer) As Integer
    Dim factorialValue As Integer
    factorialValue = 1
    For i = 1 To x
        factorialValue = factorialValue * i
    Next i
    Factorial = factorialValue
End Function
