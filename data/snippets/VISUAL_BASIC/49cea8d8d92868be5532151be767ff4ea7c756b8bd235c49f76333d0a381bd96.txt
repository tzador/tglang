' This code snippet is a visual basic program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

Option Explicit ' Ensures that all variables must be declared before use.

Sub Main() ' Main subroutine

    ' Declare variables
    Dim length As Double ' The length of the rectangle
    Dim width As Double ' The width of the rectangle
    Dim area As Double ' The area of the rectangle
    Dim perimeter As Double ' The perimeter of the rectangle

    ' Prompt user for input
    length = InputBox("Enter the length of the rectangle:") ' Asks the user to enter the length of the rectangle and stores the input in the variable length
    width = InputBox("Enter the width of the rectangle:") ' Asks the user to enter the width of the rectangle and stores the input in the variable width

    ' Calculate area and perimeter
    area = length * width
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

    ' Output results
    MsgBox "The area of the rectangle is: " & area ' Displays the calculated area in a message box
    MsgBox "The perimeter of the rectangle is: " & perimeter ' Displays the calculated perimeter in a message box

End Sub ' End of Main subroutine
