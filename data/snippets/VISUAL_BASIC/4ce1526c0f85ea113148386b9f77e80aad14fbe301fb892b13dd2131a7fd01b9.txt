'This code snippet is written in the Visual Basic programming language
'Since it is a markup language, it is more focused on visual presentation of data
'This particular example showcases a class, a common programming concept

'Create a class called "Employee"
Class Employee
    'Declare all the necessary variables and their data types
    Private firstName As String
    Private lastName As String
    Private employeeID As Integer
    Private salary As Double
    Private department As String

    'Constructor of the class, sets the initial values for the variables
    Public Sub New(ByVal fName As String, ByVal lName As String, ByVal eID As Integer, ByVal sal As Double, ByVal dept As String)
        firstName = fName
        lastName = lName
        employeeID = eID
        salary = sal
        department = dept
    End Sub

    'Method to get the full name of the employee
    Public Function GetFullName() As String
        Return firstName & " " & lastName
    End Function

    'Method to get the annual salary of the employee
    Public Function GetAnnualSalary() As Double
        Return salary * 12
    End Function

    'Method to print all the information of the employee
    Public Sub PrintEmployeeInfo()
        Console.WriteLine("Employee ID: " & employeeID)
        Console.WriteLine("Name: " & GetFullName())
        Console.WriteLine("Department: " & department)
        Console.WriteLine("Monthly Salary: " & FormatCurrency(salary))
        Console.WriteLine("Annual Salary: " & FormatCurrency(GetAnnualSalary()))
    End Sub
End Class

'This is the main module of the program
Module MainModule
    Sub Main()
        'Create an instance of the "Employee" class with the necessary information
        Dim employee1 As New Employee("John", "Smith", 12345, 5000, "Sales")

        'Call the "PrintEmployeeInfo" method to display all the employee information
        employee1.PrintEmployeeInfo()

        'Create another instance of the "Employee" class with different information
        Dim employee2 As New Employee("Jane", "Doe", 54321, 6500, "Marketing")

        'Call the "PrintEmployeeInfo" method for the second employee
