' Start by declaring the necessary variables to store the user input.
Dim name As String
Dim age As Integer

' Prompt the user to enter their name.
Console.WriteLine("Please enter your name:")

' Prompt the user to enter their age.
Console.WriteLine("Please enter your age:")
' Convert the user input to an integer and store it in the age variable.
age = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine())

' Check if the age is less than 18.
If age < 18 Then
    ' If the age is less than 18, display a message stating that the user is not an adult yet.
