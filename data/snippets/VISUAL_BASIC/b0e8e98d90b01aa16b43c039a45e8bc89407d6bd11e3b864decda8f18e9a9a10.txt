' This code snippet is a simulation of a simple game
' The game is called "Guess the Number"
' Player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100
' Player has 10 chances to guess the number
Option Explicit  ' enforce variable declaration

' DECLARE VARIABLES
Dim randomNum As Integer  ' stores randomly generated number
Dim guess As Integer  ' stores player's guess
Dim attempts As Integer  ' stores number of attempts
Dim maxAttempts As Integer  ' maximum number of attempts allowed
Dim playAgain As String  ' stores player's choice to play again or not

' INITIALIZE VARIABLES
randomize  ' generate random number
randomNum = Int((100 * Rnd) + 1)  ' store random number between 1 and 100
attempts = 1  ' initialize number of attempts to 1
maxAttempts = 10  ' maximum number of attempts allowed
