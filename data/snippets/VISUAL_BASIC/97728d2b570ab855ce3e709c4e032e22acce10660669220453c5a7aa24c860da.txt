'This code snippet uses a loop to iterate through a dictionary and print out the key-value pairs.

'Creating a dictionary
Dim fruits As New Dictionary(Of String, String)
fruits.Add("apple", "red")
fruits.Add("banana", "yellow")
fruits.Add("grape", "purple")

'Initializing variables for loop
Dim key As String
Dim value As String

'Loop through dictionary
For Each item In fruits
    'Assigning key and value to variables
    key = item.Key
    value = item.Value
    
    'Printing key-value pairs
    Console.WriteLine("The color of the " & key & " is " & value & ".")
Next

'Output:
'The color of the apple is red.
'The color of the banana is yellow.
'The color of the grape is purple.
