' This code snippet demonstrates how to create a two-dimensional array and loop through its elements
	Dim ArrayName(3,3) As Integer ' declare a two-dimensional array with a size of 3 by 3
    	
    	' use a nested for loop to initialize each element
    	For i = 0 To 3
        	For j = 0 To 3
            	ArrayName(i,j) = i + j ' assign a value to each element based on its position
        	Next j
    	Next i
    	
    	' use a nested for loop to print out each element with its position
   	For i = 0 To 3
        	For j = 0 To 3
            	Console.WriteLine("Element at position " & i & "," & j & " = " & ArrayName(i,j))
        	Next j
    	Next i

' This code snippet also demonstrates the use of conditional statements in Visual Basic
	If ArrayName(0,0) > 5 Then ' check if the element at position (0,0) is greater than 5
    		Console.WriteLine("The value at position (0,0) is greater than 5") ' print a message if the condition is true
    	Else
    		Console.WriteLine("The value at position (0,0) is less than or equal to 5") ' print a message if the condition is false
    	End If

' This code snippet shows how to use a function in Visual Basic
	Function Add(x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer ' declare a function that takes in two integers and returns their sum
    		Return x + y ' return the sum of the two numbers
    	End Function
    	
    	Dim result As Integer ' declare a variable to store the result of calling the function
    	result = Add(5, 3) ' call the function by passing in two values and storing the result in the variable
    	
    	Console.WriteLine("The result of adding 5 and 3 is: " & result) ' print out the result
