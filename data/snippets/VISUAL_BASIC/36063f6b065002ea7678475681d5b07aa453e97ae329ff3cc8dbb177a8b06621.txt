' This code snippet implements a binary search algorithm
' for searching through a sorted array of integers.

' Create a function that takes in the array and the value to search for
Function BinarySearch(arr() As Integer, value As Integer)

    ' Set initial values for the start and end indices of the array
    Dim start As Integer = 0
    Dim [end] As Integer = arr.Length - 1
    
    ' Loop until the start index is greater than the end index
    While (start <= [end])
        
        ' Find the middle index of the array using integer division
        Dim middle As Integer = (start + [end]) / 2
        
        ' If the middle value is equal to the value being searched for,
        ' return the middle index as the result
        If (arr(middle).Equals(value)) Then
            Return middle
        
        ' Otherwise if the middle value is less than the value being searched for,
        ' update the start index to be the middle index plus one
        ElseIf (arr(middle) < value) Then
            start = middle + 1
        
        ' Otherwise, update the end index to be the middle index minus one
        Else
            [end] = middle - 1
        End If
    End While
    
    ' If the value is not found in the array, return -1 as the result
    Return -1
End Function

' Sample usage of the function
Dim arr() As Integer = {1, 4, 6, 8, 10}
Dim index As Integer = BinarySearch(arr, 6) ' returns index 2
