' This code uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number.
' The factorial of a number n is the product of all the numbers from 1 to n, including n.
'
' Example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
'
' We will use a recursive function to calculate the factorial.
' A recursive function is a function that calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem.

Private Function Factorial(ByVal number As Integer) As Integer
' Check for the base case, when the number is 0 or 1
If number = 0 Or number = 1 Then
    Factorial = 1
' If not the base case, recursively call the function with the number-1, until we reach the base case
Else
    Factorial = number * Factorial(number - 1)
End If
End Function

' Test the function by calling it with different numbers
' Expected output: 
' 5! = 120
MsgBox("5! = " & Factorial(5))

' Additional feature: allow the user to input a number and calculate its factorial
Dim num As Integer
num = InputBox("Enter a number:")
MsgBox(num & "! = " & Factorial(num))

' Output:
' User inputs 10
' 10! = 3628800
