' This code is a part of a program that calculates the amount of paint needed to paint a room.

Option Explicit 'This enforces variable declaration, preventing typos.

Dim length As Double 'Declaring the length of the room as a Double data type.
Dim width As Double 'Declaring the width of the room as a Double data type.
Dim height As Double 'Declaring the height of the room as a Double data type.

'Console input for length, width and height of the room by the user.
length = CDbl(InputBox("Please enter the length of the room in feet:"))
width = CDbl(InputBox("Please enter the width of the room in feet:"))
height = CDbl(InputBox("Please enter the height of the room in feet:"))

'Calculating the area of the walls
Dim walls_area As Double 'Declaring a variable to store the area of the walls.
walls_area = 2 * (length + width) * height 'Formula to calculate the area of the walls.

'Calculating the area of the ceiling
Dim ceiling_area As Double 'Declaring a variable to store the area of the ceiling.
ceiling_area = length * width 'Formula to calculate the area of the ceiling.

'Calculating the total area to be painted
Dim total_area As Double 'Declaring a variable to store the total area to be painted.
total_area = walls_area + ceiling_area 'Formula to calculate the total area to be painted.

'Calculating the amount of paint needed
Const PAINT_COVERAGE As Double = 400 'Defining a constant for the paint coverage in square feet per gallon.
Dim paint_needed As Double 'Declaring a variable to store the amount of paint needed.
paint_needed = total_area / PAINT_COVERAGE 'Formula to calculate the amount of paint needed.

'Outputting the result to the user
MsgBox "The total area of the room to be painted is " & total_area & " square feet." & vbCrLf & "You will need " & paint_needed & " gallons of paint to cover the walls and ceiling." 'A message box that displays the total area and amount of paint needed.
