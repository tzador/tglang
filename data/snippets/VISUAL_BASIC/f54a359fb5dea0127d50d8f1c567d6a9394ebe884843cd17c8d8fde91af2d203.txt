' This program will prompt the user to enter three numbers and calculate their average
Dim num1, num2, num3 As Integer ' declare variables to store the three numbers
Dim average As Double ' declare variable to store the calculated average
Console.WriteLine("Enter the first number:") ' prompt the user to enter the first number
num1 = Console.ReadLine() ' read and store the first number input from the user
Console.WriteLine("Enter the second number:") ' prompt the user to enter the second number
num2 = Console.ReadLine() ' read and store the second number input from the user
Console.WriteLine("Enter the third number:") ' prompt the user to enter the third number
num3 = Console.ReadLine() ' read and store the third number input from the user

average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3 ' calculates the average of the three numbers

Console.WriteLine("The average is: " & average) ' displays the average to the console
Console.ReadLine() ' waits for user input to close the console window

' Sample output:
