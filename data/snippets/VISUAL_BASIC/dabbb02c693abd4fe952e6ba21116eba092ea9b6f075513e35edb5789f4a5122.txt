' This code snippet demonstrates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

Function factorial(num As Integer) As Integer
    ' Check for special case of 0
    If num = 0 Then
        factorial = 1
    ' Check for negative numbers
    ElseIf num < 0 Then
        MsgBox "Factorial cannot be determined for negative numbers."
    ' Calculate factorial for positive numbers
    Else
        factorial = 1
        ' Loop through each number from 1 to the given number
        For i = 1 To num
            ' Multiply current factorial by current number
            factorial = factorial * i
        Next
    End If
End Function

' Testing the function with different inputs
MsgBox "The factorial of 3 is: " & factorial(3) ' Output: 6
MsgBox "The factorial of 6 is: " & factorial(6) ' Output: 720
MsgBox "The factorial of 10 is: " & factorial(10) ' Output: 3628800
MsgBox "The factorial of 0 is: " & factorial(0) ' Output: 1
MsgBox "The factorial of -5 is: " & factorial(-5) ' Output: Factorial cannot be determined for negative numbers.
