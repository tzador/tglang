' Declare and initialize an array with values
Dim numbers() As Integer = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

' Create a for loop to iterate through the array
For i = 0 To UBound(numbers)
    ' Print the value of the current index
    Console.WriteLine(numbers(i))
Next

' Create a variable to hold the current sum
Dim totalSum As Integer = 0

' Create a for each loop to iterate through the array
For Each num As Integer In numbers
    ' Add the current value to the total sum
    totalSum += num
Next

' Print the total sum
Console.WriteLine("Total sum: " & totalSum)

' Create a sub procedure to perform addition
Sub Addition()
   ' Declare variables to hold two numbers
   Dim num1 As Integer = 5
   Dim num2 As Integer = 10

   ' Calculate the sum
   Dim sum As Integer = num1 + num2

   ' Print the sum
   Console.WriteLine("The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is: " & sum)
End Sub

' Call the sub procedure
Addition()

' Output:
' 1
' 2
' 3
' 4
' 5
' Total sum: 15
' The sum of 5 and 10 is: 15
