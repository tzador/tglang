'This code snippet creates a function that calculates the average of an array of numbers.
Function CalculateAverage(numbers() As Integer) As Double 'Declares the function and its parameters
    Dim total As Double 'Declares a variable to store the total of all numbers in the array
    For Each num In numbers 'Loops through each number in the array
        total += num 'Adds the current number to the total
    Next
    Dim average As Double 'Declares a variable to store the average
    average = total / UBound(numbers) 'Calculates the average by dividing the total by the number of elements in the array
    Return average 'Returns the average
End Function 'Ends the function declaration

'Example usage of the function
Dim numArray() As Integer = {5, 7, 9, 3, 10} 'Declares an array of numbers
Dim result As Double 'Declares a variable to store the result
result = CalculateAverage(numArray) 'Calls the CalculateAverage function and passes in the array as an argument
MessageBox.Show("The average of the numbers is: " & result) 'Displays a message box with the result
