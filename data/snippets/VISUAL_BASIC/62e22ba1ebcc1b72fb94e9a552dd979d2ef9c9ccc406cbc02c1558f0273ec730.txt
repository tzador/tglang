' This code snippet generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

' prompt user for input
Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of terms to output:")
Dim n As Integer = Console.ReadLine() ' store user input in variable n

' initialize variables to hold previous and current Fibonacci numbers
Dim prev As Integer = 0
Dim curr As Integer = 1

' loop through n number of times
For i As Integer = 0 To n - 1
    Console.WriteLine(curr) ' output current Fibonacci number
    Dim next As Integer = prev + curr ' calculate next Fibonacci number
    prev = curr ' update previous Fibonacci number
    curr = next ' update current Fibonacci number
