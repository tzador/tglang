// This is a code snippet in Apache Groovy
// It is a complex program that calculates the average of an array of numbers
// The input array is defined and initialized
double[] numbers = [5.5, 6.8, 3.2, 1.9, 8.4]
// The length of the array is stored in a variable
int length = numbers.length
// Variable to store the sum of the numbers in the array
double sum = 0
// Loop through the array and sum up the numbers
for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i]
}
// Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the array
double average = sum / length
// Print the calculated average to the console
println "The average of the numbers is: " + average
