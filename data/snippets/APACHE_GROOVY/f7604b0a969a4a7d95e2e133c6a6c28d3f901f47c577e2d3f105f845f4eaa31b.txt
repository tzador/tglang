// This code snippet uses Apache Groovy to perform a Fibonacci sequence calculation

// Function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
int fibonacci(int num) {
    // Set the first two values of the sequence
    int first = 0
    int second = 1
    
    // Initialize an array to store the sequence
    int[] sequence = [first, second]
    
    // Loop through all numbers up to the given number
    for (int i = 2; i < num; i++) {
        // Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
        int next = first + second
        
        // Add the next number to the sequence array
        sequence << next
        
        // Update the values of first and second to be used in the next iteration
        first = second
        second = next
    }
    
    // Return the sequence array
    return sequence
}

// Print out the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
print fibonacci(10)
