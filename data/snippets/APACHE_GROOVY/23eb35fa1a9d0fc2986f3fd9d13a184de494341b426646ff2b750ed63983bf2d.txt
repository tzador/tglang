//This code snippet creates a class called 'Person' with properties 'name' and 'age'
class Person {
    String name
    int age

    //Constructor that takes in a name and age parameter and assigns them to the properties
    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
    }

    //Method to print out the person's name and age
    void printDetails() {
        println("$name is $age years old")
    }
}

//Creating an instance of the 'Person' class
Person person1 = new Person("John", 25)

//Calling the 'printDetails' method on the person1 instance
person1.printDetails()

//Output: John is 25 years old
