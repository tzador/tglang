/*This is a complex code snippet showcasing a Groovy function that calculates the factorial of a given number*/

//Define a function called factorial that takes in one parameter, num
def factorial(num) {
    //Initialize a variable called result with a value of 1
    def result = 1
    //Loop through numbers from 1 up to num
    for(i in 1..num) {
        //Multiply the current value of result with the current value of i and store it in result
        result *= i
    }
    //Return the final value of result
    return result
}

//Call the factorial function with input value of 5 and store the result in a variable called output
def output = factorial(5)

//Print the output to the console
println "5 factorial is: " + output
