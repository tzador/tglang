// This is a complex code snippet in APACHE_GROOVY
// It performs various calculations and operations

// Create a list of numbers
def numbers = [2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15]

// Filter the list to only include even numbers
def evenNumbers = numbers.findAll { it % 2 == 0 }

// Map the list to multiply each number by 3
def multipliedNumbers = numbers.collect { it * 3 }

// Use reduce to find the sum of the list
def sum = numbers.reduce(0) { total, num -> total + num }

// Use any to check if there are any numbers that are divisible by 5
def hasDivisibleByFive = numbers.any { it % 5 == 0 }

// Create a class for a person with properties for name, age, and occupation
class Person {
    String name
    int age

// Use sort to sort the list of people by age in ascending order
