// This code snippet uses Apache Groovy programming language to create a function that calculates the area of a circle given its radius.

// defining a function named "calculateCircleArea" that takes in one parameter, the radius
def calculateCircleArea(radius) {
    // declaring a constant named "PI" and setting its value to 3.14
    final PI = 3.14
    // calculating the area using the formula PI*r^2 and storing it in a variable named "area"
    def area = PI * radius * radius
    // returning the calculated area
    return area
}

// calling the function with a radius of 5 and printing the result
println "The area of a circle with radius 5 is: ${calculateCircleArea(5)}"
