// Defining a Groovy class

// Creating an instance of the Employee class
def emp1 = new Employee("John", 30, ["Java", "Groovy", "SQL"])

// Printing the Employee's information
emp1.printInfo()

// Checking if the Employee has the skill "Groovy" and printing the result
println("Does $emp1.name have the skill Groovy? ${emp1.hasSkill("Groovy")}")

// Output:
John is 30 years old and has skills in [Java, Groovy, SQL]
Does John have the skill Groovy? true
