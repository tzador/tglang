//This code is a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the array.

//Initialization and declaration of array variable
def numbers = [3, 5, 2, 9, 10, 8, 12]

//Function definition
def sumOfEvenNumbers(numbers){
    //Initialize and declare a variable to store the sum of even numbers
    def sum = 0
    //Loop through the array
    for(num in numbers){
        //Check if number is even
        if(num % 2 == 0){
            //Add even number to sum variable
            sum += num
        }
    }
    //Return the sum of even numbers
    return sum
}

//Call the function and pass in the array as an argument
def evenSum = sumOfEvenNumbers(numbers)

//Print the sum of even numbers
println "Sum of even numbers: ${evenSum}"
