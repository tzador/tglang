//This is a complex Groovy code snippet that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

//Function to generate Fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(int n) {
    def fib = [0, 1] //initialize sequence with first two numbers
    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        fib << fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2] //add previous two numbers to generate next number
    }
    return fib //return sequence as a list
}

//Input number
def input = 10

//Call function and store sequence in variable
def sequence = fibonacci(input)

//Print sequence in console
println "Fibonacci sequence up to ${input}:"
println sequence.toString()
