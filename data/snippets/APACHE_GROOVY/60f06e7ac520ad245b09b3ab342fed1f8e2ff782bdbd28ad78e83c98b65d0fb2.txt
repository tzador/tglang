//Creating an instance of the Person class

//Calling the greet method
person.greet() //Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.

//Printing the person's address
person.address.printAddress() //Output: 123 Main St, New York, NY 10001

//Changing the person's address
person.changeAddress(new Person.Address("456 Broadway", "Boston", "MA", "02101"))

//Printing the updated address
person.address.printAddress() //Output: 456 Broadway, Boston, MA 02101
