// This code snippet makes use of closures and the "each" method to iterate through a list and print out each element along with its index

def list = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]

list.each { element, index -> // using the each method to iterate through the list and assigning a closure with two parameters (element and index)
    println "${index}: ${element}" // printing out the index and element with string interpolation
}

// Output:
0: apple
1: banana
2: orange
3: grape
