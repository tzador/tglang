/* This code snippet calculates the average of a list of numbers
and displays the result */

// Define a list of numbers
def numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

// Create a function that calculates the average
def getAverage(list) {
    // Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the numbers
    def sum = 0
    // Loop through the list and add each number to the sum
    for (num in list) {
        sum += num
    }
    // Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list
    def average = sum / list.size()
    // Return the result
    return average
}

// Call the getAverage function and store the result in a variable
def average = getAverage(numbers)

// Display the result
println("The average of ${numbers} is ${average}")
