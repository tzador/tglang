/**
* A Groovy program that calculates the average of an array of integers
*/

// Define the array of integers
def numbers = [5, 10, 3, 15, 7, 9]

// Define a variable to store the sum
int sum = 0

// Loop through the array and add each number to the sum
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i]
}

// Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the array
double average = sum / numbers.length

// Print out the average
println("The average of the array is: " + average)

/* Output:
The average of the array is: 8.0
