// This code snippet uses closures to perform a complex mathematical operation

def numList = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
numList.each { num ->
    // create a closure to calculate the power of '3' for each number in the list
    def power = { exponent ->
        return num ** exponent
    }
    // invoke the closure with an exponent of '3'
    println("Number ${num} raised to the power of 3 is: ${power(3)}")
}
// output:
// Number 2 raised to the power of 3 is: 8
// Number 4 raised to the power of 3 is: 64
// Number 6 raised to the power of 3 is: 216
// Number 8 raised to the power of 3 is: 512
// Number 10 raised to the power of 3 is: 1000
