// This code snippet demonstrates the creation of a Person class and its properties

// Define the Person class with the required properties
class Person {
    String name // Property for storing the person's name
    int age // Property for storing the person's age
    String occupation // Property for storing the person's occupation
    String address // Property for storing the person's address

    // Constructor for creating a new Person object with the given parameters
    Person(String name, int age, String occupation, String address) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
        this.occupation = occupation
        this.address = address
    }

    // Method for printing the person's information
    void printInfo() {
        println("$name is $age years old and works as a $occupation. They live at $address.")
    }
}

// Create a new instance of the Person class with the given information
Person john = new Person("John Doe", 35, "Software Engineer", "123 Main St.")

// Call the printInfo method to print John's information
john.printInfo()
