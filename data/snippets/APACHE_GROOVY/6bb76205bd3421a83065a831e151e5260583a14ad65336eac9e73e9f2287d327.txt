//This code snippet creates a method to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle

//Define variables for length and width of rectangle
def length = 5
def width = 10

//Create method to calculate perimeter
def calculatePerimeter(length, width) {
    //Calculate perimeter by summing all sides together
    def perimeter = (2 * length) + (2 * width)

    //Print result
    println "The perimeter of the rectangle with length ${length} and width ${width} is ${perimeter}"
}

//Call method with given length and width variables
calculatePerimeter(length, width)
