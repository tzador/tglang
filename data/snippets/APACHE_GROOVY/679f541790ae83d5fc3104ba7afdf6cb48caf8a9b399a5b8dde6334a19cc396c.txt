//Create a method that calculates the factorial of a given number

//Define the method
def factorial(int n) {
    //Initialize a variable to store the result
    def result = 1
    
    //Loop through numbers from 1 to n and multiply them to the result variable
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= i
    }
    
    //Return the result
    return result
}

//Call the method and print the result
println("The factorial of 5 is: ${factorial(5)}")
//Output: The factorial of 5 is: 120
