// This is a complex code snippet in APACHE_GROOVY
// It initializes a list of numbers and filters out the even ones, then maps the remaining numbers to their cubes and finally calculates their average.

// Create list of numbers
def list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

// Filter out even numbers
def filteredList = list.findAll { it % 2 != 0 }

// Map numbers to their cubes
def mappedList = filteredList.collect { it * it * it }

// Calculate average
def sum = 0
mappedList.each { sum += it }
def average = sum / filteredList.size()

// Print result
println "The average of the cubes of the odd numbers in the list is: $average"
