//A simple Apache Groovy program that counts odd numbers within a range

//Define variables for start and end of range
def start = 1
def end = 10

//Create a method to check if a number is odd
def isOdd(number) {
  return (number % 2) != 0
}

//Create a variable to store the count of odd numbers
def count = 0

//Loop through the range and increment the count if the number is odd
for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
  if (isOdd(i)) {
    count++
  }
}

//Print the count of odd numbers
println "There are " + count + " odd numbers between " + start + " and " + end
