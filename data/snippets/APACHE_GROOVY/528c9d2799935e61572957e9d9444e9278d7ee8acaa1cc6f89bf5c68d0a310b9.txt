def num1 = 5
def num2 = 10
def num3 = 7

if (num1 < num2) {
    println("num1 is less than num2")
} else if (num1 > num2) {
    println("num1 is greater than num2")
} else {
    println("num1 is equal to num2")
}

// Output: num1 is less than num2
// Explanation: This code snippet compares the values of num1 and num2 using if-else statements and prints the corresponding statement depending on the result. In this case, num1 is less than num2, so the output is "num1 is less than num2".
