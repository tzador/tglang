// This code snippet uses Apache Groovy to calculate the average of a list of integers

// Define a list of integers to find the average of
def numbers = [4, 7, 10, 2, 3, 9, 5, 8, 6, 1]

// Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list
def total = numbers.inject(0){sum, i -> sum + i}

// Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of numbers in the list
def average = total / numbers.size()

// Print the average to the console
println "The average is: $average"
