// This code snippet uses a Groovy closure to iterate over a list, perform an operation on each element, and filter out elements that do not meet a certain condition.

def list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] // define a list of numbers

def filteredList = list.findAll { // use the Groovy "findAll" method to filter the list
    it % 2 == 0  // only keep elements that are even
}.collect { // use the "collect" method to transform the filtered list
    it * 2 // multiply each element by 2
}.sort() // sort the elements in ascending order

filteredList.each { // use the "each" method to iterate over the filtered and transformed list
    println(it) // print each element to the console
}
