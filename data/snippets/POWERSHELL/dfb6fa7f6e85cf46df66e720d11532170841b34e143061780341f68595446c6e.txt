# This code snippet calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart, including tax

# Initialize variables
$items = @(
    @{Name = "Shirt"; Price = 20},
    @{Name = "Pants"; Price = 30},
    @{Name = "Shoes"; Price = 50},
    @{Name = "Socks"; Price = 5}
)
$subtotal = 0
$taxRate = 0.08 # 8% tax rate
$taxAmount = 0
$total = 0

# Loop through items and calculate subtotal
foreach ($item in $items) {
    $subtotal += $item.Price
}

# Calculate tax amount
$taxAmount = $subtotal * $taxRate

# Calculate total
$total = $subtotal + $taxAmount

# Output results
Write-Host "Subtotal: $subtotal"
Write-Host "Tax amount: $taxAmount"
