# This code snippet creates an array of file names, iterates through each name and appends a prefix to the file name, then saves the renamed file.

[array]$fileNames = Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\Documents\Reports # Creates an array of file names from the specified directory

foreach($file in $fileNames){ # Iterates through each file name in the array
    $newName = "New_" + $file # Creates a new file name with a prefix
    $path = "C:\Users\Documents\Reports\" + $newName # Specifies the path for the renamed file
    Rename-Item $file.FullName -NewName $path # Renames the file using the new path and name
