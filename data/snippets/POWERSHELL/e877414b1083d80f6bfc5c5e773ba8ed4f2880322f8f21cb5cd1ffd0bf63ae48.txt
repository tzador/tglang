# Import the CSV file and save it as a PowerShell object
$dataset = Import-Csv -Path C:\Users\username\Documents\retail_data.csv

# Filter the dataset to only include purchases made by customers in a certain age range
$filteredData = $dataset | Where-Object { $_.Age -ge 25 -and $_.Age -le 40 }

# Group the data by customer gender and calculate the average purchase amount for each gender
$groupedData = $filteredData | Group-Object -Property Gender | Select-Object Name, @{Name="AvgPurchaseAmount";Expression={($_.Group | Measure-Object -Property PurchaseAmount -Average).Average}}

# Sort the grouped data in descending order based on the average purchase amount
$sortedData = $groupedData | Sort-Object -Property AvgPurchaseAmount -Descending

# Create a bar chart visualization using the sorted data
$sortedData | Out-Chart -Type Bar -Property Name, AvgPurchaseAmount -Title "Average Purchase Amount by Gender" -XName "Gender" -YName "Average Purchase Amount"

# Export the final results to a new CSV file
$sortedData | Export-Csv -Path C:\Users\username\Documents\purchase_insights.csv -NoTypeInformation
