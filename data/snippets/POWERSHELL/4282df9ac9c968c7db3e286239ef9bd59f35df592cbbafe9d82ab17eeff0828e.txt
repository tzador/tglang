#This code snippet uses a for loop to iterate through a list and print out all even numbers

#Define a list of numbers
$numbers = @(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

#Define a variable to store the final output
$output = @()

#Loop through the list of numbers
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $numbers.Length; $i++) {
    #Check if the number is even
    if($numbers[$i] % 2 -eq 0) {
        #Add the number to the output variable
        $output += $numbers[$i]
    }
}

#Print out the final output as a comma separated list
Write-Output "The even numbers are: $($output -join ', ')"
