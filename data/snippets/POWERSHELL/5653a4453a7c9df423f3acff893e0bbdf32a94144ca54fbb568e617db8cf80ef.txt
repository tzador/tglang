# This code snippet is a PowerShell script that takes user input, performs a series of mathematical calculations, and outputs the results.

# First, we prompt the user to enter a number
$num = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter a number:"

# Next, we convert the input into an integer
$num = [int]$num

# Then, we validate that the number is greater than zero
if ($num -le 0) {
    Write-Host "Error: Number must be greater than zero"
    exit
}

# Now we perform a series of calculations on the input number
$square = $num * $num
$cube = $num * $num * $num
$sqrt = [math]::Sqrt($num)
$log = [math]::Log($num)

# Finally, we output the results to the console
Write-Host "The square of $num is: $square"
Write-Host "The cube of $num is: $cube"
Write-Host "The square root of $num is: $sqrt"
Write-Host "The natural logarithm of $num is: $log"
