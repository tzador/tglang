# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number using recursion in PowerShell
function factorial ($n) {
    # Base case - if n is equal to 1, the factorial is also 1 
    if ($n -eq 1) {
        return 1
    }
    # Recursive case - calls the factorial function again with n-1 as the argument
    else {
        return $n * factorial($n - 1)
    }
}

# Prompt user to enter a number and save it in a variable
$num = Read-Host "Enter a number"

# Call the factorial function with the user-entered number as the argument
$result = factorial($num)

# Print the result
Write-Output "The factorial of $num is $result"
