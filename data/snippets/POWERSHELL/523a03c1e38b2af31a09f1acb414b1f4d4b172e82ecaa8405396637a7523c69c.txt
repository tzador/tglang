# This code snippet is a function that uses a loop to calculate the factorial of a given number.
# It takes in a parameter, num, and uses the accumulator pattern to keep track of the factorial value.
# The function then returns the factorial value at the end of the loop.

function Factorial($num){
    $factorial = 1
    for ($i = 1; $i -le $num; $i++){
        $factorial *= $i
    }
    return $factorial
}

# Example call to the function with a parameter of 5.
$result = Factorial(5)

# The result would be 120, as 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.
# Now, we can print the result to the console.
Write-Host "The factorial of 5 is: $result"

# Output: The factorial of 5 is: 120
