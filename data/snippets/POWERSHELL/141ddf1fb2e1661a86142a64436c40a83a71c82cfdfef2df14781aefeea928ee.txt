# This code snippet is a for loop that iterates through an array, checks for even numbers, and prints the sum of all even numbers in the array.

# Define an array with numbers
$numbers = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 

# Define a variable for total sum
$total_sum = 0 

# Begin for loop to iterate through array
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $numbers.Length; $i++) {

    # Check if number in array is even
    if ($numbers[$i] % 2 -eq 0) {

        # Add even number to total sum
        $total_sum = $total_sum + $numbers[$i] 
    }
}

# Print the total sum and include a message
"Total sum of even numbers in the array is $total_sum."
