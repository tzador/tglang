# This code snippet uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to remotely run a script block
# on a list of computers and output the results to a CSV file.

# Define the list of computers
$computers = "computer1","computer2","computer3"

# Define the script block to be run
$scriptBlock = {
    # Get and return the current date and time
    $date = Get-Date
    return "The current date and time is $date"
}

# Invoke the script block on each computer in the list
$results = Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computers -ScriptBlock $scriptBlock

# Output the results to a CSV file
$results | Export-Csv -Path "C:\output.csv"
