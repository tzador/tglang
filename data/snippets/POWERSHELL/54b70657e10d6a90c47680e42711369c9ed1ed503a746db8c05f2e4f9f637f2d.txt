# This code snippet will show the total size of a given directory in bytes

# First, we will set the directory that we want to check the size of
$directory = "C:\Users\Username\Documents"

# Next, we will use the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to retrieve all the files and folders within the directory
$items = Get-ChildItem -Path $directory -Recurse

# We will then use a foreach loop to iterate through each item in the directory
foreach ($item in $items) {

    # Check if the item is a file by using the Test-Path cmdlet, if it is a file, we will add its size to the total size variable
    if (Test-Path -Path $item.FullName -PathType Leaf) {
        $totalSize += $item.Size
    }
}

# Finally, we will print the total size of the directory in bytes
$totalSize
