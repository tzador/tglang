# this is a PowerShell code snippet that creates a new variable and uses a for loop to iterate through a list of items

$myVariable = "This is a variable" # creating a new variable and assigning a value to it

for ($i = 0; $i -lt 5; $i++) { # starting a for loop, with an initialization expression, condition expression, and iterator expression
    "Item $($i + 1): $($myVariable)" # using string interpolation to print the current item number and the value of the variable, incrementing the item number with each iteration
