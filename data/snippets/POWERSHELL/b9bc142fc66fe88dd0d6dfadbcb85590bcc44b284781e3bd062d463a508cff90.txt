# This code snippet uses PowerShell to check for the existence of a directory and create a new one if it does not exist.

# Set the current directory
$curDir = Get-Location

# Check if the directory already exists
if (!(Test-Path "C:\\myNewDir"))
{
	# Create the new directory
	New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\\myNewDir"

	# Change directory into the newly created directory
	Set-Location "C:\\myNewDir"

	# Write a message to show that the directory was created
	Write-Host "New directory 'myNewDir' was created in $curDir"
}
else
{
	# Directory already exists, write a message to indicate it
	Write-Host "Directory 'myNewDir' already exists in $curDir"
}
