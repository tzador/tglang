# This code snippet checks if a user exists in a specific Active Directory domain and then adds them to a group if they exist.

Import-Module ActiveDirectory # Import the Active Directory module for PowerShell

# Prompt for user input for the username and domain
$username = Read-Host "Enter the username"
$domain = Read-Host "Enter the domain"

# Check if the user exists in the specified domain
$user = Get-ADUser -Identity $username -Server $domain -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# If user exists, add them to the "Power Users" group
if ($user) {
    # Get the group "Power Users" from the specified domain
    $group = Get-ADGroup -Identity "Power Users" -Server $domain
    
    # Add the user to the group
    Add-ADGroupMember -Identity $group -Members $user
    
    # Output success message
    Write-Output "User $username was successfully added to the Power Users group in the $domain domain."
} else {
    # Output error message if user doesn't exist
    Write-Output "User $username does not exist in the $domain domain."
