# This is a code snippet for generating a Fibonacci sequence using Powershell
# Declare variables for the first two numbers in the sequence and the desired length
$first = 0
$second = 1
$length = 10

# Print the first two numbers in the sequence
Write-Host $first
Write-Host $second

# Loop through the remaining numbers and print them
for($i=2; $i -lt $length; $i++){
    # Calculate the next number in the sequence
    $next = $first + $second
    
    # Print the next number
    Write-Host $next 
    
    # Update the values of $first and $second
    $first = $second
    $second = $next

    # Comment to explain what is happening in the loop
    # In each iteration, the next number is calculated by adding the previous two numbers
    # The values of $first and $second are then updated to prepare for the next iteration
