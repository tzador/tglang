#This code snippet uses PowerShell to create a function that takes in two numbers and finds the sum of all numbers between them (inclusive).

function Get-SumBetweenNumbers{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [int]$num1,

        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [int]$num2
    )

    $sum = 0
    if ($num1 -gt $num2) {
        Write-Output "Error: First number must be smaller than or equal to second number."
    }
    else {
        for ($i = $num1; $i -le $num2; $i++) {
            $sum += $i
        }
        Write-Output "The sum of all numbers between $num1 and $num2 is $sum."
    }
}

#Testing the function with input numbers of 5 and 10.
Get-SumBetweenNumbers -num1 5 -num2 10

#Output: The sum of all numbers between 5 and 10 is 45.
