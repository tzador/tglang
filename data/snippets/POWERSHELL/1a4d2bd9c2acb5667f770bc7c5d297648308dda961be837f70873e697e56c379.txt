# This code snippet lists all files in a specific directory and renames them
# according to a predefined naming convention

# Define the directory path
$directory = "C:\Users\Documents\Files"

# An array of all the files in the directory
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $directory -File

# A loop that iterates through each file in the array
foreach($file in $files){

    # Split the file name into individual words by removing spaces
    $splitName = $file.Name -split " "

    # Join the words together with an underscore
    $newName = $splitName -join "_"

    # Replace any special characters in the file name with an empty string
    $newName = $newName -replace '[^\w\d]', ''

    # Create the new file path by combining the directory path and the new file name
    $newPath = "$directory\$newName"

    # Rename the file with the new file path
    Rename-Item -Path $file.FullName -NewName $newPath
