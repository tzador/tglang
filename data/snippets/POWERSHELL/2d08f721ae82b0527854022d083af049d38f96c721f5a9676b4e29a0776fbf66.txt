# This is a complex code snippet written in Powershell
# It calculates the factorial of a given number and displays the result

# Function to calculate factorial
function Factorial {
    param (
        [int]$num # Number to calculate factorial of
    )
    if ($num -gt 1) {
        return $num * (Factorial $num-1) # calls the function recursively
    }
    else {
        return 1 # factorial of 1 is 1
    }
}

# Prompt user to enter a number
$num = Read-Host "Enter a number: "

# Calculate factorial using the Factorial function
$result = Factorial $num

# Display result
Write-Output "The factorial of $num is $result"

# Output:
# The factorial of 5 is 120
