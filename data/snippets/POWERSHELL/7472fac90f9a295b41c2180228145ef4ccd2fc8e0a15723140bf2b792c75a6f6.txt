# This code snippet is a PowerShell script that retrieves information about operating system and hardware.
# It uses the Get-WmiObject cmdlet to retrieve data from the Win32_OperatingSystem and Win32_Processor classes.

# Define a variable to store the Win32_OperatingSystem class object
$operatingSystem = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem

# Define a variable to store the Win32_Processor class object
$processor = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Processor

# Output the information to the console using Write-Host
Write-Host "Operating System Information:`n"
Write-Host "Name: $($operatingSystem.Name)"
Write-Host "Version: $($operatingSystem.Version)"
Write-Host "Manufacturer: $($operatingSystem.Manufacturer)"
Write-Host "Serial Number: $($operatingSystem.SerialNumber)"
Write-Host "Architecture: $($operatingSystem.OSArchitecture)"

Write-Host "`nProcessor Information:`n"
Write-Host "Name: $($processor.Name)"
Write-Host "Description: $($processor.Description)"
