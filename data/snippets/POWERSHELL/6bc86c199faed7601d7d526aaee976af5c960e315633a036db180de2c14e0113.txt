# This script uses regular expressions to extract all email addresses from a given file

# First, we need to define the input file
$inputFile = "input.txt"

# Read the contents of the file
$input = Get-Content -Path $inputFile

# Define the regular expression pattern for email addresses
$pattern = '[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'
# This pattern will look for strings that follow the format of an email address - username@domain

# Create an empty array to store the extracted email addresses
$emails = @()

# Loop through each line in the file
foreach ($line in $input) {
    # Use the -match operator to check if the line contains an email address
    if($line -match $pattern){
        # If it does, add the matched email address to the array
        $emails += $Matches[0]
    }
}

# Convert the array to a string with each email address separated by a comma
$emailsString = $emails -join ","

# Output the final list of extracted email addresses
Write-Host "Extracted email addresses: $emailsString"
