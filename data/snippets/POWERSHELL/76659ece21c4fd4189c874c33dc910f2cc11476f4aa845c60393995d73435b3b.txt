# Description: This is a complex code snippet in PowerShell
# It creates a new array, iterates through it,
# and uses conditional statements and loops to manipulate and print the data

# Create a new array with 10 random numbers
$array = (1..10) | Get-Random

# Create a new empty array to store results
$resultArray = @()

# Loop through each number in the array and check if it's even or odd
foreach ($number in $array) {
    # If the number is even, square it and add it to the result array
    if ($number % 2 -eq 0) {
        $result = $number * $number
        $resultArray += $result
    }
    # If the number is odd, cube it and add it to the result array
    else {
        $result = $number * $number * $number
        $resultArray += $result
    }
}

# Print out the original array
Write-Host "Original Array:"
$array

# Print out the result array with annotations
Write-Host "Result Array:"
$resultArray # This array should only contain squared or cubed numbers based on their odd/even status
