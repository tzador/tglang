# Create a function to calculate the average of a given list of numbers
# The function takes in a list of numbers as a parameter and returns the average

function Get-Average {
    param(
        [parameter(Mandatory)]
        [double[]]$numbers
    )

    # Initialize the sum variable
    $sum = 0

    # Loop through the numbers and add them to the sum
    foreach($number in $numbers) {
        $sum += $number 
    }

    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count of numbers
    $average = $sum / $numbers.Count

    # Return the average
    return $average
}

# Example usage:

# Create a list of numbers
$numbers = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

# Call the Get-Average function on the list of numbers
Get-Average -numbers $numbers

# Expected output: 5.5
