# This code snippet demonstrates how to search a text file for a specific string and return the line number
# and line content where the string is found, using Powershell

# Input parameters
$file_path = "C:\Users\my_user\Documents\my_file.txt" # Path to text file to search
$search_string = "apple" # String to search for in the text file

# Read in the text file as an array of strings
$text_file = Get-Content -Path $file_path 

# Loop through each line in the text file, keeping track of the line number
foreach ($line in $text_file) {
    $line_number = [array]::IndexOf($text_file, $line) + 1 # Add 1 to line number because arrays start at 0 index

    # Check if line contains the search string
    if ($line -like "*$search_string*") {
        # Output the line number and line content in a formatted string
        Write-Host "Found `$search_string on line $line_number:`n$line`n"
    }
}
# Output:
# 
# Found "apple" on line 2:
# This is an apple
# 
# Found "apple" on line 6:
# An apple a day keeps the doctor away
