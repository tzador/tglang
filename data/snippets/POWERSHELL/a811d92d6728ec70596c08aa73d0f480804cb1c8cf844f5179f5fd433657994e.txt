# This is a PowerShell script that checks if a given year is a leap year

# Declare a variable to store the input year
$year = Read-Host "Enter a year"

# Declare a variable to store the result
$result = ""

# Check if the year is divisible by 4
if($year % 4 -eq 0){

    # Check if the year is divisible by 100
    if($year % 100 -eq 0){

        # Check if the year is divisible by 400
        if($year % 400 -eq 0){
            # If yes, assign "Leap year" to result variable
            $result = "Leap year"
        }
        else {

            $result = "Not a leap year"
        }

    else {
        # If year is not divisible by 100 but divisible by 4, assign "Leap year" to result variable
        $result = "Leap year"

}
else {
    # If year is not divisible by 4, assign "Not a leap year" to result variable
