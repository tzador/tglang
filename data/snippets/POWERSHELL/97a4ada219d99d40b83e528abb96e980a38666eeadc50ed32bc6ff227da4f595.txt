#This is a PowerShell script that checks the CPU usage of a remote computer and sends an email notification if it exceeds the set threshold

#Comment: This script can be scheduled to run periodically and help in monitoring the CPU usage of remote computers. It can be modified to include other parameters such as memory usage and disk space as well.
