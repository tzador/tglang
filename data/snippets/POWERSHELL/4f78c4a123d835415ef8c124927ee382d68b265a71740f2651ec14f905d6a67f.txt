# This code snippet reads a list of users and their corresponding email addresses from a CSV file, then creates a new user in Active Directory and sets the user's email address.

# Import Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Define CSV file path
$csvFilePath = "C:\users.csv"

# Read CSV file using Import-Csv cmdlet
$userList = Import-Csv $csvFilePath

# Loop through each user in the CSV file
foreach ($user in $userList) {

    # Create user with New-ADUser cmdlet
    New-ADUser -Name $user.Name -SamAccountName $user.Name -EmailAddress $user.Email -Enabled $true

    # Set user's password with Set-ADAccountPassword cmdlet
    Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity $user.Name -Reset -NewPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "P@ssw0rd" -Force)

    # Set user's description with Set-ADUser cmdlet
    Set-ADUser -Identity $user.Name -Description "$($user.Name) is a new user in the system."

    # Add user to a group with Add-ADGroupMember cmdlet
    Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Members $user.Name
