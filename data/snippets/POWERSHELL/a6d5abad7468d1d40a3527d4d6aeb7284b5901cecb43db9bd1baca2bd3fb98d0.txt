# Function to calculate factorial of a number
function Factorial($num)
{
  # Initializing the result variable to 1
  $result = 1

  # Looping through the numbers from 1 to the given number
  for($i = 1; $i -le $num; $i++)
  {
    # Multiplying the result variable with the current number
    $result = $result * $i
  }

  # Returning the calculated factorial
  return $result
}

# Calling the Factorial function and storing the result in a variable
$factorial = Factorial 5

# Printing the result to the console
Write-Host "Factorial of 5 is: $factorial"
