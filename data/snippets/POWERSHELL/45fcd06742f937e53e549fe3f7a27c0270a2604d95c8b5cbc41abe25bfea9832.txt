# This is a Powershell code snippet that creates a new variable, assigns a value to it, and uses a loop to print out the value of the variable multiple times.

# Define a new variable and assign a value of 5 to it
$variable = 5

# Use a for loop to print out the value of the variable 10 times
for ($i = 0; $i -lt 10; $i++){
    # Print out the value of the variable using the Write-Host command
    Write-Host "The value of the variable is: $variable"
}

# Output:
# The value of the variable is: 5
# The value of the variable is: 5
# The value of the variable is: 5
# The value of the variable is: 5
# The value of the variable is: 5
# The value of the variable is: 5
# The value of the variable is: 5
# The value of the variable is: 5
# The value of the variable is: 5
# The value of the variable is: 5
