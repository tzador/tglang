.SYNOPSIS
    This is a script to automate the creation of user accounts in Active Directory.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script takes user information as input and creates a new user account in Active Directory.
    It also sets various properties such as password, group membership, and organizational unit (OU).
    The script uses a CSV file as input, with the following columns: First Name, Last Name, Username, Password, Groups, and OU.
    The script can also be run in an interactive mode, where the user is prompted for each input.

.PARAMETER InputFile
    Specifies the path to the CSV file containing user information. If not provided, the script will run in interactive mode.

.EXAMPLE
    Create-Users -InputFile "C:\Users.csv"

.INPUTS
