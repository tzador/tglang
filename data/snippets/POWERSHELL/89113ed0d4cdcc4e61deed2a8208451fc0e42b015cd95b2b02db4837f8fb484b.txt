# This code snippet uses PowerShell to retrieve information about processes running on a remote computer

# Import the PSSession module
Import-Module PSSession

# Create a new PSSession to the remote computer
$Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName <remote computer name>

# Use the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a command on the remote computer
Invoke-Command -Session $Session -ScriptBlock {

    # Get the process information using the Get-Process cmdlet
    $processList = Get-Process

    # Loop through the process list
    foreach ($process in $processList) {

        # Print out the process name and its ID
        Write-Host "Process Name:" $process.Name
        Write-Host "Process ID:" $process.Id
    }
