#This code snippet performs a simple calculation of the hypotenuse of a right triangle
function Get-Hypotenuse {
    #Declare the two known sides of the triangle
    param($a,$b)
    #Calculate the square of each side
    $aSquared = $a * $a
    $bSquared = $b * $b
    #Add the squared values together
    $sum = $aSquared + $bSquared
    #Take the square root of the sum
    $hypotenuse = [math]::Sqrt($sum)
    #Return the hypotenuse value
    Return $hypotenuse
}

#Call the function and pass in the values of the two known sides
Get-Hypotenuse 3 4

#Output:
#5
