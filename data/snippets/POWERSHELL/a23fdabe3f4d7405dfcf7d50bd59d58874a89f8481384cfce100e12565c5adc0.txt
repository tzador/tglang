# This code snippet uses PowerShell to create a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

function Factorial($number) {
    if ($number -eq 0) { # Checks if number is 0
        return 1 # If number is 0, return 1
    }
    else { # If number is not 0
        $factorial = 1 # Initialize a variable to store the factorial value
        for ($i = $number; $i -gt 0; $i--) { # Loop to multiply all numbers from given number down to 1
            $factorial = $factorial * $i # Multiply the current factorial value with the current number
        }
        return $factorial # Return the final factorial value
    }
}

# Example usage:
# Calculate the factorial of 5
$result = Factorial(5)
Write-Host "The factorial of 5 is $result"

# Output:
# The factorial of 5 is 120
