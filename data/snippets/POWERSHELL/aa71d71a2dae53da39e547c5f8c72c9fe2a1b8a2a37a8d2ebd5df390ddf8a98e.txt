# This code snippet is a PowerShell program that calculates the factorial of a given integer.

# Define a function to calculate factorial
function Factorial($number) {

    # Check if the number is negative
    if ($number -lt 0) {
        throw "Factorial cannot be calculated for negative numbers."
    }

    # Check if the number is zero or one which have fixed factorial values
    if ($number -eq 0 -or $number -eq 1) {
        return 1
    }

    # Initialize the factorial variable to 1
    $factorial = 1

    # Loop through all numbers from 2 to the given number
    for ($i = 2; $i -le $number; $i++) {

        # Multiply the factorial variable with the current number
        $factorial = $factorial * $i
    }

    # Return the calculated factorial
    return $factorial
}

# Take user input for the number
$number = Read-Host "Enter an integer to calculate its factorial:"

# Call the Factorial function and print the result
"Factorial of $number is $(Factorial $number)"

# Output:
`Factorial of <user_input> is <calculated_factorial>`
