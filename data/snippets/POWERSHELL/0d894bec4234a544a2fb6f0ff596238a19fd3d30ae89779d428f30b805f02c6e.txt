# This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number. 
# It uses a recursive approach.

function factorial {
    param([int]$num)
    
    # Base case: if the number is 0 or 1, its factorial is 1
    if ($num -le 1) {
        return 1
    }

    # Recursive case: call the function again with the number minus 1
    $result = $num * factorial($num - 1)

    # Output the result
    return $result
}

# Get user input for the number
$number = Read-Host "Enter a number"

# Call the factorial function and assign the result to a variable
$result = factorial $number

# Output the result
Write-Host "The factorial of" $number "is" $result
