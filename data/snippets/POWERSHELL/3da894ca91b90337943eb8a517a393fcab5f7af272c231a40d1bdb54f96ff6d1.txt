# This code snippet is a Powershell script that creates a new user and assigns them to a specific group in Active Directory
# First, import the Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
# Create a password for the new user
$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString "SecureP@ssw0rd" -AsPlainText -Force
# Set up the user's first and last name
$FirstName = "John"
$LastName = "Doe"
# Generate the username by combining the first letter of the first name and the last name
$Username = $FirstName[0] + $LastName
# Create the new user with the given information
New-ADUser -Name "$FirstName $LastName" -AccountPassword $Password -Enabled $true -SamAccountName $Username -UserPrincipalName "$Username@domain.com"
