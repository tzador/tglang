### This code snippet uses Powershell to retrieve active directory user information

# Import the Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Get user information from Active Directory and store in a variable
$user = Get-ADUser -Identity "JohnDoe"

# Convert the user's last logon time from UTC to local time
$lastLogon = [datetime]::FromFileTime($user.LastLogonTimestamp)

# Display the user's name, account status, and last logon time
Write-Host "Name: $user.Name"
Write-Host "Account Status: $user.Enabled"
Write-Host "Last Logon Time: $lastLogon"

# Retrieve the user's group membership
Write-Host "Group Membership:"
$groups = Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity $user

# Loop through each group and display the name and description
foreach ($group in $groups) {
    Write-Host "Name: $group.Name"
    Write-Host "Description: $group.Description"
}

# Display the user's email address
Write-Host "Email Address: $user.EmailAddress"

# Use Try-Catch block to handle any errors that may occur
try {
    # Update the user's title to "Manager"
    Set-ADUser -Identity $user -Title "Manager"
    Write-Host "Title has been updated for $user."
}
catch {
    # If an error occurs, display the error message
    Write-Host "An error occurred: $_.Exception.Message"
}
