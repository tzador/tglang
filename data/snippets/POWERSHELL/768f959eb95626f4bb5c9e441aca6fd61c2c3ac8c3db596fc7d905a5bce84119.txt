# This script will query the Active Directory for all users and retrieve their full name and email address

# First, we import the Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Next, we get all users from the Active Directory and store it in a variable
$users = Get-ADUser -Filter *

# After, we loop through each user in the $users variable
foreach ($user in $users) {

    # We first retrieve the full name and store it in a variable
    $fullName = $user.FullName

    # Next, we retrieve the email address and store it in a variable
    $email = $user.EmailAddress

    # Then, we print the full name and email address of the user using the Write-Output cmdlet
    Write-Output "User's full name: $fullName"
    Write-Output "User's email address: $email"

    # Finally, we add a blank line to separate each user's information
    Write-Output ""
}

# Output:
# User's full name: John Smith
# User's email address: john.smith@example.com
#
# User's full name: Jane Doe
# User's email address: jane.doe@example.com
#
# ...
