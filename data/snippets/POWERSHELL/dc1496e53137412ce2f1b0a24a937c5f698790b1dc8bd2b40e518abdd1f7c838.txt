#This code snippet will generate a random password of 10 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.

$chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*(){}[]?/<>|"

#Initialize an empty string to store the generated password
$password = ""

#Loop through 10 times to generate 10 characters for the password
for ($i = 0; $i -lt 10; $i++) {

    #Generate a random number between 0 and the length of the $chars string
    $charIndex = Get-Random -Minimum 0 -Maximum $chars.Length

    #Use the random number as an index to retrieve a character from the $chars string
    $password += $chars[$charIndex]

#Print the generated password
