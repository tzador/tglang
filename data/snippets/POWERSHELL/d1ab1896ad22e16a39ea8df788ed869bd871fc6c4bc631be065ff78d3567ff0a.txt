#This script will recursively search for .txt files in the user's home directory and list their contents
#Note: This is a Windows-specific PowerShell script
#Comment blocks in PowerShell start with the '#' symbol

#First, we need to set the location to the user's home directory
Set-Location $home

#Next, we will use the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to recursively search for .txt files in the current directory
#The -Recurse parameter tells PowerShell to search all subdirectories as well
#The -Include parameter specifies that we are only interested in .txt files
#The -Force parameter makes sure hidden files are included in the search
$txtFiles = Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.txt -Force

#Next, we will loop through each .txt file and display its contents
foreach ($file in $txtFiles) {
    #We will use the Get-Content cmdlet to read the contents of the file
    $contents = Get-Content $file

    #Now we will print the file name and its contents
    Write-Host "File Name: $($file.Name)"
    Write-Host "Contents:"

    #We will use the foreach loop again to print each line of the file
    foreach ($line in $contents) {
        Write-Host $line
    }

    #We will add a separation line after each file for readability
    Write-Host "----------------------"
}

#Finally, we will print a message to indicate when the script has finished
Write-Host "Finished listing contents of .txt files in $home"
