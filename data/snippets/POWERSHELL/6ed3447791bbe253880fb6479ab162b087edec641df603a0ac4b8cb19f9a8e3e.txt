# This code snippet is used to loop through and check a list of numbers

# Declaring a variable to store the list of numbers
$numbers = @(12, 45, 90, 33, 20, 5, 66)

# Defining a function to check if the number is even or odd
Function Check-EvenOdd ($number) {
    if ($number % 2 -eq 0) {
        Write-Host "$number is even"
    }
    else {
        Write-Host "$number is odd"
    }
}

# Looping through the list of numbers and calling the Check-EvenOdd function on each number
foreach ($num in $numbers) {
    Check-EvenOdd $num
}
