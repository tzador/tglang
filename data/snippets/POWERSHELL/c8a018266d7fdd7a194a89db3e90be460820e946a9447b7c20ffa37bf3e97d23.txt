# Function to calculate the factorial of a number
Function Calculate-Factorial {
    param(
        [Int]$n # Input number
    )
    If ($n -eq 0) { # Base case
        Write-Output 1 # Return 1 for factorial of 0
    }
    If ($n -eq 1) { # Base case
        Write-Output 1 # Return 1 for factorial of 1
    }
    else { # Recursive case
        Write-Output $n * (Calculate-Factorial ($n-1)) # Recursive call to calculate factorial of n-1
    }
}
# Calculate factorial of input number
$factorial = Calculate-Factorial 5
# Output factorial
Write-Output "Factorial of 5 is $factorial"
