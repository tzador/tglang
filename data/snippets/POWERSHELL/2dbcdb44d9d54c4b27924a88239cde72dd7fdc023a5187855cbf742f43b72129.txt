### This code snippet will prompt the user to enter a number,
### then check if the number is prime or not.
### If the number is prime, it will print "The number is prime."
### If the number is not prime, it will print "The number is not prime."

# Prompt user to enter number
$number = Read-Host "Enter a number:"

# Convert input to integer
$number = [int]$number

# Initialize counter variable
$count = 0

# Check for prime number
for ($i = 1; $i -le $number; $i++) {
    if ($number % $i -eq 0) {
        $count++
    }
}

# Print output based on prime or not
if ($count -gt 2) {
    Write-Output "The number is not prime."
} else {
    Write-Output "The number is prime."
