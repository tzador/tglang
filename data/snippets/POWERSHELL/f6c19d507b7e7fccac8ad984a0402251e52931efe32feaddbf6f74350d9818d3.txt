# This code snippet reads a CSV file and returns the average of a specific column.
# The file path and column name can be changed as desired.

# Import the CSV module
Import-Module CSV

# Set the file path
$path = "C:\Users\john\Desktop\data.csv"

# Read the CSV file
$data = Import-CSV $path

# Define the column to find average
$columnName = "Revenue"

# Calculate the total sum of the column
$sum = 0
foreach ($row in $data)
{
    $sum += [double]$row.$columnName
}

# Calculate the total number of rows in the CSV file
$totalRows = $data.count

# Calculate the average
$average = $sum / $totalRows

# Output the average
Write-Host "The average $columnName is: $average"
