# This is a complex PowerShell script that checks for the presence of a specific service and performs various actions based on its status

# Define variables
$serviceName = "ExampleService"
$status = Get-Service $serviceName | Select-Object -Expand Status

# Check if service is running
if ($status -eq "Running") {
    Write-Host "Status of $serviceName is currently running."
}
# Check if service is stopped
elseif ($status -eq "Stopped") {
    Write-Host "Status of $serviceName is currently stopped."
    # Try to start service
    try {
        Start-Service -Name $serviceName
        Write-Host "Successfully started $serviceName."
    }
    # Catch any errors
    catch {
        Write-Host "Failed to start $serviceName due to error: $_"
    }
}
# Service is in a different state
else {
    Write-Host "Status of $serviceName is currently $status."
    # Try to restart service
    try {
