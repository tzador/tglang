# This is a complex code snippet in PowerShell that calculates the factorial of a given number.

# First, we define the function for calculating factorial
function Factorial {
    param($num)

    # Initialize the result variable
    $fact = 1

    # Loop through each number from 1 to the given number and multiply it with the current result
    for($i = 1; $i -le $num; $i++){
        $fact *= $i
    }

    # Return the calculated factorial
    return $fact
}

# Prompt the user to enter a number
Write-Host "Enter a number: "

# Read the input from the user and convert it to an integer
$num = [int]::Parse(Read-Host)

# Call the Factorial function and pass in the user input
$result = Factorial $num

# Print the result
Write-Host "The factorial of $num is $result"
