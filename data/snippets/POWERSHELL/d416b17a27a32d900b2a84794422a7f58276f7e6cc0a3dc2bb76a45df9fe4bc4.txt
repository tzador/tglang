<# This code snippet takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of squares #>
$numList = @(1,2,3,4,5)

$sum = 0 # initialize sum variable

foreach($num in $numList){ # loop through each number in list
  $square = $num * $num # square the number
  $sum += $square # add square to sum variable
}

Write-Output "The sum of squares is: $sum" # print sum of squares to output
