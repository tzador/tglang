# This code snippet demonstrates creating a new file and writing data to it.
# It uses the Get-Date cmdlet to generate a unique file name based on the current date and time.

# Define a variable for the file name
$fileName = "output_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss').txt"

# Use the New-Item cmdlet to create the file
New-Item -ItemType File -Path $fileName | Out-Null

# Use the Out-File cmdlet to write data to the file
"Hello world!" | Out-File -FilePath $fileName -Encoding UTF8 -Append

# Get the content of the file using the Get-Content cmdlet
Get-Content -Path $fileName

# Output:
# Hello world!
