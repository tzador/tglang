# This code snippet takes in user input for two numbers, adds them together, and displays the result

# Prompt user for first number
$firstNum = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter first number:" 

# Prompt user for second number
$secondNum = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter second number:"

# Convert input to integers
$firstNum = [int]$firstNum
$secondNum = [int]$secondNum

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers
$result = $firstNum + $secondNum

# Display the result to the user
Write-Host "The sum of $firstNum and $secondNum is $result"
