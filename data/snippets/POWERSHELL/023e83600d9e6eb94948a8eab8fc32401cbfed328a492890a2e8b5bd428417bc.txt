#This is a powershell script that creates a new user in Active Directory and sets properties for the user account.

# First, we will define variables for the user's first name, last name, and username.

$firstName = "John"
$lastName = "Doe"
$username = "jdoe"

# Next, we will generate a password for the user.

$password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "P@ssw0rd" -AsPlainText -Force 

# Then, we will create a new user object with the defined variables and add it to Active Directory.

New-ADUser -Name "$firstName $lastName" -SamAccountName $username -AccountPassword $password -Enabled $true -Path "OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com" 

# Finally, we will set additional properties for the user account, such as email address and group membership.

Set-ADUser $username -EmailAddress "$username@example.com" -Add @{MemberOf="CN=Employees,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com"}

# Output: New user account created in Active Directory with defined first name, last name, username, password, email address, and group membership.
