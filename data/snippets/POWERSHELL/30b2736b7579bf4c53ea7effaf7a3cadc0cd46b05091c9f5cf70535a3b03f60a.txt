# This code snippet is a powershell script that utilizes the [System.IO.Directory] class
# to search for certain file types in a given directory and its subdirectories.

# First, we declare a variable to store the directory path we want to search.
$directory = "C:\Users\Documents"

# We then use the [System.IO.Directory] class to get a list of all the files in the directory.
$files = [System.IO.Directory]::GetFiles($directory)

# Now, we will loop through each file in the directory.
foreach ($file in $files) {

    # Using the [System.IO.Path] class, we can access the file name and extension.
    $fileName = [System.IO.Path]::GetFileName($file)

    # We then check if the file extension matches the ones we want to search for.
    if ($fileName -match "\.(pdf|docx|ppt)$") {

        # If it does, we print out the file path and name.
        Write-Host "File found: $file"

        # We can also perform other actions, such as moving or copying the file.
        Move-Item $file "C:\Users\Documents\FoundFiles"
    }
}

# Lastly, we can also search for files in subdirectories by using a different method from the [System.IO.Directory] class.
$filesInSubdirectories = [System.IO.Directory]::GetFiles($directory, "*.*", [System.IO.SearchOption]::AllDirectories)

# We then loop through each file, check for file type, and perform actions if needed.
foreach ($file in $filesInSubdirectories) {
    $fileName = [System.IO.Path]::GetFileName($file)
    if ($fileName -match "\.(jpg|png)$") {
        Write-Host "File found: $file"
        Copy-Item $file "C:\Users\Documents\FoundImages"
    }
