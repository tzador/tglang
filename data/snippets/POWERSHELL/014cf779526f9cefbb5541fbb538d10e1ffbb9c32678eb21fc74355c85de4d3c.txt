# This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive approach

# Define the function
function Calculate-Factorial {
    param(
        [int]$num # Input parameter for number to calculate factorial
    )
    if($num -le 1) { # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
        return 1
    }
    else { # Recursive case: multiply number with factorial of previous number
        return $num * (Calculate-Factorial ($num - 1))
    }
}

# Call the function and pass in a number
$result = Calculate-Factorial 5 # Will calculate factorial of 5
Write-Host "Factorial of 5 is: $result" # Output the result

# Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120
