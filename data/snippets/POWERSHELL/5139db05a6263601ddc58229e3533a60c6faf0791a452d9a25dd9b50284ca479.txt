# This is a powershell code snippet that iterates through a list of numbers and prints out the even numbers.

# Create a list of numbers
$numbers = @(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

# Define an array to hold the even numbers
$evenNumbers = @()

# Loop through each number in the list
foreach ($number in $numbers) {

    # Check if the number is even using modulus operator
    if ($number % 2 -eq 0) {

        # If even, add it to the evenNumbers array
        $evenNumbers += $number
    }
}

# Print out the even numbers
$evenNumbers
