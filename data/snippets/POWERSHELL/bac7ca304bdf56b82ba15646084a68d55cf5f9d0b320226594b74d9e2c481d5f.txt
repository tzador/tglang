# This code snippet uses the PowerShell programming language and creates a new hashtable variable to store data
$myHashtable = @{}

# Populating the hashtable with key-value pairs
$myHashtable["Name"] = "John"
$myHashtable["Age"] = 30
$myHashtable["Occupation"] = "Software Engineer"
$myHashtable["Salary"] = "$100,000"

# Creating an array of strings
$myArray = @("One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five")

# Using a for loop to iterate through the array and add each value to the hashtable with a calculated key
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $myArray.Length; $i++) {
    $myHashtable["Item $($i+1)"] = $myArray[$i]
}

# Using the Write-Host command to display the contents of the hashtable
Write-Host "MyHashtable contains the following data:"
$myHashtable

# Output:
#
# MyHashtable contains the following data:
# 
# Name            : John
# Age             : 30
# Occupation      : Software Engineer
# Salary          : $100,000
# Item 1          : One
# Item 2          : Two
# Item 3          : Three
# Item 4          : Four
# Item 5          : Five
