# This code snippet uses the PowerShell scripting language

# First, we declare a variable with a string value
$actor = "Tom Hanks"

# Next, we define a function that will greet the actor
Function Greet-Actor {
    # We use the param command to declare the input parameters for the function
    param (
        [string]$name
    )
    # We use the Write-Host command to print out a personalized greeting
    Write-Host "Hello, $name! It's great to meet you!"
}
# Now, we call the function and pass in the $actor variable as the input parameter
Greet-Actor -name $actor

# The output will be:
# Hello, Tom Hanks! It's great to meet you!
