# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number

# This function takes in a number as a parameter
function Factorial {
    param (
        [int]$num
    )
    $factorial = 1
    # Loop from 1 to the given number
    for ($i = 1; $i -le $num; $i++) {
        $factorial = $factorial * $i
    }
    # Print the factorial of the given number
    Write-Host "The factorial of $num is $factorial"
}

# Calling the function with the input 5
Factorial 5

# Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
