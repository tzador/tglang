# This code snippet creates a function that takes in a list of numbers, finds the even numbers, and multiplies them by 2

# Define function for finding even numbers and multiplying them by 2
function Find-EvenAndMultiply {
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)] # Specifies that a parameter is required
    $numbers # List of numbers
)
    
    # Initialize empty array to store even numbers
    $evenNumbers = @()
    
    # Loop through numbers parameter
    foreach ($num in $numbers) {
        if ($num % 2 -eq 0) { # Checks if number is even
            $evenNumbers += $num * 2 # Multiplies even number by 2 and adds it to evenNumbers array
        }
    }
    
    # Outputs even numbers multiplied by 2
    Write-Output $evenNumbers 
}

# Example usage:
# Call function and pass in a list of numbers 1 to 10
