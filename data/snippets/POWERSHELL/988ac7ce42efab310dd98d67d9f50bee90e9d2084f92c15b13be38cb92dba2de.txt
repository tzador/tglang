# This script automates the process of copying files from one folder to another and renaming them

# Define source and destination paths
$source = "C:\Users\Documents\Photos"
$destination = "C:\Users\Documents\Backup"

# Get all the files in the source folder
$files = Get-ChildItem $source

# Loop through each file
foreach ($file in $files) {
    # Create new file name by appending _backup to original file name
    $newFileName = $file.BaseName + "_backup" + $file.Extension

    # Copy the file to the new destination
    Copy-Item -Path $file.FullName -Destination $destination

    # Rename the file using the new file name
    Rename-Item -Path ($destination + "\" + $file.Name) -NewName $newFileName
