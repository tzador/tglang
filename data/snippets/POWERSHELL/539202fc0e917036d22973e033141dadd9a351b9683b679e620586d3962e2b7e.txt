# This code snippet creates a function to calculate the factorial of a number

function factorial {
    param ([int]$num)
    if ($num -eq 0 -or $num -eq 1) { # Base case: 0! and 1! is 1
        return 1
    }
    else {
        $factorial = 1
        for ($i = 1; $i -le $num; $i++) { 
            $factorial *= $i # Multiply by each number from 1 to num
        }
        return $factorial
    }
}

# Example usage:
$num = 5 # Factorial of 5: 5! = 120
Write-Host "Factorial of $num is $(factorial $num)" # Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
