# This code snippet uses ForEach-Object cmdlet to iterate through an array of strings
# and converts each string to lowercase using the ToLower() method.

$strings = @("HELLO", "WORLD", "HOW", "ARE", "YOU")

# The ForEach-Object cmdlet is used to iterate through each item in the $strings array.
# The $_ automatic variable is used to access the current item in the pipeline.

$strings | ForEach-Object {
    # The ToLower() method is called on the current item to convert it to lowercase.
    $_.ToLower()
