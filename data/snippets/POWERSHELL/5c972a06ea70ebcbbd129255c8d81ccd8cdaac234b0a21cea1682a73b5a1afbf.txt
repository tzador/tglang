# This code snippet uses PowerShell to create a function that computes
# the factorial of a given number and then output the result to the console.

# Define the function
function Factorial ($num) {

    # Check if input is a number
    if ($num -isnot [int]) {
        Write-Error "Input must be an integer."
        return
    }

    # Check if input is a positive number
    if ($num -lt 0) {
        Write-Error "Input must be positive."
        return
    }

    # Initialize a variable to hold the factorial value
    $factorial = 1

    # Iterate through numbers starting from 1 up to the given number
    for ($i = 1; $i -le $num; $i++) {

        # Multiply the current factorial value by the current number
        $factorial *= $i
    }

    # Output the result to the console
    Write-Output "The factorial of $num is $factorial."
}

# Call the function with a given number
Factorial 6

# Output:
# The factorial of 6 is 720.
