# This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

function Calculate-Factorial {
    param(
        [parameter(Mandatory)]
        [int]$number
    )

    # initialize a variable to store the result
    $factorial = 1
    
    # use a for loop to iterate from 1 to the given number
    for ($i = 1; $i -le $number; $i++) {
        # multiply the current value of $factorial by the current value of $i
        $factorial = $factorial * $i
    }

    # return the factorial as the output
    return $factorial
}

# example usage: calculate the factorial of 5
Calculate-Factorial -number 5
