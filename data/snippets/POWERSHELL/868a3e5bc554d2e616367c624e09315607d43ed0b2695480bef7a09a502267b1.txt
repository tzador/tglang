# This code snippet uses PowerShell to get system information and export it to a CSV file

# First, we need to import the necessary modules
Import-Module -Name ComputerManagementDsc

# Next, we need to get the system information and store it in a variable
$systemInfo = Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_OperatingSystem

# Create a new CSV file to store the system information
New-Item -Path "C:\SystemInfo.csv" -ItemType File

# Open the CSV file for writing
$csvFile = Open-File -Path "C:\SystemInfo.csv" -Mode Write

# Write the system information to the CSV file
Write-Csv -InputObject $systemInfo -Path $csvFile

# Close the CSV file
$csvFile.Close()
