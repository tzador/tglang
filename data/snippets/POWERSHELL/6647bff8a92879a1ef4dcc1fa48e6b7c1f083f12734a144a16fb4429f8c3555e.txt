#Create a new variable named "numbers" that contains an array of numbers
$numbers = @(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

#Iterate through the array using a ForEach loop
foreach ($num in $numbers) {

    #Create a new variable to store the square of each number
    $squared = $num * $num

    #Print out the square of each number with a message
    Write-Host ("The square of " + $num + " is " + $squared)
}

#Output:
#The square of 1 is 1
#The square of 2 is 4
#The square of 3 is 9
#The square of 4 is 16
#The square of 5 is 25
