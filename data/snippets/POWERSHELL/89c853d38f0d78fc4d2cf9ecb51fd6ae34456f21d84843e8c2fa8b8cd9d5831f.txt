# This code snippet uses PowerShell to generate a list of installed software on a local machine
# It uses the Get-WMIObject cmdlet to query the WMI Class Win32_Product, which contains a list of installed software
# The output is saved to a variable $SoftwareList which is then displayed using the Write-Output cmdlet

# Get a list of installed software
$SoftwareList = Get-WMIObject -Class Win32_Product

# Loop through the list and extract the Name, Version, and Vendor for each software
foreach ($Software in $SoftwareList) {
  $SoftwareName = $Software.Name
  $SoftwareVersion = $Software.Version
  $SoftwareVendor = $Software.Vendor

  # Display the information in a formatted output
  Write-Output "Name: $SoftwareName | Version: $SoftwareVersion | Vendor: $SoftwareVendor"
}
