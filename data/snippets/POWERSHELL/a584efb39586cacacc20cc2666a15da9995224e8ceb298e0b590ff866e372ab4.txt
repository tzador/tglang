# This code snippet is a for loop that iterates through a list of numbers and prints out the square of each number

# Creating the list of numbers
$numbers = @(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Defining the for loop with a variable for the current index
for ($i=0; $i -lt $numbers.Count; $i++) {

    # Squaring the current number and assigning it to a variable
    $result = $numbers[$i] * $numbers[$i]

    # Printing out the squared number with a label for identification
    Write-Output "The square of $($numbers[$i]) is $($result)"
}
