# This code snippet will create a function that generates a random password and adds it to a new object in Active Directory.

# Import the Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Define the function called "New-RandomPassword"
Function New-RandomPassword {

# Set the parameters for the function, including the desired length and type of password
