# This code snippet creates an array of numbers and calculates their sum.
# The output will be the sum of the numbers.

# Define the array of numbers
$numbers = @(
    2, 5, 7, 10, 1, 8, 4
)

# Define a variable to hold the sum
$sum = 0

# Loop through the array and add each number to the sum
foreach ($number in $numbers) {
    $sum += $number
}

# Output the sum
$sum

# Expected Output: 37
