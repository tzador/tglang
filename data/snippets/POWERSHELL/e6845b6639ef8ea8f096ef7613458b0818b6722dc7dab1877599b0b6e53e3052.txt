# This is a complex code snippet that uses PowerShell to iterate through an array of numbers, filter out even numbers, and square each number in the array.

# Declare an array of numbers
$numbers = @(5, 9, 2, 8, 13, 6, 17)

# Use a for loop to iterate through each number in the array
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $numbers.Length; $i++)
{
    # Check if the number is even
    if ($numbers[$i] % 2 -eq 0)
    {
        # Square the number
        $numbers[$i] = $numbers[$i] * $numbers[$i]
    }
}

# Print the updated array
Write-Host "Updated array:"
Write-Host $numbers

# Output:
#
