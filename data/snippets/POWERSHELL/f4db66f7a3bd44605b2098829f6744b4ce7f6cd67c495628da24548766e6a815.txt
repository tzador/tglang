# This script calculates the area of a rectangle
# It takes in user input for the length and width
# and outputs the calculated area in a user-friendly message

# Define variables for length and width
$length = Read-Host "Enter the length of the rectangle:"
$width = Read-Host "Enter the width of the rectangle:"

# Calculate the area using the formula length * width
$area = $length * $width

# Output the result in a user-friendly message
