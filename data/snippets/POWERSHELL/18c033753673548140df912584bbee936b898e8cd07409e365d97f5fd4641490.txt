.SYNOPSIS
This is a code snippet that uses PowerShell to collect information about the processes running on the system and export it to a CSV file.

.DESCRIPTION
The code snippet first creates an array to store the output. Then it uses the Get-Process command to retrieve all the processes running on the system and stores the results in the array. Finally, it exports the array to a CSV file using the Export-Csv command.

.OUTPUTS
A CSV file containing information about the processes running on the system.

.EXAMPLE
#>
$processes = @() # Creates an empty array to store the output
 
Get-Process | ForEach-Object {
    $properties = @{ # Creates a hash table to store the process properties
        Name = $_.Name
        Id = $_.Id
        CPU = $_.CPU
        Memory = $_.WorkingSet
    }

    $processes += New-Object PSObject -Property $properties # Adds the hash table to the array
}
 
$processes | Export-Csv <output_path> -NoTypeInformation # Exports the array to a CSV file at the specified output path with no type information included
