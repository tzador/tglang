# This code snippet uses the PowerShell scripting language to copy files from one location to another

# Define the source and destination paths
$sourcePath = "C:\Users\Example\Documents"
$destinationPath = "C:\Users\Example\Downloads"

# Check if the source path exists
if (Test-Path $sourcePath) {

    # Create a new folder in the destination location
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $destinationPath\NewFolder

    # Get all files in the source path
    $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $sourcePath

    # Loop through each file
    ForEach ($file in $files) {

        # Copy the file to the destination path
        Copy-Item -Path $file.FullName -Destination $destinationPath\NewFolder -Force

        # Check if the file was successfully copied
        if (Test-Path $destinationPath\NewFolder\$file.Name) {
            Write-Host "$($file.Name) was successfully copied to $destinationPath\NewFolder"
        } else {
