# This code snippet uses the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to recursively search for files with the .txt extension, and then outputs the size and creation date of each file.

# Set the initial directory to search in
$directory = "C:\Files"

# Use the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to get all files with the .txt extension in the current directory and all subdirectories
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $directory -Filter *.txt -Recurse

# Loop through each file and display its size and creation date
foreach ($file in $files) {
    Write-Host "File name: $file"
    Write-Host "Size (bytes): $file.Length"
    Write-Host "Creation Date: $file.CreationTime"
