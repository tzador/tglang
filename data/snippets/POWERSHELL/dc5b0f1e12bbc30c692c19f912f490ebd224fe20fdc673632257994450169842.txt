# This is a Powershell script that generates a random password and saves it to a text file

# First, we create a new random string of 12 characters
$chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*()_+='
$rand = New-Object System.Random
$password = -join ($chars.Split("") | Get-Random -Count 12)

# Next, we create a text file and write the password to it
$fileName = "password.txt"
$file = New-Item -Path "C:\Users\Username\Desktop\" -Name $fileName -ItemType file
Add-Content $file $password

# Finally, we output the password to the console
Write-Host "Your generated password is: $password"

# This script can be run in Powershell by entering "pwsh <script_name>.ps1"
