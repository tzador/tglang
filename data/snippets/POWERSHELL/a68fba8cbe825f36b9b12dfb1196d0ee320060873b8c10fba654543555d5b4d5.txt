# This code snippet demonstrates how to search for files with the .txt extension in a specified directory and copy them to a new folder.

# Define the source and destination directories
$sourceDirectory = "C:\Users\Username\Documents"
$destinationDirectory = "C:\Users\Username\Documents\New Folder"

# Create a new folder if it doesn't already exist
if (!(Test-Path -Path $destinationDirectory))
{
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $destinationDirectory
}

# Search for files with the .txt extension in the source directory
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $sourceDirectory -Filter *.txt -Recurse

# Iterate through the files
foreach ($file in $files)
{
    # Copy the file to the destination directory
    Copy-Item -Path $file.FullName -Destination $destinationDirectory

    # Display a message to indicate that the file has been copied
    Write-Host "Copied file: $file"
}
