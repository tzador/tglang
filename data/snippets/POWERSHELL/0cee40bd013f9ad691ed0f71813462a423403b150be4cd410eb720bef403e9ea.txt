# This is a powershell script that iterates through a list of files, copies them to a destination folder, and appends a unique timestamp to the end of each file name
# Note: Replace the placeholders with actual paths and file extensions before running the code
# Place the files to be copied in $SourcePath and specify the destination folder in $DestPath

# Get current date and time in the required format
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss"

# Specify the source path where the files to be copied are located
$SourcePath = "C:\Users\Username\Documents\FilesToCopy\"

# Specify the destination path where the files will be copied to
$DestPath = "C:\Users\Username\Documents\CopiedFiles\"

# Create an array to store the names of all the files in the source path
$fileNames = Get-ChildItem -Path $SourcePath | Select-Object Name

# Loop through each file in the array
foreach ($file in $fileNames) {

    # Get the full path of the current file
    $fullPath = $SourcePath + $file.Name

    # Get the file extension of the current file
    $fileExtension = $file.Name.Split(".")[-1]

    # Specify the new file name with the unique timestamp appended to it
    $newFileName = $file.Name + "_" + $timestamp + "." + $fileExtension

    # Copy the file to the destination folder with the new file name
    Copy-Item $fullPath $DestPath\$newFileName
    
    # Output the file name and its new name to the console
    Write-Host "Copied file: " $file.Name " as: " $newFileName
