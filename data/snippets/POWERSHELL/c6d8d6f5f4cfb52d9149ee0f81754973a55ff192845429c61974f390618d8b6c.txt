# This is a complex code snippet in PowerShell that uses various string manipulation methods and control structures.
# The code creates a list of user names, checks for any duplicate names, and prints the unique names to the console.
# It also handles any errors that may occur during the process.

# Declare an array of user names
$users = @("John", "Mark", "Sarah", "John", "Emily", "David", "Mark", "James", "Lily", "Michael")

# Create an empty array to store unique names
$uniqueNames = @()

# Loop through each user name in the array
foreach($user in $users){

    # Check if the user name is already in the unique names array
    if($uniqueNames -contains $user){

        # If it is, print an error message
        Write-Host "Duplicate name found: $user. Please remove or change this name."

        # Exit the loop
        break

    } else{

        # If not, add the name to the unique names array
        $uniqueNames += $user
    }
}

# Check if any duplicate names were found
if($user -ne $null){

    # If yes, print a message and exit the script
    Write-Host "Script terminated due to duplicate name(s) found."
    exit
}

# If no duplicates were found, print the unique names to the console
Write-Host "Unique names: $uniqueNames"
