# This is a complex PowerShell code snippet that creates a new user in Active Directory 
# and sets their password to a randomly generated value
# It assumes you have already connected to your AD server using the "Connect-ADServiceAccount" cmdlet

# Define variables for the user's first and last name, as well as the password length
$firstName = "John"
$lastName = "Smith"
$pwdLength = 12

# Generate a secure random password using PowerShell's "Get-Random" cmdlet
$password = [System.Web.Security.Membership]::GeneratePassword($pwdLength,3)

# Create a new AD user with the given first and last name
New-ADUser -Name "$firstName $lastName" -GivenName $firstName -Surname $lastName -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText $password -Force)

# Output the user's password for later use (optional)
$password

# Lastly, enable the user's account and set their password to expire after 90 days
Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity "$firstName $lastName" -NewPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText $password -Force) -Reset
Set-ADUser -Identity "$firstName $lastName" -Enabled $true -PasswordNeverExpires $false -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true
