# This code snippet creates a function in PowerShell to calculate the factorial of a given number

function Get-Factorial {
   param (
      [Parameter(Mandatory=$true, Position=1)]
      [int]$number
   )

   # Define variables
   $result = 1
   $i = 2

   # Use a while loop to continuously multiply the result by the current number and increment the number by 1 until it reaches the given number
   while ($i -le $number) {
      $result = $result * $i
      $i++
   }

   # Return the result
   return $result
}

# Call the function and assign its output to a variable
$factorial = Get-Factorial 5

# Print the result
Write-Host $factorial

# Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
