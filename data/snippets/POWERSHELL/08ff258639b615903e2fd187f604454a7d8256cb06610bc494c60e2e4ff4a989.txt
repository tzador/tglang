# This code snippet takes in a list of file names, loops through each file, and prints out their file size and last modified date.

# Define an array of file names
$files = @("file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt")

# Loop through each file and get file size
foreach ($file in $files) {
    # Use Get-Item cmdlet to get file size and store it in a variable
    $size = Get-Item $file | Select-Object -Expand Size

    # Use Get-ItemProperty cmdlet to get last modified date and store it in a variable
    $modifiedDate = Get-ItemProperty $file | Select-Object -Expand LastWriteTime

    # Print out file size and last modified date in a formatted string
    Write-Host "File: $file has a size of $size and was last modified on $modifiedDate"
}
