# This code snippet generates a random password using an array of characters and numbers
# Note: This is for educational purposes only, for stronger passwords use a more advanced algorithm

# Define array of characters and numbers
$chars = 0..9 + 'a'..'z' + 'A'..'Z' + '!@#$%^&*()' 

# Define password length 
$pwd_length = 10 

# Generate password by randomly selecting characters from the array
$password = -join ($chars | Get-Random -Count $pwd_length)

# Output password
$password
