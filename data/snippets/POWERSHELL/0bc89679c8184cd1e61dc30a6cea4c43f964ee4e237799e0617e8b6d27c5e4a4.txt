# This script calculates the average of a list of numbers

# Define the list of numbers
$numbers = [12, 15, 18, 9, 6, 10, 15]

# Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the numbers
$sum = 0

# Loop through the numbers and add each to the sum
foreach ($number in $numbers) {
    $sum += $number
}

# Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total number of numbers
$average = $sum / $numbers.Count

# Print out the average
Write-Host "The average of the list is: $average"
