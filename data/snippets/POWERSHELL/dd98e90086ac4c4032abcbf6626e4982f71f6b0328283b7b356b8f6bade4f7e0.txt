# This code snippet uses the Get-PSSnapin cmdlet to get information about PowerShell snap-ins
# It then uses the ForEach-Object cmdlet to loop through each snap-in and display relevant information

Get-PSSnapin | ForEach-Object {
    # Store snap-in name in $snapin variable
    $snapin = $_.Name
    # Store snap-in version in $version variable
    $version = $_.Version
    # Store snap-in description in $description variable
    $description = $_.Description
    # Store snap-in status (loaded or unloaded) in $status variable
    $status = $_.Loaded

    # Output snap-in information in Markdown format
    Write-Host "#### Snap-in Name: **$snapin**"
    Write-Host "Version: $version"
    Write-Host "Description: $description"
    Write-Host "Status: $status"
