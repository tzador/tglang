#This code snippet demonstrates a for loop in PowerShell that iterates through a list of users and adds them to a group

#Define an array of users
$users = @("John", "Jane", "Mark", "Emily", "David")

#Define the group name and add the users to the group
$groupName = "Administrators"
foreach($user in $users) {
    Add-ADGroupMember -Identity $groupName -Members $user
}

#Display a confirmation message
Write-Host "Users successfully added to $groupName"
