# This code snippet creates a function in PowerShell that calculates the factorial of a given number.

# Define the function name and parameters
function Get-Factorial {
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)] [int] $number
    )

    # Check if the number is 0, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
    if ($number -eq 0) {
        return 1
    }

    # Define a variable to store the result and set it to the number
    $result = $number
    
    # Loop through the numbers starting from 1 and multiply the result with each number
    for ($i = 2; $i -le $number; $i++) {
        $result *= $i
    }

    # Return the final result
    return $result
}

# Call the function with a given number
$factorial = Get-Factorial 5

# Print out the calculated factorial
Write-Output "The factorial of 5 is $factorial"

# Output:
# The factorial of 5 is 120
