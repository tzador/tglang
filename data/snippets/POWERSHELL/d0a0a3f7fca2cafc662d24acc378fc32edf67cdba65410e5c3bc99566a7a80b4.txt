# This code snippet is a recursive function in PowerShell that calculates the factorial of a given number.

# Define the recursive function
function Factorial {
    param(
        [int]$number # Parameter for the number whose factorial is to be calculated
    )

    # Base case
    if ($number -eq 1) {
        return 1
    }

    # Recursive case
    else {
        return $number * (Factorial ($number - 1))
    }
}

# Prompt user for input
Write-Host "Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "

# Read input
$number = Read-Host

# Check if input is a valid number
if (-not [int]::TryParse($number, [ref]$null)) {
    Write-Host "Invalid input, please enter a valid number."
}

# If input is valid, calculate factorial
else {
    $factorial = Factorial $number

    # Print result
    Write-Host "The factorial of $number is $factorial."
}
