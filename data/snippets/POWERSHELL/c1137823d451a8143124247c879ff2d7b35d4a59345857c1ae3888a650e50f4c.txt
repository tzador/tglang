#This code snippet is a program that takes in a list of numbers and returns the total sum of those numbers

#Create an empty array to store the input numbers
$numbers = @()

#Prompt the user to input the numbers
Write-Host "Enter a list of numbers, separated by commas:"

#Store the input numbers in a variable
$input = Read-Host

#Split the input by commas and store the individual numbers in the array
$numbers = $input -split ","

#Create a variable to store the sum of the numbers
$sum = 0

#Loop through the array and add each number to the sum variable
foreach ($number in $numbers){
    $sum += [int]$number
}

#Print the sum to the console
