#Generating a password with specific length and character types

#Create variable for password length
$length = 12

#Create variable for password characters
$chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()"

#Create an empty string for the password
$password = ""

#Use a for loop to generate the password
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $length; $i++){

    #Get a random number between 0 and the length of the characters string
    $index = Get-Random -Minimum 0 -Maximum $chars.Length

    #Add a random character from the characters string to the password string
    $password += $chars[$index]
}

#Output the generated password
Write-Output "Password: $password"
