# This code snippet will list all the files within a specified directory and create a new directory with the file names
# and their modified dates as subdirectories and files within them.

# Set the path of directory to be listed
$dirPath = "C:\Users\Documents"

# Create an array to store the file names
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $dirPath -File | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name

# Loop through the files array and create a new directory for each file
foreach ($file in $files) {
    # Create the directory name using the file's name and modified date
    $dirName = "$file $(Get-ChildItem -Path ($dirPath + "\" + $file) | Select-Object -ExpandProperty LastWriteTime)"
    # Create the new directory
    New-Item -Path $dirPath -Name $dirName -ItemType Directory
    # Copy the file into the new directory
    Copy-Item ($dirPath + "\" + $file) -Destination ($dirPath + "\" + $dirName)
}
# Output:
# A new directory will be created for each file in the specified directory, with the format of "File Name Modified Date", 
# and the file will be copied into the new directory as well. This code snippet can be modified to suit specific needs, 
# such as only creating directories for specific file types or including more details in the directory name.
