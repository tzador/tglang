#This snippet uses PowerShell to create a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

#Define the function with the parameter for the number
function factorial ($num) {

    #Assign a variable to the starting value of the factorial
    $factorial = 1

    #Run a for loop to iterate through the numbers leading up to the given number
    for ($i = 1; $i -le $num; $i++) {

        #Multiply the current factorial value by the number for each iteration
        $factorial *= $i
    }

    #Output the final calculated factorial
    $factorial
}

#Call the function with a given number and store the output in a variable
$result = factorial 5

#Print the result
$result
