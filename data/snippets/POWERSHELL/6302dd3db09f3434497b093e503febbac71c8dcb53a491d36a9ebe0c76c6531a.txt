# This is a sample Powershell code snippet that creates a new directory, sets
# the current directory as the working directory, and copies a file into the
# created directory.

# Create a new directory with the name "NewDirectory"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Name "NewDirectory"

# Set the current directory as the working directory
Set-Location -Path $PSScriptRoot

# Copy file "Example.txt" into the created "NewDirectory" directory
Copy-Item -Path .\Example.txt -Destination .\NewDirectory
