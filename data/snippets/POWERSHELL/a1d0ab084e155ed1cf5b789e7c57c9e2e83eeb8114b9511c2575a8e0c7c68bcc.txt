# This script retrieves data from a CSV file and calculates the average of a specific column
# Import the CSV data
$data = Import-Csv -Path C:\users\username\Documents\data.csv

# Initialize variables
$count = 0
$total = 0

# Loop through each row in the CSV
foreach ($row in $data) {
    # Check if the row contains the column we want to calculate the average of
    if ($row.'sales amount') {
        # Convert the value to an integer
        $salesAmount = [int]$row.'sales amount'
        # Add the value to the total
        $total += $salesAmount
        # Increase the count by 1
        $count++
    }
}

# Calculate the average by dividing the total by the count
$average = $total / $count

# Print the average
Write-Output "The average sales amount is $average"
