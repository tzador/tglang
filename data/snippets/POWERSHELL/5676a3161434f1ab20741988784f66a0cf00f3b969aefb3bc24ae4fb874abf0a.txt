# This code snippet uses PowerShell to iterate through a directory and list all files with their respective size and attributes

# Define the directory to iterate through
$dir = "C:\Users\User\Documents"

# Use the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to get a list of all files in the directory
$fileList = Get-ChildItem $dir

# Loop through each file and print the file name, size, and attributes
foreach ($file in $fileList) {

    # Use the Select-Object cmdlet to select specific properties of the file
    $fileInfo = $file | Select-Object Name, Length, Attributes

    # Print the file name, size, and attributes in a formatted string
    Write-Host "File Name: $($fileInfo.Name) | File Size: $($fileInfo.Length) bytes | Attributes: $($fileInfo.Attributes)"
