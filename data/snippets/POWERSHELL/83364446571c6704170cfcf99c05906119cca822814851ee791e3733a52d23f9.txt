# This code snippet will get the size of each file in a directory and output it in a table

# First, we specify the directory we want to get the file size from
$directory = "C:\Users\JohnDoe\Documents"

# Next, we use the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to get all the files in the specified directory
# and store them in the $files variable
$files = Get-ChildItem $directory

# We then create an empty array to store the file size and name
$fileSizes = @()

# We use a foreach loop to iterate through each file in the $files variable
foreach ($file in $files) {
    # We use the Measure-Object cmdlet to get the file size and store it in a variable
    $size = (Get-ChildItem $file.FullName | Measure-Object -Property Length).Sum

    # We create an object with the file name and size and add it to the $fileSizes array
    $fileObject = New-Object -TypeName PSObject
    $fileObject | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "FileName" -Value $file.Name
    $fileObject | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "Size (bytes)" -Value $size
    $fileSizes += $fileObject
}

# Finally, we output the file size in a table format using the Format-Table cmdlet
$fileSizes | Format-Table -AutoSize

# The output will be in the following format:
# FileName   | Size (bytes)
# -------------------------
# file1.txt  | 245
# file2.pdf  | 1258
# file3.docx | 3568
# ...        | ...
