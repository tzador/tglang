task processData(type: JavaExec) {
    main = 'com.example.ProcessData'
    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath

    def inputFile = file('data/input.txt')
    def outputFile = file('data/output.txt')

    args inputFile, outputFile
}

//Explanation: 
This code snippet creates a task called "processData" of type JavaExec.
It sets the main class to be executed as "com.example.ProcessData".
The classpath is set to the runtime classpath of the "main" source set.
It then defines two variables for the input and output files.
The "args" property is used to pass these files as arguments to the main class when the task is executed.
