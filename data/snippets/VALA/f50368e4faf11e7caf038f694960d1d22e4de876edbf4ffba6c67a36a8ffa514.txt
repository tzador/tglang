/* This is a sample VALA code snippet */ 

// Creating a class called Person

	// Define variables
	private string name;
	private int age;
	
	//Define constructor
	public Person (string n, int a) {
		name = n;
		age = a;
	}

	//Define method to print person's information
	public void printPersonInfo() { 
		stdio.printf("Name: %s, Age: %d", name, age);
	}

	//Define method to check if person is a minor
	public bool isMinor() {

}

// Creating an instance of Person class
Person john = new Person("John", 21);

/* Output:
In this code snippet, we declare a class called Person in VALA.
First, we define private variables for the name and age of a person.
Next, we define a constructor that takes in a name and age and sets the class variables accordingly.
Then, we define a method to print out the person's information using the standard input/output library in VALA.
Finally, we define a method to check if the person is a minor by returning a boolean value based on their age.
To test the code, we create an instance of the Person class with the name "John" and age 21.
