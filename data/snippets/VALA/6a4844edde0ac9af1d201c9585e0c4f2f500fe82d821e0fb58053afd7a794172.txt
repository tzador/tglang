// This code snippet creates a class "Person" with private variables and a public function to print the person's name and age

class Person : Object {
    private string name; // private variable for person's name
    private int age; // private variable for person's age

    // constructor for the Person class

    // method to print the person's name and age
    public void print_person () {

// create an instance of the Person class with name "John" and age 25
var john = new Person ("John", 25);

// call the print_person method to print John's name and age
