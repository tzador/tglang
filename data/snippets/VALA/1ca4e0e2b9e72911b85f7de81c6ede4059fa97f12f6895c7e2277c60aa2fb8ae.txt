//This is a long and complex code snippet in VALA
//The code below creates a custom class called Person
//which has properties for name, age, and occupation

public class Person {
    //Private fields
    private string name; //representing the person's name
    private int age; //representing the person's age
    private string occupation; //representing the person's occupation

    //Constructor
    public Person (string name, int age, string occupation) {
        //Set the private fields to the given values
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.occupation = occupation;
    }

    //Public method to get the person's name
    public string get_name () {
        return this.name;
    }

    //Public method to set the person's name
    public void set_name (string name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    //Public method to get the person's age
    public int get_age () {
        return this.age;
    }

    //Public method to set the person's age
    public void set_age (int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    //Public method to get the person's occupation
    public string get_occupation () {
        return this.occupation;
    }

    //Public method to set the person's occupation
    public void set_occupation (string occupation) {
        this.occupation = occupation;
    }
}

//Example usage of the Person class
Person john = new Person("John", 25, "Software Engineer"); //Create a new Person object
print("Name: " + john.get_name()); //Print the person's name
print("Age: " + john.get_age()); //Print the person's age
print("Occupation: " + john.get_occupation()); //Print the person's occupation
