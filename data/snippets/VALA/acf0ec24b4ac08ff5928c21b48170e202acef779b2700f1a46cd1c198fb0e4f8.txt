// This code snippet is a simple program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion

// Define a function that takes an integer as argument and returns its factorial
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1; // Base case, factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive call, multiply n with factorial of n-1
    }
}

void main() {
    // Define a variable to store the number whose factorial we want to find
    int num = 5;

    // Call the factorial function and store the result in a variable
    int result = factorial(num);

    // Print the result to the console
    print(@"The factorial of %d is %d", num, result);
