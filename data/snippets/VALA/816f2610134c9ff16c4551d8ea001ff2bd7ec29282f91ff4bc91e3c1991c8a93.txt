Explanation: This code snippet generates a Fibonacci series up to the number of terms specified by the variable 'n'. The 'main' function first initializes variables for the first two terms, 'first' and 'second', and then uses a for loop to generate and print the next terms in the series. The loop continues until the number of terms generated reaches 'n'. The 'fib' variable is used to calculate the next term in the series by adding the previous two terms. Each term is printed on a new line using the 'print' function, with the format "%d\n" which indicates an integer followed by a new line. Therefore, the output with n = 5 is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, which is the first five terms of the Fibonacci series.
