/* This program demonstrates how to use a for loop to calculate the factorial of a number */

// Define a constant for the number to calculate factorial
const int NUM = 5;

// Define variable to store the result
int result = 1;

// Start the for loop from 1 to NUM, incrementing by 1
for (int i = 1; i <= NUM; i++)
{
  // Update the result by multiplying with the current value of i
  result *= i;
}

// Print the result to the console
stdout.printf("The factorial of %d is %d", NUM, result);
