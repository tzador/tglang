# Welcome to the Ruby Programming Language!
# Below is a complex code snippet that uses an algorithm to find the sum of the squares of an array of numbers.

def sum_of_squares(array)
  # Initializing variables
  sum = 0
  index = 0

  # Looping through the array
  while index < array.length
    # Squaring the current number and adding it to the sum variable
    sum += (array[index])**2
    # Incrementing the index variable
    index += 1
  end

  # Returning the sum of squares of the array
  return sum
end

# Example array
example_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Calling the sum_of_squares method and storing the result in a variable
result = sum_of_squares(example_array)
# Expected Output: 55

# Printing the result
puts result #=> 55
