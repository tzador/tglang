# This code snippet implements a method to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion

# define a method called factorial that takes in a positive integer
def factorial(num)
 # base case: if number is 0 or 1, return 1
  if num == 0 || num == 1
    return 1
  # if number is greater than 1, recursively call factorial method and multiply by current number
  else
    return num * factorial(num - 1)
  end
end

# prompt user for input and convert it to an integer
print "Enter a positive integer: "
num = gets.chomp.to_i

# call factorial method and print the result
puts "The factorial of #{num} is: #{factorial(num)}"

# Output: The factorial of 5 is: 120
