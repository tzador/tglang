# This is a program that uses the Newton-Raphson algorithm to find the root of a given function.
# It takes in the function, its derivative and a starting point as inputs.

# Define the function and its derivative
def function(x)
  return x**3 - 2*x - 5
end

def derivative(x)
  return 3*x**2 - 2
end

# Define the initial guess or starting point
x0 = 2.5

# Define a tolerance level for the root
tolerance = 0.0001

# Initialize the root to the starting point
root = x0

# Create a loop to iteratively calculate the root using Newton-Raphson algorithm
loop do
  # Calculate the new root using the formula: root = old_root - f(x)/f'(x)
  root = root - function(root)/derivative(root)

  # Calculate the difference between the new and old root
  difference = (root - x0).abs

  # Break out of the loop once the difference is smaller than the tolerance level
  break if difference < tolerance

  # Update x0 to the new root value for the next iteration
  x0 = root
end

# Print out the final root value
puts "The root of the function is: #{root}"
