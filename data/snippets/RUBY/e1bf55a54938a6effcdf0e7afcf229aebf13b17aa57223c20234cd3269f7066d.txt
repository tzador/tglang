# This is a complex Ruby code snippet that demonstrates the use of modules, classes, inheritance, and method overriding
# It creates a parent class named 'Animal' with attributes and methods, and then creates a child class named 'Dog' which inherits from the 'Animal' class and overrides one of its methods

# defining the parent 'Animal' class
class Animal
  # setting the attributes of the class
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :color

  # defining the constructor method
  def initialize(name, age, color)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @color = color
  end

  # defining a method to make the animal move
  def move
    puts "#{@name} is moving around."
  end

  # defining a method to make the animal make a sound
  def make_sound
    puts "#{@name} is making a sound."
  end
end

# defining the child 'Dog' class, which inherits from the 'Animal' class
class Dog < Animal
  # overriding the 'make_sound' method of the 'Animal' class
  def make_sound
    puts "#{@name} is barking loudly!"
  end
end

# creating an instance of the 'Animal' class
animal = Animal.new("Max", 5, "brown")
# calling the 'move' method on the 'animal' instance
animal.move
# calling the 'make_sound' method on the 'animal' instance
animal.make_sound

# creating an instance of the 'Dog' class
dog = Dog.new("Buddy", 3, "black")
# calling the 'move' method on the 'dog' instance
dog.move
# calling the 'make_sound' method on the 'dog' instance
dog.make_sound
