# This code snippet demonstrates how to create a class with a constructor method, instance variables and instance methods in Ruby.
class Animal
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :species

  # Constructor method for the Animal class.
  def initialize(name, age, species)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @species = species
  end

  # Instance method to display information about the animal.
  def display_info
    puts "Name: #{@name}"
    puts "Age: #{@age}"
    puts "Species: #{@species}"
  end

  # Instance method to check if the animal can speak.
  def speak
    if @species == "Dog"
      puts "#{@name} barks."
    elsif @species == "Cat"
      puts "#{@name} meows."
    elsif @species == "Bird"
      puts "#{@name} chirps."
    else
      puts "#{@name} does not know how to speak."
    end
  end

  # Instance method to calculate the age of the animal in human years.
  def human_years
    if @species == "Dog"
      human_years = @age * 7
    elsif @species == "Cat"
      human_years = @age * 5
    elsif @species == "Bird"
      human_years = @age * 2.5
    else
      human_years = "Cannot calculate human years for this species."
    end

    puts "#{@name} is equivalent to #{human_years} human years."
  end
end

# Create instances of the Animal class
dog = Animal.new("Buddy", 3, "Dog")
cat = Animal.new("Fluffy", 5, "Cat")
bird = Animal.new("Tweetie", 1.5, "Bird")

# Call the instance methods for each animal.
dog.display_info # Output: Name: Buddy
                 #         Age: 3
                 #         Species: Dog
cat.display_info # Output: Name: Fluffy
                 #         Age: 5
                 #         Species: Cat
bird.display_info # Output: Name: Tweetie
                 #         Age: 1.5
                 #         Species: Bird

dog.speak # Output: Buddy barks.
cat.speak # Output: Fluffy meows.
bird.speak # Output: Tweetie chirps.

dog.human_years # Output: Buddy is equivalent to 21 human years.
cat.human_years # Output: Fluffy is equivalent to 25 human years.
bird.human_years # Output: Tweetie is equivalent to 3.75 human years.
