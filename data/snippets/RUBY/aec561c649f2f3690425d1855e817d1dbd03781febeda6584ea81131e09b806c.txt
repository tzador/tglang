# This code snippet is a method that takes in an array of numbers and returns the square of each number as a new array.
def square_array(array)
  squares = [] # creates an empty array to store the squared numbers
  for num in array # iterates through each number in the given array
    squares << num ** 2 # squares the number and adds it to the new array
  end
  return squares # returns the new array with squared numbers
end

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
puts square_array(numbers) #=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
