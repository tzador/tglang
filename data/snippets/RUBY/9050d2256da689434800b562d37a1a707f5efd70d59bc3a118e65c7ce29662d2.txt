# This is a function called 'calculate_fibonacci' that takes in one parameter 'n'
# and returns an array of the first 'n' numbers in the Fibonacci sequence

def calculate_fibonacci(n)
  # Set the first two numbers in the sequence
  fibonacci_numbers = [0, 1]

  # Loop through 'n' times, starting at index 2 
  (2..n).each do |index|
    # Calculate the next number by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence
    next_number = fibonacci_numbers[index - 1] + fibonacci_numbers[index - 2]
    # Add the next number to the array of Fibonacci numbers
    fibonacci_numbers << next_number
  end

  # Return the first 'n' numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
  return fibonacci_numbers.take(n)
end

# Call the function and pass in a value for 'n'
calculate_fibonacci(10)

# Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
