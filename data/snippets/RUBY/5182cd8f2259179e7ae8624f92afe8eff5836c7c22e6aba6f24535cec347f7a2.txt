# This code snippet creates a class called "Animal" that has two attributes,
# "name" and "species", and three methods, "introduce", "eat", and "sleep".

# Define the class "Animal" with the attributes "name" and "species"
class Animal
  attr_accessor :name, :species

  # Define the "introduce" method that prints out the animal's name and species
  def introduce
    puts "Hi, my name is #{@name} and I am a #{@species}."
  end

  # Define the "eat" method that takes in a food parameter and prints out the animal's food preference
  def eat(food)
    puts "I like to eat #{food}."
  end

  # Define the "sleep" method that prints out a sleeping message
  def sleep
    puts "Zzzz...I am sleeping."
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Animal class with the name "Max" and species "dog"
animal = Animal.new
animal.name = "Max"
animal.species = "dog"

# Call the "introduce" method of the animal instance
animal.introduce

# Call the "eat" method of the animal instance with "bones" as the food parameter
animal.eat("bones")

# Call the "sleep" method of the animal instance
animal.sleep
