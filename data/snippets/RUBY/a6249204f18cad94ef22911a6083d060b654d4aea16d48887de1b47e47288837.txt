# This is a function that takes in a number and returns the sum of all numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
# Example:
# input: 10
# output: 33 (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13)

# Define the function
def fibonacci_sum(number)
  
  # Initialize variables for the first two numbers in the sequence
  first = 1
  second = 1
  
  # Initialize the sum variable
  sum = 0
  
  # Keep looping until the current number is greater than the input number
  while first <= number do
    
    # Add the current number (first) to the sum
    sum += first
    
    # Update the variables for the next number in the sequence
    temp = first
    first = second
    second = temp + second
  end
  
  # Return the sum
  return sum
end

# Call the function and print the output
puts fibonacci_sum(10)
