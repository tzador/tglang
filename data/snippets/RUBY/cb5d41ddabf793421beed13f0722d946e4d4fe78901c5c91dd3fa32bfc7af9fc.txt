# This code creates a class called 'Student' with attributes 'name', 'age', and 'major'

class Student
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :major
  def initialize(name, age, major)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @major = major
  end
end

# This code creates two instances of the 'Student' class and sets their attributes using getters and setters

student1 = Student.new("John", 21, "Computer Science")
student2 = Student.new("Emily", 19, "Chemistry")

# This code adds a new method to the 'Student' class that prints out a customized message using the student's information

class Student
  def print_info
    puts "#{@name} is #{@age} years old and is majoring in #{@major}."
  end
end

# This code calls the 'print_info' method on the two instances of the 'Student' class, printing out their information

student1.print_info
student2.print_info
