# The above code defines a method 'factorial' that takes in an integer 'n' 
# The 'if' statement checks if the integer is 0, in which case it returns 1 
# If the integer is not 0, it recursively calls the 'factorial' method, passing in 'n-1' as the parameter 
# This process continues until n reaches 0, and then the value 1 is returned 
# This code snippet demonstrates the use of recursion and conditional statements in Ruby.
