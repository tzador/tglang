# This code snippet creates a class called "Car" with attributes make, model, and year
class Car
  # this creates a getter and setter method for the attribute 'make'
  attr_accessor :make
  # this creates a getter and setter method for the attribute 'model'
  attr_accessor :model
  # this creates a getter and setter method for the attribute 'year'
  attr_accessor :year
  # this is the initialize method that takes in the arguments make, model, and year
  def initialize(make, model, year)
    # the arguments are set to be instance variables for the class
    @make = make
    @model = model
    @year = year
  end

  # this method formats the car object's attributes into a string
  def to_s
    # the string includes each attribute's corresponding value
  	"#{@year} #{@make} #{@model}"
  end
end

# creating new instances of the Car class
car1 = Car.new("Toyota", "Corolla", 2019)
car2 = Car.new("Honda", "Civic", 2020)

# calling the to_s method on car1, which will output a string with the car's attributes
puts car1.to_s # output: 2019 Toyota Corolla

# changing the make of car2 to "Ford"
car2.make = "Ford"

# calling the to_s method on car2 again, which will now reflect the updated make
puts car2.to_s # output: 2020 Ford Civic
