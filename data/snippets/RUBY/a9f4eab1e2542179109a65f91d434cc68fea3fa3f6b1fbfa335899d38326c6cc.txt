# This code snippet generates a class called "Person" with attributes for name, age, and occupation

class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :occupation

  # this method initializes a new instance of Person class with given name, age, and occupation attributes
  def initialize(name, age, occupation)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @occupation = occupation
  end

  # this method prints out the information of the person instance
  def print_info
    puts "#{@name} is #{@age} years old and works as a #{@occupation}"
  end
end

# creating a new instance of Person class
bob = Person.new("Bob", 30, "Software Engineer")

# calling print_info method to print out the person's information
bob.print_info

# output: "Bob is 30 years old and works as a Software Engineer"
