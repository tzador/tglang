# This code snippet is an example of a Ruby method that checks if a given number is prime

def is_prime(num)
  # Set the initial value of prime to true
  prime = true
  
  # Loop through numbers from 2 up to the given number - 1
  for i in 2..num-1
    # Check if the given number is divisible by the current number in the loop
    if num % i == 0
      # If it is, set prime to false
      prime = false
      # Exit the loop
      break
    end
  end
  
  # Check if prime is still true (meaning the number is not divisible by any number except for itself and 1)
  if prime == true
    # If so, print that the number is prime
    puts "#{num} is prime."
  else
    # If not, print that the number is not prime
    puts "#{num} is not prime."
  end
end

# Call the method with a given number
is_prime(17)

# Output: "17 is prime."
