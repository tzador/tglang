# This program takes two numbers as input and outputs their sum

# defining a method to add two numbers

end

# getting user input for first number

# converting input to integer and storing in variable 'num1'

# converting input to integer and storing in variable 'num2'
num2 = gets.chomp.to_i

# calling add method with num1 and num2 as arguments
sum = add(num1, num2)

# printing the sum of the two numbers
puts "Sum of #{num1} and #{num2} is #{sum}."
