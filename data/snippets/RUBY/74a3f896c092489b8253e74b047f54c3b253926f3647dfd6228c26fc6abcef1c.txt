# This is a function that calculates the factorial of a number
def factorial(num)
  # The default value of the factorial is set to 1
  factorial = 1
  # Loop through all the numbers from 1 to num
  (1..num).each do |i|
    # Multiply the factorial by each number in the loop
    factorial *= i
  end
  # Return the final factorial value
  return factorial
end

# This is an example of calling the function and printing the result
puts "Factorial of 5 is #{factorial(5)}"

# Output:
# Factorial of 5 is 120
