#This is a code snippet in Ruby that creates a hash of students in a class and their grades

students = { "John": "A", "Jane": "B", "Mark": "C+", "Sarah": "A+", "Alex": "C" }

#This block of code iterates through the hash and calculates the average grade of the class
total_grades = 0
students.each do |name, grade|
  total_grades += grade
end

average_grade = total_grades / students.length

#This block of code prints out the name and grade of each student in the hash
students.each do |name, grade|
  puts "#{name} has a grade of #{grade}"
end

#This block of code determines the top performing student in the class
top_student = students.max_by { |name, grade| grade }

#This block of code prints out the top performing student and their grade
puts "The top performing student is #{top_student[0]} with a grade of #{top_student[1]}"
