# This code snippet creates a class called "Person" with three attributes and multiple methods

class Person  # defining the Person class
  attr_accessor :name, :age # creating attributes for name and age

  # initializing the attributes of the class 
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  # method to display the full name of the person
  def full_name
    "#{@name} #{@last_name}"
  end

  # method to check if the person is an adult based on age
  def is_adult?
    if @age >= 18 
      puts "#{@name} is an adult."
    else
      puts "#{@name} is not an adult."
    end
  end

  # method to compare the age of two people
  def compare_age(person)
    if @age > person.age
      puts "#{@name} is older than #{person.name}."
    elsif @age == person.age
      puts "#{@name} and #{person.name} are the same age."
    else
      puts "#{@name} is younger than #{person.name}."
    end
  end
end

# creating instances of the Person class
person1 = Person.new("John", 25)
person2 = Person.new("Mary", 30)

# calling methods on the instances
puts person1.full_name # output: John
person1.is_adult? # output: John is an adult.
person1.compare_age(person2) # output: John is younger than Mary.
