# This function takes in an array of numbers and finds the average
def find_average(arr)
    # Initialize a variable to store the total sum of all numbers in the array
    total_sum = 0

    # Loop through the array and add each number to the total sum
    arr.each do |num|
        total_sum += num
    end

    # Calculate the average by dividing the total sum by the length of the array
    average = total_sum / arr.length

    # Return the average
    return average
end

# Example usage: find_average([5, 10, 15, 20]) => 12.5
