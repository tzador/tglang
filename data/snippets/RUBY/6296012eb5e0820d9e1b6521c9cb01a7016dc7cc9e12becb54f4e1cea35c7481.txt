# This is a simple Ruby program that defines a class and creates an instance of it.
class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age

  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def introduce
    puts "Hi, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create a new instance of the Person class
person1 = Person.new("John", 25)

# Call the introduce method on the person1 instance
person1.introduce

# Output:
# Hi, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
