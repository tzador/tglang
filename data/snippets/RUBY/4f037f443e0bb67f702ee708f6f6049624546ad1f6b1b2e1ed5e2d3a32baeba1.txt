# This code snippet calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100

# Define a starting number
start = 1

# Define an ending number
stop = 100

# Initialize a variable to store the sum of even numbers
sum = 0

# Loop through all numbers between the starting and ending number
while start <= stop do
  # Check if the current number is even
  if start % 2 == 0
    # Add the current number to the sum variable if it is even
    sum += start
  end
  # Increment the starting number by 1
  start += 1
end

# Print the sum of even numbers
puts "The sum of even numbers between 1 and 100 is #{sum}"
