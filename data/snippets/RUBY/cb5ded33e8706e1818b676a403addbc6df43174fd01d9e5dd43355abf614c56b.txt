# This code snippet calculates the exponential function using recursion.

def exponential(base, power)
  # Base case: if the power is 0, the result is 1.
  return 1 if power == 0

  # Recursive case: multiply the base by the result of the exponential
  # function with the base and power reduced by 1.
  return base * exponential(base, power - 1)
end

# Example usage:
exponential(2, 5) #=> 32
exponential(3, 3) #=> 27
