# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
def factorial(n) # Defines a method called factorial that takes in a parameter n
  if n <= 1 # Checks if n is less than or equal to 1
    1 # Returns 1 if n is 1 or 0
  else 
    n * factorial(n-1) # Recursively calls the method with n-1 as the parameter and multiplies it with n
  end # Ends the if-else statement
end # Ends the method

puts factorial(5) # Outputs the factorial of 5
# Output: 120
