# This code snippet uses a map function to transform an array of integers
# into an array of strings, with each string representing the integer as a
# binary number with a leading '0b' prefix.

# Define the map function and pass in an array as an argument
map(numbers) do |n|

  # Convert the integer to a binary representation and add '0b' prefix
  "0b#{n.to_s(2)}"

end

# Output:
# ["0b1", "0b10", "0b11", "0b100", "0b101", "0b110", "0b111", "0b1000", "0b1001", "0b1010"]
