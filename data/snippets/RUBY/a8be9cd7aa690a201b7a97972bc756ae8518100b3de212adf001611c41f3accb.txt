#This method starts with a keyword "def" to define a new method
#The method is named "reverse_sentence" and takes in one parameter "sentence"
def reverse_sentence(sentence)
  #Create an array named "words" by splitting the sentence with a space using the "split" method
  words = sentence.split(" ")
  #Create an empty array named "reversed_words"

  #Start a loop using the "each" method on the "words" array
  words.each do |word|
    #Add each word to the beginning of the "reversed_words" array using the "unshift" method

#Print the result of calling the method by passing in a sentence as an argument and wrap it in puts for output
