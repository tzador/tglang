# This is a Ruby code snippet that creates a class called "Person"
class Person
  # Initialize method that takes in name and age parameters
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  # Getter method for name
  def name
    @name
  end

  # Setter method for age
  def age=(new_age)
    @age = new_age
  end

  # Method that checks if the person is an adult (over 18 years old)
  def is_adult?
    if @age > 18
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  # Method that greets the person

    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Creating a new instance of the Person class with the name "John" and age 25
john = Person.new("John", 25)
