# This code snippet generates a class called "Shape" with two methods for calculating perimeter and area.

class Shape
    # Initializing the shape with its dimensions.
    def initialize(length, breadth)
        @length = length
        @breadth = breadth
    end

    # Method to calculate perimeter of the shape.
    def calculate_perimeter
        perimeter = 2 * (@length + @breadth)
        puts "The perimeter of the shape is #{perimeter}."
    end

    # Method to calculate area of the shape.
    def calculate_area
        area = @length * @breadth
        puts "The area of the shape is #{area}."
    end
end

# Creating an instance of the Shape class with dimensions 5 and 10.
shape = Shape.new(5, 10)

# Calling the calculate_perimeter method.
shape.calculate_perimeter

# Calling the calculate_area method.
shape.calculate_area
