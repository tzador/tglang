# This is a example of a complex code snippet in Ruby

# Define a class called Person
class Person
  # Create a reader and writer method for the name attribute
  attr_accessor :name
  # Create a reader method for the age attribute
  attr_reader :age

  # Initialize method that takes in name and age parameters
  def initialize(name, age)
    # Set the name attribute to the name parameter
    @name = name
    # Set the age attribute to the age parameter
    @age = age
    # Create an instance variable for the person's hobbies
    @hobbies = []
  end

  # Method to add a hobby to the hobbies instance variable
  def add_hobby(hobby)
    @hobbies << hobby
  end

  # Method to print out the person's information and hobbies
  def print_info
    puts "Name: #{@name}"
    puts "Age: #{@age}"
    puts "Hobbies: #{@hobbies}"
  end
end

# Define a class called Student which inherits from Person class
class Student < Person
  # Initialize method that takes in name, age, and major parameters
  def initialize(name, age, major)
    # Call the parent's initialize method with name and age parameters
    super(name, age)
    # Set the major attribute to the major parameter
    @major = major
  end
end

# Create a new instance of Student with name, age, and major values
student = Student.new("John", 21, "Computer Science")
# Use the add_hobby method to add a new hobby to the student's hobbies
student.add_hobby("Reading")
# Print out the student's information and hobbies
student.print_info

# Output:
# Name: John
# Age: 21
# Hobbies: ["Reading"]
