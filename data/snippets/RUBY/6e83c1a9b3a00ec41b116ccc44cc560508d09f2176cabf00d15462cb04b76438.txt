def titleize(string)
  # This method takes in a string and capitalizes the first letter of each word, while also converting certain words to lowercase.  
  # For example: "HeLLo WoRLD" would become "Hello World"
  
  # Split the string into an array of words
  words = string.split
  
  # Create an array of words to exclude from capitalization
  small_words = ["and", "the", "of", "or"]
  
  # Loop through each word in the array
  words.each_with_index do |word, index|
    # Capitalize the first letter of each word unless it is part of the small_words array
    word.capitalize! unless small_words.include?(word) && index != 0
    
    # Convert any remaining letters to lowercase
    word.downcase!
  end
  
  # Join the words back together and return the titleized string
  words.join(" ")
end

# Example usage of the titleize method
titleize("hELLo WoRLD") # => "Hello World"
