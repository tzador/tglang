# This code snippet takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of the squares of all even numbers in the array.

# Define a method that takes in an array of numbers
def sum_of_even_squares(array)
  # Initialize a variable to hold the sum
  sum = 0

  # Use Ruby's .each method to iterate through each number in the array
  array.each do |num|
    # Check if the current number is even
    if num % 2 == 0
      # Square the even number and add it to the sum variable
      sum += num**2
    end
  end

  # Return the final sum
  return sum
end

# Example input array
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Call the method and store the result in a variable
result = sum_of_even_squares(numbers)

# Output the result
puts result # Output: 20
