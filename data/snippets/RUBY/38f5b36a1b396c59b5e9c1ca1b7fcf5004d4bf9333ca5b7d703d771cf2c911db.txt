# Example usage:
# Initialize a calculator object with the values 5 and 2
calculator = Calculator.new(5, 2)
# Print the sum
puts "Sum of 5 and 2: #{calculator.sum}"
# Print the difference
puts "Difference between 5 and 2: #{calculator.difference}"
# Print the product
puts "Product of 5 and 2: #{calculator.product}"
# Print the quotient
puts "Quotient of 5 and 2: #{calculator.quotient}"
# Attempt to divide by 0
puts "Trying to divide by 0..."
# Initialize a new calculator object with the values 5 and 0
calculator = Calculator.new(5, 0)
# Should print an error message
puts "Error: #{calculator.quotient}"

# Output:
# Calculator initialized
# Sum of 5 and 2: 7.0
# Difference between 5 and 2: 3.0
# Product of 5 and 2: 10.0
# Quotient of 5 and 2: 2.5
# Trying to divide by 0...
# Cannot divide by 0
