# This code snippet is a class named "Person" that has four attributes and two methods.
class Person
  # This attribute "name" is a string that stores the person's name.
  attr_accessor :name
  # This attribute "age" is an integer that stores the person's age
  attr_accessor :age
  # This attribute "height" is a float that stores the person's height in meters
  attr_accessor :height
  # This attribute "weight" is a float that stores the person's weight in kilograms
  attr_accessor :weight

  # This method "initialize" takes in the person's name, age, height, and weight as parameters and assigns them to the corresponding attributes.
  def initialize(name, age, height, weight)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @height = height
    @weight = weight
  end

  # This method "calculate_bmi" calculates and returns the person's body mass index (BMI) using their height and weight.
  def calculate_bmi
    bmi = weight / (height**2)
    return bmi
  end
end

# Example usage:
# Create a new Person object with the name "John Doe", age 30, height 1.8m, and weight 75kg
person = Person.new("John Doe", 30, 1.8, 75)

# Print the person's name, age, and BMI
puts "Name: #{person.name}"
puts "Age: #{person.age}"
puts "BMI: #{person.calculate_bmi}"
