# This code snippet generates a hash of arrays, with each array representing a list of fruits.

fruits = {                    # create hash called fruits
  "toppings" => ["mango", "pineapple", "kiwi"],    # add key "toppings" with array of fruits as value
  "berries" => ["blueberry", "strawberry", "raspberry"],   # add key "berries" with array of fruits as value
  "tropical" => ["banana", "papaya", "passionfruit"]    # add key "tropical" with array of fruits as value
}

fruits.each do |category, list|  # iterate through each key-value pair in fruits hash
  puts "Here are the #{category} fruits:"   # print string with category name interpolation
  list.each do |fruit|    # iterate through each fruit in the current category's array
    puts "* #{fruit}"     # print string with fruit name interpolation, preceded by asterisk for bullet point
  end
end

# Output:
# Here are the toppings fruits:
# * mango
# * pineapple
# * kiwi
# Here are the berries fruits:
# * blueberry
# * strawberry
# * raspberry
# Here are the tropical fruits:
