# A method to calculate the factorial of a given number
# Inputs:
# - num: integer
# Output:
# - factorial: integer

def factorial(num)
  factorial = 1  # initialize factorial variable to 1
  (1..num).each do |n|  # loop through numbers from 1 to given number
    factorial *= n  # multiply factorial by each number in the loop
  end
  return factorial
end

# Example:
puts factorial(5)  # Output: 120 (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120)
