# This code snippet calculates a user's BMI (Body Mass Index) and categorizes it into different health ranges.

# Define a method to calculate BMI
def calculate_bmi(height, weight)
  return weight / (height ** 2)
end

# Get user's height in meters
puts "Enter your height in meters:"
height_in_meters = gets.chomp

# Get user's weight in kilograms
puts "Enter your weight in kilograms:"
weight_in_kg = gets.chomp

# Convert user's height and weight inputs to numbers
height = height_in_meters.to_f
weight = weight_in_kg.to_f

# Calculate BMI using the method and round it to 2 decimal places
bmi = calculate_bmi(height, weight).round(2)

# Print user's BMI
puts "Your BMI is #{bmi}."

# Categorize user's BMI based on health ranges
