# This is a function that checks if a given number is prime
# and returns true if it is, otherwise returns false
def check_prime(number)
  # a number is prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself
  # this function iterates through numbers from 2 to the given number
  # and checks if any of them is a factor of the given number
  for i in 2..number-1
    # if a number from 2 to the given number is a factor,
    # then the given number is not prime
    if number % i == 0
      # return false as the given number is not prime
      return false
    end
  end
  # if the for loop completes and no number is a factor,
  # then the given number is prime
  # return true as the given number is prime
  return true
end

# example call to the function with a prime number
check_prime(13) #=> true

# example call to the function with a non-prime number
check_prime(15) #=> false
