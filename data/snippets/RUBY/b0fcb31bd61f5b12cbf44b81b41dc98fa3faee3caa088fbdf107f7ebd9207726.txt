# This code snippet is a simple example of a recursive function in Ruby.
# The function calculates the factorial of a given number.
# It takes one argument, the number whose factorial needs to be calculated.
# If the number is 0, the function returns 1.
# If the number is negative, the function prints an error message and exits.
# If the number is positive, the function recursively calls itself with a smaller number until it reaches 0.
# It then multiplies the result by the original number and returns it.

def factorial(num)
  if num == 0
    return 1
  elsif num < 0
    puts "Error: Number cannot be negative."
    exit
  else
    return num * factorial(num - 1)
  end
end

# Example function call and output:
puts factorial(5)
# Output: 120
