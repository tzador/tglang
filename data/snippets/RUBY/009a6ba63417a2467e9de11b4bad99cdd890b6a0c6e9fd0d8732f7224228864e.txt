# This code snippet demonstrates the use of classes and inheritance in Ruby

# Define a parent class called Animal
class Animal
    attr_accessor :name, :age

    # Define a constructor method
    def initialize(name, age)
        @name = name
        @age = age
    end

    # Define a method to get the animal's details
    def get_details
        puts "Name: #{self.name}, Age: #{self.age}"
    end
end

# Define a child class called Dog that inherits from Animal
class Dog < Animal
    attr_accessor :breed

    # Define a constructor method
    def initialize(name, age, breed)
        super(name, age)
        @breed = breed
    end

    # Define a method to get the dog's breed
    def get_breed
        puts "Breed: #{self.breed}"
    end
end

# Create an instance of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog.new("Max", 5, "Golden Retriever")

# Call the get_details method from the parent class
my_dog.get_details

# Call the get_breed method from the child class
my_dog.get_breed

# Output:
# Name: Max, Age: 5
# Breed: Golden Retriever
