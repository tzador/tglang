# This code snippet takes in a string as input
# and returns the number of words in the string.
# Each word is separated by a single space.

  # Initialize a count variable to keep track of the number of words
  count = 0
  
  # Loop through each word in the array and increment the count by 1 for each word
  words.each do |word|

  end
  
  # Return the final count
  return count

# Example input
input_string = "This is a long and complex string"

# Call the word_count method and store the result in a variable
result = word_count(input_string)

# Print the result
