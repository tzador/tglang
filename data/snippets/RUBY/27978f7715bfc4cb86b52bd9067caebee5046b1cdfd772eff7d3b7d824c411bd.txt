# This is a sample Ruby code snippet
 
# Define a class named Student with attributes :name, :age, and :major
class Student 
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :major 

  # Define a method to initialize a Student object with the given attributes 
  def initialize(name, age, major) 
    @name = name
    @age = age 
    @major = major
  end

  # Define a method to print the student's name
  def print_name 
    puts "Student's name is #{@name}"
  end

  # Define a method to check if the student is under 18 years old
  def under_18?
    if @age < 18 
      return true 
    else 
      return false 
    end
  end

  # Define a method to change the student's major
  def change_major(new_major) 
    @major = new_major
    puts "Student's major has been changed to #{@major}"
  end 
end

# Create a new instance of the Student class with given attributes
student1 = Student.new("John", 19, "Biology") 

# Print the student's name using the print_name method
student1.print_name 

# Check if the student is under 18 using the under_18? method and print the result
puts "Is the student under 18? #{student1.under_18?}" 

# Change the student's major using the change_major method 
student1.change_major("Computer Science") 

# Print the student's new major using the accessor method
puts "Student's major is now #{student1.major}"
