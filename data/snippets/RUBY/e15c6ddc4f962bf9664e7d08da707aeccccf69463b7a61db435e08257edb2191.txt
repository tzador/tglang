# This code snippet creates a class called "Person" and defines two methods within it, "initialize" and "introduce".
# The "initialize" method takes in two parameters, "name" and "age", and assigns them to instance variables.
# The "introduce" method prints out a string using the instance variables set in "initialize".
class Person
  # Create an instance variable "name" and assign the "name" parameter to it.
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  # Create an instance variable "age" and assign the "age" parameter to it.
  def initialize(age)
    @age = age
  end

  # Prints out a string using the instance variables "name" and "age".
  def introduce
    puts "Hi, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create a new instance of the "Person" class, passing in the name and age as arguments.
person = Person.new("John", 30)

# Call the "introduce" method on the "person" instance.
person.introduce
