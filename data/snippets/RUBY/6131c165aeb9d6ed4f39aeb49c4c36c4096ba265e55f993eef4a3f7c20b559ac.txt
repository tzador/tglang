# This program calculates the factorial of a given number

# Define a method that takes in a number as a parameter
def factorial(number)

    # Initialize a variable to store the product of all numbers
    product = 1

    # Loop through each number starting from 1 up to the given number
    for i in 1..number

        # Multiply the current number with the product
        product *= i

    end

    # Return the product
    return product

end

# Get a number from the user
puts "Enter a number: "

# Convert the user input to an integer and store it in a variable
num = gets.chomp.to_i

# Call the factorial method and pass in the user input as an argument
result = factorial(num)

# Print the result
puts "The factorial of #{num} is #{result}"
