# This code snippet creates a method called "find_max" that takes in an array as an argument
# and returns the maximum value in the array

def find_max(array)
  # Use the built-in "max" method to find the maximum value in the array
  max = array.max
  # Loop through each element in the array and compare it to the maximum value
  array.each do |num|
    # If the current element is greater than the maximum value, set it as the new maximum value
    if num > max
      max = num
    end
  end
  # Return the maximum value
  return max 
end

# Sample array for testing
my_array = [5, 2, 8, 3, 9, 4, 1]
# Call the "find_max" method and pass in the sample array as an argument
puts find_max(my_array) #=> 9
