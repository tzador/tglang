# Define a method that takes in an array of numbers as an argument
def find_odd_numbers(array)
  # Create an empty array to store odd numbers

  # Loop through each element in the given array
  array.each do |num|
    # Check if the number is odd
    if num % 2 == 1
      # If it is, push it into the odd_numbers array
