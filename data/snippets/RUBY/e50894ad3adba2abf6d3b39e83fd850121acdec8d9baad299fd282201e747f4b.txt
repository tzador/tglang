# This is a complex code snippet in RUBY that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion

  if num == 0 || num == 1

  else
    # recursive call to the factorial function, decreasing the input by 1 each time
    return num * factorial(num - 1)

puts "Enter a number to calculate its factorial:"
input = gets.chomp.to_i

# printing the result of the factorial function
puts "The factorial of #{input} is #{factorial(input)}."
