# This is a complex code snippet in Ruby

# Define a class called Animal
class Animal
  # Add a setter method for the name attribute
  attr_writer :name

  # Add a getter method for the name attribute
  attr_reader :name

  # Initialize the Animal object with a name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  # Define a method to greet the Animal
  def greet
    puts "Hello, I am #{@name}!"
  end
end

# Create an instance of Animal called 'dog'
dog = Animal.new("Fido")

# Call the greet method on the dog instance
dog.greet

# Output: `Hello, I am Fido!`
