# This code snippet is a nested loop that prints out the multiplication table of numbers 1 to 10
# Using nested loops

# Define the number of rows and columns
r = 10
c = 10

# Outer loop for rows
for i in 1..r
  # Inner loop for columns
  for j in 1..c
    # Multiply the current row and column numbers
    result = i * j
    # Print the result with proper formatting
    print "%5s" % result # %5s means to print a string with a total length of 5 characters, right-justified
  end
  # Move to the next row
  print "\n"
end
