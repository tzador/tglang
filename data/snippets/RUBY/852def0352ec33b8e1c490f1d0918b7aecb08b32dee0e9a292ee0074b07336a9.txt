# This code snippet uses the 'each' method to iterate through an array,
# checking for even numbers and printing the sum of the even numbers

# Create an array of random numbers
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Initialize a variable to store the sum of the even numbers
sum = 0

# Use the 'each' method to iterate through the array
array.each do |num|

  # Check if the number is even
  if num % 2 == 0
  
    # Add the even number to the sum
    sum += num
  end
end

# Print out the final sum of the even numbers
p sum
