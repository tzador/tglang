## Method to perform a binary search on a sorted array of integers
## Arguments: array (sorted array of integers), target (integer to search for)
def binary_search(array, target)
    low = 0                 # set the starting index of the array
    high = array.length - 1 # set the ending index of the array
    while low <= high       # iterate as long as the starting index is less than or equal to the ending index
        mid = (low + high) / 2  # calculate the middle index of the array
        if array[mid] == target # if the middle index value is equal to the target, return the index
            return mid
        elsif array[mid] < target # if the middle index value is less than the target, increase the starting index by one
            low = mid + 1
        else                    # if the middle index value is greater than the target, decrease the ending index by one
            high = mid - 1
        end
    end
    return -1   # if the target is not found, return -1
end

# Example usage:
test_array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
target = 7
puts binary_search(test_array, target)

# Output: 3 (the index of the target 7 in the array)
