# This is a complex code snippet in Ruby
class Person # creates a class called Person
  attr_reader :name, :age # creates attributes name and age, only read access
  def initialize(name, age) # initializes the class with name and age arguments
    @name = name # sets the instance variable name to the name argument
    @age = age # sets the instance variable age to the age argument
  end

  def greet # defines a greet method
    puts "Hello there, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old!" # prints a greeting with the person's name and age
  end

  def celebrate_birthday # defines a celebrate_birthday method
    @age += 1 # increments the age by 1
    puts "Happy birthday to me, I am now #{@age} years old!" # prints a birthday message with the person's new age
  end
end

person1 = Person.new("John", 30) # creates a new instance of Person with name "John" and age 30
person1.greet # calls the greet method on person1 and prints the greeting
person1.celebrate_birthday # calls the celebrate_birthday method on person1 and prints the birthday message
