# This is a function that calculates the area of a triangle
# Input:
# - base: the base of the triangle
# - height: the height of the triangle
# Output:
# - area: the calculated area of the triangle
def calculate_area(base, height)
  area = 0.5 * base * height # calculate area using base and height
  return area # return the calculated area
end

# Example usage:
puts calculate_area(10, 5) # output: 25
puts calculate_area(7.2, 3.8) # output: 13.68
