# This is a Ruby code snippet that creates a class and defines multiple methods and variables.

  # The initialize method is used to create new instances of the class.
  def initialize(name, age, height)

  # This method returns the person's age doubled.

  # This method checks if the person is taller than a given height.

# Creating a new Person instance with name, age, and height as arguments.

# Calling the name method to return the person's name.
puts person.name # Output: John

# Setting a new age for the person using the age= method.
person.age = 30

# Calling the double_age method to return the person's age doubled.
puts person.double_age # Output: 60

# Checking if the person is taller than 170.
puts person.is_taller_than?(170) # Output: true

# Checking if the person is an adult.
puts person.is_adult? # Output: true
