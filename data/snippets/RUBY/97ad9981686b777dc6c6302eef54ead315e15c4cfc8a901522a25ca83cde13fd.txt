# This code snippet creates a hash with nested arrays as values
classroom = {
  desks: [5, 6, 7],
  chairs: [10, 11, 12],
  supplies: [ "pencils", "pens", "notebooks"]
}

# Accessing the first value in the "desks" array
classroom[:desks][0]

# Adding another nested array to the hash
classroom[:students] = ["John", "Sara", "David"]

# Iterating through the hash and printing out the keys and values
classroom.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key}: #{value}"
end

# Output:
# desks: [5, 6, 7]
# chairs: [10, 11, 12]
# supplies: ["pencils", "pens", "notebooks"]
# students: ["John", "Sara", "David"]
