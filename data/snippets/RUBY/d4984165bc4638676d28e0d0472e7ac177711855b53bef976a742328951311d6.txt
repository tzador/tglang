# This is a complex code snippet in RUBY which performs a factorial calculation

# Define a method to perform factorial calculation
def factorial(n)
  # If input is 0 or 1, return 1
  return 1 if n == 0 || n == 1

  # Initialize a variable to store the result
  result = 1
  # Use a loop to perform multiplication from n down to 1
  (2..n).each do |i|
    result *= i
  end
  # Return the result
  result
end

# Call the method with input of 6 and store the output in variable 'answer'
answer = factorial(6)

# Print the output with a string for better visualization
puts "The factorial of 6 is #{answer}"
