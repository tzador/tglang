# This is a complex and long code snippet in Ruby

# Define a class for a car
class Car
  attr_accessor :color, :make, :model  # create setter and getter methods for color, make, and model

  # Define a method to initialize a car object
  def initialize(color, make, model)
    @color = color    # set instance variable for color
    @make = make      # set instance variable for make
    @model = model    # set instance variable for model
  end

  # Define a method to start the car
  def start
    puts "The #{color} #{make} #{model} has been started."
  end

  # Define a method to drive the car
  def drive
    puts "The #{color} #{make} #{model} is now in motion."
  end

  # Define a method to stop the car
  def stop
    puts "The #{color} #{make} #{model} has come to a stop."
  end
end

# Create a new car object
my_car = Car.new("red", "Ford", "Mustang")

# Call the methods on the car object
my_car.start
my_car.drive
my_car.stop

# Output:
