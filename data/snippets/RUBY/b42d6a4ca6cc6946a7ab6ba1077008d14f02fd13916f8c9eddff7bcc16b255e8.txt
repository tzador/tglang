# This is a complex Ruby code snippet that generates a sorted array of all the even numbers from 1 to 100

# Initialize an empty array to store the even numbers
even_numbers = []

# Loop through numbers from 1 to 100
(1..100).each do |num|
  # Check if the number is even using the modulus operator
  if num % 2 == 0
    # If the number is even, add it to the even_numbers array
    even_numbers << num
  end
end

# Sort the even_numbers array in ascending order
even_numbers.sort!

# Print the sorted array
puts even_numbers
