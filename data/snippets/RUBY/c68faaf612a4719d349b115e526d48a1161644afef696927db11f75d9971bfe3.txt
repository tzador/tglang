### This code uses a nested loop and conditional statements to generate a multiplication table
# Define the range of numbers to be included in the table
(1..10).each do |row_num|
  (1..10).each do |col_num|
    # Multiply the row and column numbers to get the value
    val = row_num * col_num
    # Check if value is less than 10, to ensure proper spacing
    if val < 10
      print "  "
    else
      print " "
    end
    # Print the value
    print val
  end
  # Move to the next line after each row is completed
  puts
end
