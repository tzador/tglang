# This is a sample code snippet in Ruby
# It demonstrates the use of a complex loop with conditional statements

# Define an array with some integer values
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Define a variable to keep track of the sum
sum = 0

# Loop through the array elements using the "each" method
numbers.each do |num|
  if num % 2 == 0  # Check if the number is even
    sum += num     # Add the number to the sum if it is even
  else
    sum -= num     # Subtract the number from the sum if it is odd
  end
end

# Print the final sum to the console
puts "The final sum is: #{sum}"
