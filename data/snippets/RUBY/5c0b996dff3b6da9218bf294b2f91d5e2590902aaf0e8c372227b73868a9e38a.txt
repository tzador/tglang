# This is a code snippet that uses the 'each' method to iterate over an array of numbers,
# squares each number, and then prints out the result in reverse order.
# The code also uses a 'if' statement to filter out numbers that are not divisible by 3.
# Lastly, the code uses the 'map' method to create a new array with the squared numbers.

# Define an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Create a new empty array
squared_numbers = []

# Use the 'each' method to iterate over the numbers array
numbers.each do |num|

  # Use an 'if' statement to check if the number is divisible by 3
  if num % 3 == 0

    # Square the number using the '**' operator and add it to the squared_numbers array
    squared_numbers << num ** 2
  end
end

# Use the 'map' method to create a new array with the squared numbers stored in reverse order
reversed_numbers = squared_numbers.map { |num| num }.reverse

# Print out the reversed numbers
puts reversed_numbers
