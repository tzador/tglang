#This code snippet uses recursion to find the factorial of a given number
def factorial(n)
  #Base case - If number is 0, factorial is 1
  if n == 0 
    return 1
  end

  #Recursive step - Calls the factorial function with n-1 and multiplies it with n
  return n * factorial(n-1)
end

#Driver code
num = 6
puts "Factorial of #{num} is #{factorial(num)}"

# Output: Factorial of 6 is 720
