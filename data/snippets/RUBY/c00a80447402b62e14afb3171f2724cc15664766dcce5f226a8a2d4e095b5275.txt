def fibonacci(n)
 # Function to generate nth term of the fibonacci sequence
 # Takes in an integer n as input and returns the nth term in the sequence
 # Uses recursion to calculate the value
 
 if n <= 1
   return n # base case for n = 0 or 1
 else
   return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) # recursively calculates the nth term by adding the previous two terms
 end
end
 
puts fibonacci(10) # output: 55
 
# Output explanation: The code snippet generates the 10th term of the fibonacci sequence, which is 55, and prints it as output using the puts function.
