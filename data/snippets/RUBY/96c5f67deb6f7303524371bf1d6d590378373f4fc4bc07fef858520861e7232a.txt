# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion in Ruby

# Define a method that takes in a number as an argument
def factorial(n)
  # Check for base case: if number is 0 or 1, return 1
  if n == 0 || n == 1
    # Use explicit return keyword to return value
    return 1
  # If number is greater than 1, recursively call the factorial method with n-1 and multiply by n
  else
    # Multiply the return value of the recursive method call by n
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
  end
end

# Use puts method to print the result of the factorial method with argument 5
puts "Factorial of 5 is #{factorial(5)}" # Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
