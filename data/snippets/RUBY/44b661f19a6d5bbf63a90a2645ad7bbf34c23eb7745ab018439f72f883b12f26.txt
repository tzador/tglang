#This code snippet generates a random DNA sequence of 10 nucleotides
#using Ruby's sample method
#and then counts the number of each nucleotide present in the sequence

#Create an array with the four nucleotides
nucleotides = ["A", "T", "C", "G"]

#Generate a random DNA sequence of 10 nucleotides by sampling from the nucleotides array
sequence = nucleotides.sample(10)

#Print the generated sequence
puts "Generated sequence: #{sequence}"

#Count the number of each nucleotide present in the sequence
#Create a hash to store the count of each nucleotide
count = {}

#Loop through the sequence and use the count method to count the occurrences of each nucleotide
sequence.each do |nucleotide|
  count[nucleotide] = sequence.count(nucleotide)
end

#Print the count of each nucleotide
puts "Count of each nucleotide:"
count.each do |nucleotide, occurences|
  puts "#{nucleotide}: #{occurences}"
