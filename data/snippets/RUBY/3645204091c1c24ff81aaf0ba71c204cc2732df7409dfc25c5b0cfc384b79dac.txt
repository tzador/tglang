# This is a program to calculate the sum of odd numbers up to a given number

# Define a function that takes in a number
def sum_of_odd_numbers(num)
  # Initialize a variable to store the sum and set it to 0
  sum = 0
  # Loop through numbers from 1 to the input number
  (1..num).each do |i|
    # Check if the number is odd
    if i.odd?
      # Add the number to the sum variable
      sum += i
    end
  end
  # Return the sum
  return sum
end

# Get input from user
puts "Enter a number: "
number = gets.chomp.to_i

# Call the function and assign the result to a variable
result = sum_of_odd_numbers(number)

# Print the result
puts "The sum of odd numbers up to #{number} is #{result}"
