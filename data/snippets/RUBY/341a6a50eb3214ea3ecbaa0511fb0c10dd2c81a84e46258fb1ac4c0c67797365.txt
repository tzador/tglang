# This code snippet finds the average of an array of integers

def find_average(array)
  sum = 0 # initialize a variable to store the sum of all integers in the array
  array.each do |num|
    sum += num # add each integer in the array to the sum variable
  end
  avg = sum / array.length.to_f # calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
  puts "The average of the array is #{avg}" # display the average to the user
end

# create an array of integers
array = [5, 7, 10, 3, 2]
# call the find_average method with the array as an argument
find_average(array)

# Output: The average of the array is 5.4
