# This code snippet uses a nested if statement to check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
# If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".
# If the number is only divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz".
# If the number is only divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz".

num = 15

if num % 3 == 0 # checks if num is divisible by 3
  if num % 5 == 0 # checks if num is also divisible by 5
    puts "FizzBuzz" # prints FizzBuzz if divisible by both 3 and 5
  else
    puts "Fizz" # prints Fizz if only divisible by 3
  end
elsif num % 5 == 0 # checks if num is only divisible by 5
  puts "Buzz" # prints Buzz if only divisible by 5
end
