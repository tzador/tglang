# Implementation of Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers
def gcd(a, b)
    # Loop through values until one is found that divides both numbers
    while b != 0
        # Store current value of b as temporary
        temp = b
        # Set b equal to remainder of a divided by b
        b = a % b
        # Set a equal to temporary value
        a = temp
    end
    # Return the greatest common divisor
    return a

num1 = 36
num2 = 24
# Print the result
puts "Greatest common divisor of #{num1} and #{num2} is #{gcd(num1, num2)}"
