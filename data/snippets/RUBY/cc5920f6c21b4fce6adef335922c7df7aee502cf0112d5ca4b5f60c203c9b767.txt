# This is a code snippet in Ruby that creates a car class and implements various methods for the car object.

# Defining the Car class
class Car
  # Initializing the car object with a make, model, and year
  def initialize(make, model, year)
    @make = make
    @model = model
    @year = year
  end
  
  # Setter method for changing the make of the car
  def set_make(new_make)
    @make = new_make
  end
  
  # Getter method for retrieving the make of the car
  def get_make
    @make
  end
  
  # Method for starting the car's engine
  def start_engine
    puts "The #{@make} #{@model} has started its engine!"
  end
  
  # Method for turning the car's headlights on
  def turn_on_lights
    puts "The headlights on the #{@make} #{@model} have been turned on!"
  end
  
  # Method for calculating the age of the car
  def calculate_age
    current_year = Time.now.year
    age = current_year - @year
    puts "The #{@make} #{@model} is #{age} years old."
  end
end

# Creating a new instance of the Car class
my_car = Car.new("Toyota", "Camry", 2015)

# Changing the make of the car
my_car.set_make("Ford")

# Retrieving the make of the car
my_car.get_make #=> "Ford"

# Starting the car's engine
my_car.start_engine #=> "The Ford Camry has started its engine!"

# Turning the headlights on
my_car.turn_on_lights #=> "The headlights on the Ford Camry have been turned on!"

# Calculating the age of the car
my_car.calculate_age #=> "The Ford Camry is 6 years old."
