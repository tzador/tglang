# This code snippet creates a class called 'Animal'
# with two attributes, 'name' and 'age'
#
# Then, it defines a method called 'introduce' that
# will print out a formatted string using the
# attribute values
# 
# Finally, it creates an instance of the 'Animal'
# class and calls the 'introduce' method to print out
# the animal's name and age in a sentence
class Animal
  attr_accessor :name, :age # defines 'name' and 'age' attributes
  
  def initialize(name, age) # constructor method
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def introduce # defines 'introduce' method
    puts "Hello! My name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

animal = Animal.new("Leo", 5) # creates instance of 'Animal' class
animal.introduce # calls 'introduce' method on the 'animal' instance
# Output: Hello! My name is Leo and I am 5 years old.
