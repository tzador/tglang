#This code snippet uses the Ruby programming language to calculate the average of five numbers.
#Define the method for calculating average
def calculate_average(numbers)
    sum = 0 #Initialize sum variable to 0
    numbers.each do |num|
        sum += num #Add each number in the numbers array to the sum
    end
    avg = sum / numbers.length #Divide the sum by the length of the numbers array to get the average
    return avg #Return the calculated average
end

#Define an array of five numbers to be used for testing the method
numbers = [2, 5, 8, 10, 3]

#Call the calculate_average method with the numbers array as the argument and print the result
puts "The average of the numbers #{numbers} is #{calculate_average(numbers)}"
