#Example usage of the Department class:
sales_dept = Department.new('Sales')
#Creates a new instance of the Department class with the name 'Sales'
sales_dept.add_employee({name: 'John', position: 'Sales Manager'})
#Adds a new employee to the sales department with their name and position
sales_dept.add_employee({name: 'Jane', position: 'Sales Associate'})
#Adds a new employee to the sales department with their name and position
sales_dept.list_employees
#Prints out a list of employees in the sales department
sales_dept.find_employees_by_position('Sales Associate')
#Prints out employees in the sales department who have the position of 'Sales Associate'
