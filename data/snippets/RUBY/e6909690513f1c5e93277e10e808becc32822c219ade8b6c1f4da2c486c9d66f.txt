# This is a complex code snippet in Ruby that uses a 'while' loop and multiple conditional statements

# Initialize a variable named 'num' with a value of 1
num = 1

# Use a 'while' loop to go through numbers 1-5 and print out their squares
while num <= 5 do
  # First conditional statement to check if 'num' is an even number
  if num % 2 == 0
    # Nested conditional statement to check if 'num' is divisible by 3
    if num % 3 == 0
      # Print out 'num' and its square if it is both an even number and divisible by 3
      puts "The square of #{num} is #{num**2}."
      # Increment 'num' by 1
      num += 1
      # Use 'next' to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop
      next
    end
    # Print out 'num' and its square if it is only an even number
    puts "The square of #{num} is #{num**2}."
  # Second conditional statement to check if 'num' is an odd number
  elsif num % 2 == 1
    # Nested conditional statement to check if 'num' is divisible by 5
    if num % 5 == 0
      # Print out 'num' and its square if it is both an odd number and divisible by 5
      puts "The square of #{num} is #{num**2}."
      # Increment 'num' by 1
      num += 1
      # Use 'next' to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop
      next
    end
    # Print out 'num' and its square if it is only an odd number
    puts "The square of #{num} is #{num**2}."
  end
  # Increment 'num' by 1
  num += 1
