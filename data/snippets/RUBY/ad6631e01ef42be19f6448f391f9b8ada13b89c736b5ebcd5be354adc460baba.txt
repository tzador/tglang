# This code snippet creates a class called Person with attributes name, age, and occupation
# Assigns the values passed in during initialization to instance variables
# Creates methods to get and set the attributes

class Person
  # declaring attributes for each instance of the class using attr_accessor
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :occupation

  # initialization method, which takes in the values for name, age, and occupation
  def initialize(name, age, occupation)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @occupation = occupation
  end

  # method to get the name attribute
  def get_name
    @name
  end

  # method to set the name attribute
  def set_name(name)
    @name = name
  end

  # method to get the age attribute
  def get_age
    @age
  end

  # method to set the age attribute
  def set_age(age)
    @age = age
  end

  # method to get the occupation attribute
  def get_occupation
    @occupation
  end

  # method to set the occupation attribute
  def set_occupation(occupation)
    @occupation = occupation
  end
end

# creating an instance of the Person class and passing in values for the attributes

# accessing and printing the attributes using the get methods
puts "Name: #{john.get_name}"

# updating the name attribute using the set method
