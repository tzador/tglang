# This code snippet generates a randomized password with a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters

# Define a method called 'generate_password' with a parameter for the length of the password
def generate_password(length)
  # Define an array with all the characters we want to include in the password
  characters = [*('a'..'z'), *('A'..'Z'), *(0..9)].map(&:to_s) + ["!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")", "-", "_", "=", "+"]
  
  # Create an empty string to store the password
  password = ""

  # Iterate through the specified length and add a random character from the 'characters' array to the 'password' string
  length.times do
    password += characters.sample
  end

  # Return the generated password
  return password
end

# Call the 'generate_password' method with a length of 10 and store the result in a variable called 'password'
password = generate_password(10)

# Output the generated password to the terminal
puts "Your new password is: #{password}"
