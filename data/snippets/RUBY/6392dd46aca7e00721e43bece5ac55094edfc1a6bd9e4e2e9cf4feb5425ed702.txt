# This code snippet generates a recursive function in Ruby that calculates the factorial of a given number

def factorial(num)
  # base case, if number is 0 or 1 return 1
  if num == 0 || num == 1
    return 1
  else
    # recursive call to calculate factorial of previous number and multiply by current number
    return factorial(num-1)*num
  end
end

# prompting user to input a number to calculate factorial for
puts "Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "
# converting user input to integer
num = gets.chomp.to_i
# calling the factorial function with given number as argument
fact = factorial(num)
# printing the factorial of given number
puts "The factorial of #{num} is #{fact}"
