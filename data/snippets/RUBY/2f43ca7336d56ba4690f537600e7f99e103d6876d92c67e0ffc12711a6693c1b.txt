# This code snippet generates a random password with a length of 10 characters
# using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

# Initialize a variable to store the characters to choose from for the password
characters = ("a".."z").to_a + ("A".."Z").to_a + ("0".."9").to_a + ["!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "&", "*"]

# Create an empty string to store the password
password = ""

# Loop through 10 times to generate a 10-character password
10.times do 
  # Randomly select a character from the characters variable and add it to the password string
  password += characters.sample
end

# Print the password
puts password
