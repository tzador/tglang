#This code snippet creates a function that takes in an array of strings and counts the frequency of each string in the array.

def count_frequency(array)
  #Initialize an empty hash to store the frequencies.
  frequency_hash = {}

  #Iterate through the array.
  array.each do |string|

    #If string is already a key in the hash, increment the value by 1.
    if frequency_hash[string]
      frequency_hash[string] += 1

    #Otherwise, add the string as a new key in the hash with a value of 1.
    else
      frequency_hash[string] = 1
    end
  end

  #Return the frequency hash.
  return frequency_hash
end

#Example input array.
array = ["hello", "hello", "world", "ruby", "ruby", "hello"]

#Call the count_frequency function on the input array.
frequency = count_frequency(array)

#Print out the frequency hash.
puts frequency
