# This is a complex code snippet in Ruby
# It uses multiple data types, methods, conditionals, and loops

# Creating an array of strings
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Defining a method that takes in a number and returns true if it is even, false if it is odd
def is_even(number)
  if number % 2 == 0
    return true
  else
    return false
  end
end

# Looping through each fruit in the array and checking if the length is even or odd
fruits.each do |fruit|
  if is_even(fruit.length)
    puts "#{fruit} is even in length"
  else
    puts "#{fruit} is odd in length"
  end
end

# Creating a hash with key-value pairs of fruits and their colors
fruit_colors = {"apple" => "red", "banana" => "yellow", "orange" => "orange"}

# Looping through the hash and printing out the fruit and its color
fruit_colors.each do |fruit, color|
  puts "#{fruit} is #{color}"
end

# Defining a method that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers
def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers)
  sum = 0
  numbers.each do |num|
    if is_even(num)
      sum += num
    end
  end
  return sum
end

# Creating an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Printing out the sum of even numbers in the array using the sum_of_even_numbers method
puts "The sum of even numbers in the array is #{sum_of_even_numbers(numbers)}"
