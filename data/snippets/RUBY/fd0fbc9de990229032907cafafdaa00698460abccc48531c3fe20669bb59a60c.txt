### Define a class called Animal
class Animal
    
    # Constructor method takes in two parameters: name and type
    def initialize(name, type)
        @name = name
        @type = type
    end
    
    # Getter method for name attribute
    def name
        @name
    end
    
    # Getter method for type attribute
    def type
        @type
    end
    
    # Setter method for name attribute
    def name=(new_name)
        @name = new_name
    end
    
    # Setter method for type attribute
    def type=(new_type)
        @type = new_type
    end
    
    # Instance method to print out some information about the animal
    def info
        puts "Name: #{@name}"
        puts "Type: #{@type}"
    end
    
    #Class method that returns a randomly generated animal name
    def self.generate_random_name
        names = ["Fluffy", "Max", "Buddy", "Luna", "Smokey", "Coco", "Oreo", "Bailey"]
        return names.sample
    end
end

# Create an instance of the Animal class called "dog" with name "Max" and type "dog"
dog = Animal.new("Max", "dog")
# Call the info method to print out the information about the dog
dog.info
# Change the dog's name to "Buddy" using the setter method
dog.name = "Buddy"
# Call the info method again to see the updated information
dog.info
# Call the class method generate_random_name to get a random name for a new animal 
random_name = Animal.generate_random_name
# Create an instance of the Animal class called "cat" with the random name and type "cat"
cat = Animal.new(random_name, "cat")
# Call the info method to print out the information about the cat
cat.info
