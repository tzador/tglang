# This is a complex example of a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.

def fibonacci(n) # Creates a function that takes in an integer n as its parameter.
  if n <= 1
    return n # If the input is 0 or 1, return the input as the Fibonacci number.
  else
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) # Otherwise, recursively call the function to find the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers.
  end
end

# Example output:
# fibonacci(5) returns 5 because the fifth Fibonacci number is 5.
# fibonacci(8) returns 21 because the eighth Fibonacci number is 21.
