# This is an example of a recursive function in Ruby
# The function calculates the nth Fibonacci number, starting from 0

def fibonacci(n) # function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
  if n == 0 || n == 1 # check if n is the first or second Fibonacci number
    return n # return n as the result
  else
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2) # recursive function calls itself to calculate the previous two numbers and adds them together
  end
end

n = 10 # setting n as the desired Fibonacci number to calculate
result = fibonacci(n) # calling the function with n as the input
puts "The #{n}th Fibonacci number is #{result}" # printing the result

# Output should be:
# The 10th Fibonacci number is 55
