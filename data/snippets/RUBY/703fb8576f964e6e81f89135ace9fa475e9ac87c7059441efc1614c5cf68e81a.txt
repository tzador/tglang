# This is a complex code snippet in Ruby that creates a class called Vehicle.
# The class has instance variables of color, make, and model which are set during initialization.
# It also has a class variable @@all that holds an array of all Vehicle instances.

class Vehicle
  attr_accessor :color, :make, :model # Creates getter and setter methods for instance variables

  @@all = [] # Class variable that holds all Vehicle instances

  def initialize(color, make, model) # Initialization method
    self.color = color # Sets color instance variable to provided value
    self.make = make # Sets make instance variable to provided value
    self.model = model # Sets model instance variable to provided value
    @@all << self # Adds current instance to @@all array
  end

  def self.all # Class method that returns @@all array
    @@all # Returns @@all array
  end

  def drive # Instance method that prints a message stating the vehicle is driving
    puts "#{self.make} #{self.model} is driving!" # Prints interpolated message with make and model instance variables
  end
end

# Example usage:

car = Vehicle.new("red", "Ford", "Mustang") # Creates new instance of Vehicle
truck = Vehicle.new("blue", "Chevrolet", "Silverado") # Creates another instance of Vehicle
puts Vehicle.all.inspect # Calls class method all and prints out the contents of the @@all array
car.drive # Calls instance method drive on car instance
truck.drive # Calls instance method drive on truck instance
