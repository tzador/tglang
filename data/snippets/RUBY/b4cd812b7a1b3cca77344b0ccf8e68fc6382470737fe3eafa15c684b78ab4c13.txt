# This program creates a deck of 52 playing cards and shuffles them.

# Define a class for a playing card

class Card
    # Use the attr_accessor method to create getter and setter methods for the suit and rank of the card
    attr_accessor :suit, :rank

    # Define a constructor to initialize the suit and rank of the card
    def initialize(suit, rank)
        @suit = suit
        @rank = rank
    end

    # Override the to_s method to print out the rank and suit of the card
    def to_s
        "#{@rank} of #{@suit}"
    end
end

# Create an array of possible suits and an array of possible ranks
suits = ["Hearts", "Diamonds", "Spades", "Clubs"]
ranks = ["Ace", 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, "Jack", "Queen", "King"]

# Create an empty array to store the deck of cards
deck = []

# Use a nested loop to create a card for each combination of suit and rank and add it to the deck
suits.each do |suit|
    ranks.each do |rank|
        # Create a new instance of the Card class with the current suit and rank
        card = Card.new(suit, rank)
        # Add the card to the deck array
        deck << card
    end
end

# Define a method to shuffle the deck
def shuffle(deck)
    # Use the .shuffle! method to randomly rearrange the cards in the deck array
    deck.shuffle!
end

# Call the shuffle method on the deck
shuffle(deck)

# Print out the shuffled deck of cards
puts deck
