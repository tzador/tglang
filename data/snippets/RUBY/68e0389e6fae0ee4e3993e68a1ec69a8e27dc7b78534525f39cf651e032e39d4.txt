# This code snippet performs the sum of two complex numbers

# Define a class for complex numbers
class ComplexNumber
  attr_accessor :real, :imaginary

  # Initialize the complex number with real and imaginary parts
  def initialize(real, imaginary)
    @real = real
    @imaginary = imaginary
  end

  # Overloading '+' operator for complex numbers
  def +(other)
    sum_real = @real + other.real
    sum_imaginary = @imaginary + other.imaginary
    ComplexNumber.new(sum_real, sum_imaginary)
  end

  # Create two instances of complex numbers
  num1 = ComplexNumber.new(2, 3)
  num2 = ComplexNumber.new(4, 5)

  # Perform the sum and store the result in a new variable
  sum = num1 + num2

  # Print out the result in the desired format
  puts "#{sum.real} + #{sum.imaginary}i"  # Output: 6 + 8i
