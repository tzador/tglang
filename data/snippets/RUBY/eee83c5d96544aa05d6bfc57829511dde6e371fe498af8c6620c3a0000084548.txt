# A method that calculates the sum of even numbers in a given array
# Params:
# - arr: the array of integers to be processed
# Returns:
# The sum of even numbers in the array

def sum_even_numbers(arr)
  sum = 0
  arr.each do |num|
    if num.even?
      sum += num
    end
  end
  sum
end

# Example input
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Output: 12
sum_even_numbers(arr)

# Explanation: In this code snippet, we define a method called "sum_even_numbers" that takes in an array as input and calculates the sum of all even numbers in the array. We initialize a variable "sum" to keep track of the sum and then iterate through the array using the "each" method. Within the loop, we use the "even?" method to check if the current number is even, and if it is, we add it to the sum. Finally, we return the sum as the output of the method. To test our method, we create an array and assign it to the variable "arr" and then call the method, passing in the array as the argument. The output should be 12, which is the sum of the even numbers from the original array.
