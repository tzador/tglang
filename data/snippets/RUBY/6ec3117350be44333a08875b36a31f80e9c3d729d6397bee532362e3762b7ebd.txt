# This method returns the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(n)
  sequence = [1, 1] # Initialize array with first 2 numbers in sequence
  (n-2).times do # Loop n-2 times to add n-2 more numbers to sequence
    sequence << sequence[-1] + sequence[-2] # Add the previous 2 numbers in sequence to get next number
  end
  return sequence.take(n) # Return only the first n numbers in the sequence
end

# Example usage, where n = 10
fibonacci(10)

# Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
