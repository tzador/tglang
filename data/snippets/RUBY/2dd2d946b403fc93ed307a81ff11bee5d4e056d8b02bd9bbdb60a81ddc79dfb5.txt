#We are defining a method with parameters
def calculate_total(quantity, price)
  total = quantity * price #This is a local variable, only accessible within this method
  return total
end

#We are calling the method and passing in arguments
puts "The total cost is: #{calculate_total(10, 5)}" #This will print "The total cost is: 50"
