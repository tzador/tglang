### Fibonacci sequence calculation

# Define method using dynamic programming to calculate the Fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(n)
  # Create an empty array to store the calculated sequence
  fib_arr = []
  
  # Loop through n number of times to calculate the sequence
  for i in 0..n-1 do
    # If i is less than 2, push i to the array
    if i < 2
      fib_arr.push(i)
    else
      # Otherwise, calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
      next_num = fib_arr[i-1] + fib_arr[i-2]
      # Push the calculated number to the array
      fib_arr.push(next_num)
    end
  end
  
  # Return the last number in the array as the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
  return fib_arr[n-1]
end

# Output the 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence
puts fibonacci(10)
