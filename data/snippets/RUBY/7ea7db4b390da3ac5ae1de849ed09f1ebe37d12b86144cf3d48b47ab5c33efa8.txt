# This is a Ruby code snippet that calculates the sum of all prime numbers between 1 and 100
# using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm

# Initialize an array with all numbers from 1 to 100
numbers = (2..100).to_a 

# Set the first prime number to be 2, since it is the first prime number
prime = 2 

# Loop through all numbers in the array
while prime < Math.sqrt(100)
  # Remove all multiples of the current prime number from the array
  numbers.reject! { |num| num != prime && (num % prime == 0) }
  # Set the next prime number to be the next number in the array
  prime = numbers[numbers.index(prime) + 1]
end

# Print out the final list of prime numbers
puts "The sum of all prime numbers between 1 and 100 is:"
puts numbers.sum # Output: The sum of all prime numbers between 1 and 100 is: 1060
