# This code snippet creates a class called 'Animal'
# and defines several methods for the class to use

class Animal
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :species

  # Constructor method for initializing an instance of the Animal class
  def initialize(name, age, species)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @species = species
  end

  # Method for getting the name of the animal
  def get_name
    @name
  end

  # Method for getting the age of the animal
  def get_age
    @age
  end

  # Method for getting the species of the animal
  def get_species
    @species
  end

  # Method for updating the age of the animal
  def update_age(age)
    @age = age
  end

  # Method for displaying information about the animal
  def info
    puts "#{@name} is a #{@age} year old #{@species}."
  end
end

# Creating an instance of the Animal class
animal = Animal.new("Leo", 3, "lion")

# Calling the 'info' method to display information about the animal
animal.info

# Output: Leo is a 3 year old lion.
