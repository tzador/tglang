# This program calculates the sum of two numbers
# Input: two numbers (a and b)
# Output: the sum of a and b 

# Define a method called "sum" that takes in two parameters
def sum(a, b)
  # Add the two parameters and store the result in a variable
  result = a + b
  # Return the result
  return result
end

# Ask the user to enter two numbers and store them in variables
puts "Enter a number: "
a = gets.chomp.to_i
puts "Enter another number: "
b = gets.chomp.to_i

# Call the "sum" method and pass in the two variables as arguments
sum = sum(a, b)

# Print the output
puts "The sum of #{a} and #{b} is: #{sum}"
