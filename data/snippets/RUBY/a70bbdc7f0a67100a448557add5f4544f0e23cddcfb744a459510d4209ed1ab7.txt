# Defining a class with a constructor method
class Person
    # Constructor method to initialize instance variables
    def initialize(name, age)
        # Instance variables
        @name = name
        @age = age
    end

    # Method to print person's name and age
    def print_info
        puts "Name: #{@name}"
        puts "Age: #{@age}"
    end
end

# Creating an instance of Person class
person = Person.new("John", 32)

# Calling the print_info method
person.print_info

# Output:
# Name: John
# Age: 32
