# Define a class named Person
class Person
  # Create getters for the instance variables
  attr_reader :name, :age, :gender

  # Create a constructor method that accepts name, age, and gender as arguments
  def initialize(name, age, gender)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @gender = gender
  end

  # Create a method to introduce the person
  def introduce
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end

  # Create a method to determine if the person is an adult
  def adult?
    @age >= 18
  end

  # Create a method to change the name of the person
  def change_name(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end

  # Create a method to age the person by a specified number of years
  def age_by(years)
    @age += years
  end
end

# Create a new instance of the Person class
person = Person.new("John", 25, "male")

# Call the introduce method on the person instance
person.introduce # Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.

# Check if the person is an adult using the adult? method
person.adult? # Output: true

# Change the name of the person using the change_name method
person.change_name("Jane") # Output: "Jane"

# Age the person by 5 years using the age_by method
person.age_by(5) # Output: 30
