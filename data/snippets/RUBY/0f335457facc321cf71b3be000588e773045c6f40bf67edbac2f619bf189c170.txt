# This is a complex Ruby code snippet for creating a class and its methods

# Create a class called Car
class Car

  # Initialize method with parameters brand and model
  def initialize(brand, model)
    @brand = brand
    @model = model
  end

  # Method to set the brand of the car
  def set_brand(brand)
    @brand = brand
  end

  # Method to set the model of the car
  def set_model(model)
    @model = model
  end

  # Method to get the brand of the car
  def get_brand
    @brand
  end

  # Method to get the model of the car
  def get_model
    @model
  end

  # Method to print out information about the car
  def print_info
    puts "This car is a #{@brand} #{@model}."
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Car class
my_car = Car.new("Toyota", "Camry")

# Set the brand of the car using the set_brand method
my_car.set_brand("Honda")

# Print out the brand and model of the car using the get_brand and get_model methods
puts "My car is a #{my_car.get_brand} #{my_car.get_model}."

# Print out information about the car using the print_info method
my_car.print_info
