# This code snippet creates a class Animal with three instance variables: name, age, and species
# The constructor method takes in parameters for each instance variable and sets their values
# The class also has three methods: introduce, eat, and sleep

class Animal
  attr_reader :name, :age, :species
  
  # Constructor method
  def initialize(name, age, species)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @species = species
  end

  # Method to introduce the animal by printing its name and species
  def introduce
    puts "Hi! My name is #{@name} and I am a #{@species}."
  end

  # Method to simulate eating by incrementing the age by 1
  def eat
    @age += 1
    puts "#{@name} is now #{@age} years old."
  end

  # Method to simulate sleeping by decrementing the age by 1
  def sleep
    @age -= 1
    puts "#{@name} is now #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create an instance of Animal with name "Charlie", age 2, and species "dog"
animal1 = Animal.new("Charlie", 2, "dog")

# Call the introduce method to introduce the animal
animal1.introduce #=> "Hi! My name is Charlie and I am a dog."

# Call the eat method to simulate the animal eating
animal1.eat #=> "Charlie is now 3 years old."

# Call the sleep method to simulate the animal sleeping
animal1.sleep #=> "Charlie is now 2 years old."
