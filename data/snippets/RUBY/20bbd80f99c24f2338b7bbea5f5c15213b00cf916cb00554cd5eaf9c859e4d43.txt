# This is a simple program in Ruby that calculates the factorial of a given number

# Function to calculate factorial
def factorial(n)
  # Initializing the factorial value, set to 1 since any number multiplied by 1 will give the same number
  factorial = 1 
  
  # Loop to multiply all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)
  for i in 1..n 
    factorial *= i 
  end
  
  # Return the factorial value
  return factorial 
end

# Getting user input for the number to calculate factorial for
puts "Enter a number:"
n = gets.chomp.to_i # converting input to integer

# Printing the calculated factorial to the console
puts "Factorial of #{n} is #{factorial(n)}"

# Output:
# Enter a number:
# 5
# Factorial of 5 is 120
