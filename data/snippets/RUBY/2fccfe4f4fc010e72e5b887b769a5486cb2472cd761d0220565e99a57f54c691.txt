# This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci series up to a given number
# Define a method to calculate the Fibonacci series
def fibonacci(number)
  # Initialize an array to store the series
  series = [0, 1]

  # Use a loop to generate the series
  while series[-1] + series [-2] < number do
    # Store the next number in the series
    series << series[-1] + series[-2]
  end

  # If the given number is not in the series, remove it
  if series[-1] + series[-2] > number
    series.pop()
  end

  # Return the Fibonacci series as an array
  return series
end

# Prompt the user for a number
print "Enter a number: "

# Convert the input to an integer
number = gets.chomp.to_i

# Call the method with the given number and store the returned series
fib_series = fibonacci(number)

# Output the series to the console
puts "The Fibonacci series up to #{number} is: #{fib_series}"
