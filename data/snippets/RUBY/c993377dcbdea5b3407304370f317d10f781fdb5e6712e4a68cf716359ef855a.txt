# This code snippet demonstrates the use of classes in Ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :gender

  # The initialize method is called when a new instance of the class is created
  def initialize(name, age, gender)
    @name = name      # Instance variable with the person's name
    @age = age        # Instance variable with the person's age
    @gender = gender  # Instance variable with the person's gender
  end

  # This method calculates the person's current year of birth
  def birth_year
    Time.now.year - @age
  end

  # This method checks if the person is an adult (age 18 or above)
  def adult?
    @age >= 18
  end
end

# Create a new instance of the Person class, passing in the person's information
person1 = Person.new("John", 25, "male")

# Print out the person's name and birth year using the class methods
puts "#{person1.name} is #{person1.age} years old and was born in #{person1.birth_year}."

# Check if the person is an adult and print the appropriate message
if person1.adult?
  puts "#{person1.name} is an adult."
else
  puts "#{person1.name} is not an adult."
end

# Output:
#
