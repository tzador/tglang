#This code snippet performs a series of calculations using arrays and conditional statements.
#The final output is an array of the results.

#Array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#Array of operators
operators = ["+", "-", "*", "/", "%"]

#Array of results
results = []

#Iterating through numbers array
numbers.each do |num1|
  #Iterating through operators array
  operators.each do |op|
    #Nested iteration through numbers array to perform calculations
    numbers.each do |num2|
      #Conditional statement to skip division by 0
      unless op == "/" && num2 == 0
        #Performing calculation based on operator
        case op
        when "+"
          result = num1 + num2
        when "-"
          result = num1 - num2
        when "*"
          result = num1 * num2
        when "/"
          result = num1 / num2
        when "%"
          result = num1 % num2
