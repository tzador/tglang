# This function takes in an array of strings and returns a hash
# with the strings as keys and the number of occurrences as values
def count_occurrences(array)
  counts = Hash.new(0) # create a new hash with default value of 0
  array.each { |element| counts[element] += 1 } # loop through array and increment value for each key (element)
  return counts # return the hash
end

# Example
array = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "apple", "banana", "pear", "orange"]
count_occurrences(array) # => {"apple"=>2, "orange"=>2, "banana"=>2, "pear"=>1}
