# This is a Ruby code snippet that uses the Enumerable module and the map method to multiply each element in an array by 2 and then prints the results in a formatted string.

# Define an array with some numbers
numbers = [4, 9, 12, 5, 3]

# Use the map method to create a new array with each element multiplied by 2
multiplied_numbers = numbers.map { |num| num * 2 }

# Use the each_with_index method to iterate through the new array and print each element in a formatted string
multiplied_numbers.each_with_index do |num, index|
  puts "Element #{index + 1}: #{num}"
end
