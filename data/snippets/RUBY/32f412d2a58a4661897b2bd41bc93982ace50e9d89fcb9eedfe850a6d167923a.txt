# This is a code snippet written in Ruby
# It calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

# Method that calculates the Fibonacci sequence
# It takes in a maximum value as an argument
# Returns an array of numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to the maximum value

def fibonacci(max)
  sequence = [0, 1] # initialize array with first two numbers in sequence

  # loop through to generate subsequent numbers in sequence
  while sequence[-1] < max  # check if last number in array is less than max
    next_num = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]  # add last two numbers to get next number in sequence
    sequence << next_num  # add next number to sequence array
  end

  return sequence  # return the array of Fibonacci numbers
end

# User input for maximum value
puts "Enter the maximum value for the Fibonacci sequence: "
max = gets.chomp.to_i  # convert user input to integer

# Call the Fibonacci method and store the result in a variable
result = fibonacci(max)

# Output the resulting Fibonacci sequence
puts "Fibonacci sequence up to #{max}: "
puts result.join(", ")  # join array elements into a string separated by a comma


# Output: 
#
