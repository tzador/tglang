# This code snippet creates a method that checks if a given number is prime or not.

# Define a method called 'is_prime' that takes in a single parameter 'num'
def is_prime(num)
  # If the number is 1 or 0, return false, as they are not prime numbers
  return false if num == 1 || num == 0
  # Use the square root of the number as the limit for the loop
  limit = Math.sqrt(num).to_i
  # Loop through numbers from 2 to the limit
  (2..limit).each do |n|
    # If the number is divisible by any number in the loop, return false
    return false if num % n == 0
  end
  # If the loop ends without returning false, the number is prime and we return true
  return true
end

# Call the method with the number 29 and print the output
puts is_prime(29)

# Output: true
