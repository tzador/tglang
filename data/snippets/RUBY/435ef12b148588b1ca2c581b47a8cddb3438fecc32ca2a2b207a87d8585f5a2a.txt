# This code snippet generates a Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
# Replace the value after "n =" with the desired number of terms.
# The output will be an array containing the Fibonacci sequence.

n = 10 # change this value to generate sequence up to desired number of terms

fibonacci = [0, 1] # initial array with first two terms of sequence

# loop through remaining terms and append to array
(n - 2).times do
  fibonacci << (fibonacci[-1] + fibonacci[-2])
end

# print output array
puts fibonacci.to_s # replace "puts" with "print" for output without brackets

# output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
