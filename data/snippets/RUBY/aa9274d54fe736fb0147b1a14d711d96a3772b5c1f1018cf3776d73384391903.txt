# This is a complex code snippet in Ruby.
# It creates a class named Person and defines four instance methods.

class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age # defines getter and setter methods for instance variables

  # initialize method with default values for name and age parameters
  def initialize(name = "John Doe", age = 25)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  # method that prints out the person's name
  def print_name
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name}!"
  end

  # method that calculates and returns the person's birth year
  def birth_year
    # current year
    current_year = Time.now.year
    # subtracting age from current year to get birth year
    birth_year = current_year - @age
    # returning birth year
    return birth_year
  end

  # method that checks if person is an adult (over 18)
  def is_adult?
    if @age > 18
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end
