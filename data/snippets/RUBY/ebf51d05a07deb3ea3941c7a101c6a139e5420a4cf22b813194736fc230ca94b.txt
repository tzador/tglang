# Define a class called 'Car'
class Car
  # Access the 'brand' attribute
  attr_accessor :brand

  # Define a class method 'years_old' that takes in a 'year' parameter
  def self.years_old(year)
    # Calculate the age of the car by subtracting the 'year' parameter from the current year
    Time.now.year - year
  end

# Create an instance of the 'Car' class with the brand 'Ford'
my_car = Car.new

# Call the 'years_old' class method on the 'Car' class and pass in the year 1995
Car.years_old(1995)

# Output: 26 (assuming current year is 2021)
