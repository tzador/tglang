# This code snippet creates a class named Rectangle which takes in two parameters: height and width
class Rectangle
    # This line sets the height and width instance variables
    def initialize(height, width)
        @height = height
        @width = width
    end

    # This method calculates the area of the rectangle
    def get_area
        @area = @height * @width
        puts "The area of the rectangle is #{@area}"
    end
end

# This line creates an instance of the Rectangle class with height = 6 and width = 10
rectangle = Rectangle.new(6, 10)

# This line calls the get_area method on the rectangle instance, which outputs the area of the rectangle
rectangle.get_area

# Output: "The area of the rectangle is 60"
