# This code snippet creates a method called 'calculate_average'
# that takes in an array of numbers as an argument and returns
# the average of all the numbers in the array.

def calculate_average(nums)
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of all the numbers
    sum = 0

    # Loop through each number in the array
    nums.each do |num|
        # Add the number to the sum variable
        sum += num
    end

    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the size of the array
    avg = sum / nums.size

    # Return the average
    return avg
end

# Example usage of the method
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
puts "The average of the numbers is: #{average}"

# Output: The average of the numbers is: 30
