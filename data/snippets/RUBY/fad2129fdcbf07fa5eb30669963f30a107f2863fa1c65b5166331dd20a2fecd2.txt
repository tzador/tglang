# This program calculates the sum of squares of numbers in a given range and outputs the result

# Define a method to calculate sum of squares
def sum_of_squares(range)
  # Initialize a variable to store the sum
  sum = 0
  # Loop through each number in the given range
  range.each do |num|
    # Square each number and add it to the sum
    sum += num ** 2
  end
  # Return the final sum
  sum
end

# Take user input for range
print "Enter the starting number of the range: "
start = gets.chomp.to_i
print "Enter the ending number of the range: "
end_num = gets.chomp.to_i

# Create a range using user input and store it in a variable
range = (start..end_num)

# Call the sum_of_squares method and store the result in a variable
result = sum_of_squares(range)

# Output the result
puts "The sum of squares of numbers from #{start} to #{end_num} is #{result}."
