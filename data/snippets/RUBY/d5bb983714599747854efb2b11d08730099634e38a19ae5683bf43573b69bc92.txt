#This method takes in two integers, x and y, and returns their greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.

def gcd(x, y)
  #first we need to make sure that x is greater than y
  if x < y
    temp = x
    x = y
    y = temp
  end
  #then we continue with the Euclidean algorithm
  while y > 0
    remainder = x % y
    x = y
    y = remainder
  end
  return x
end

#example usage
x = 12
y = 18
puts gcd(x, y)
#output: 6
