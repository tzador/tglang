# This code snippet takes in a hash and returns the sum of its values
def hash_sum(hash)
  # initialize a variable to keep track of the sum
  sum = 0
  # iterate through the hash and add each value to the sum
  hash.each do |key, value|
    sum += value
  end
  # return the sum
  return sum
end

# Example hash for testing
example_hash = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4}

# Call the hash_sum method with the example hash as the argument and print the result
puts hash_sum(example_hash)

# Output: 10
