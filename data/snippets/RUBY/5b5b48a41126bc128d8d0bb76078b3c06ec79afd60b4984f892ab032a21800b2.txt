# This is a complex code snippet that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the sum of their squares.

# Define a method that takes in an array as a parameter
def calculate_sum_of_squares(numbers)
  # Initialize a variable to store the sum
  result = 0
  
  # Loop through each number in the array
  numbers.each do |num|
    # Calculate the square of the current number and add it to the result variable
    result += num * num
  end
  
  # Return the result
  return result
end

# Define an array of numbers
list = [2, 5, 10, 3, 8]

# Call the method and pass in the array as an argument
sum_of_squares = calculate_sum_of_squares(list)

# Print the result
puts "The sum of squares is: #{sum_of_squares}"
 
# Output: The sum of squares is: 198
