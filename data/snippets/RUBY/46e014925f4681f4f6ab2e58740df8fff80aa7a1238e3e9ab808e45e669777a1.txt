# This is a function that takes in an array of strings and outputs the average length of those strings
def average_length(strings_array)

  # Initializing a variable to hold the total length
  total_length = 0

  # Looping through the strings in the array
  strings_array.each do |string|

    # Adding the length of each string to the total length
    total_length += string.length
  end

  # Calculating the average length by dividing the total length by the number of strings
  average = total_length / strings_array.length

  # Returning the average length
  return average
end

# Example usage of the function
strings = ["hello", "world", "code", "snippet"]
output = average_length(strings)
puts output  # Output: 5 (since the average length of the strings in the array is 5)
