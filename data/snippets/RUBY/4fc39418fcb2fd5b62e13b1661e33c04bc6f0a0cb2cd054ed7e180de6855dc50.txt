# This is a complex code snippet in RUBY that creates a class called "Person" with attributes and methods.
# The class has a constructor method that takes in the person's name, age, and occupation as parameters.
class Person
  # Creates getters and setters for name, age, and occupation
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :occupation

  # Constructor method that sets the attributes based on the parameters passed in
  def initialize(name, age, occupation)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @occupation = occupation
  end

  # Method that displays the person's introduction based on their attributes
  def introduce
    puts "Hi, my name is #{@name}, I am #{@age} years old, and I work as a #{@occupation}."
  end

  # Method that determines if the person is old enough to retire based on their age
  def retirement_check
    if @age >= 65
      puts "Congratulations #{@name}, you are old enough to retire!"
    else
      puts "Sorry #{@name}, you still have a few years until retirement."
    end
  end
end

# Creates an instance of the Person class with the given parameters
person1 = Person.new("John", 35, "software developer")

# Calls the introduce method on the person1 instance
person1.introduce

# Calls the retirement_check method on the person1 instance
person1.retirement_check

# Output:
# Hi, my name is John, I am 35 years old, and I work as a software developer.
# Sorry John, you still have a few years until retirement.
