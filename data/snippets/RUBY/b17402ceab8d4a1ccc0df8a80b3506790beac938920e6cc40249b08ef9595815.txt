# This code snippet creates a method that calculates the factorial of a number
# using recursion

def factorial(n)
  # The base case of the recursion is when n equals 0 or 1, the factorial is 1
  # If n is greater than 1, the method recursively calls itself with n-1
  # and multiplies the result by n
  if n == 0 || n == 1
    return 1
  else
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  end
end

# Testing the method with different inputs and printing the output
puts "Factorial of 0 is #{factorial(0)}"
puts "Factorial of 5 is #{factorial(5)}"
puts "Factorial of 10 is #{factorial(10)}"

# Output:
# Factorial of 0 is 1
# Factorial of 5 is 120
# Factorial of 10 is 3628800
