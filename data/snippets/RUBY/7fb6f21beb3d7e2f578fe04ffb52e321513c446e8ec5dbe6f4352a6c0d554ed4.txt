#This code snippet takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list

#declaring a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

#creating a method to find sum of even numbers
def sum_even(numbers)
  #initializing a variable to hold the sum
  sum = 0 
  
  #looping through the list of numbers 
  numbers.each do |num|
    #checking if the number is even 
    if num % 2 == 0 
      #updating the sum with the even number 
      sum += num
    end
  end
  
  #returning the final sum
  return sum
end

#calling the method and storing the result in a variable
even_sum = sum_even(numbers)

#outputting the result 
puts "Sum of all even numbers: #{even_sum}"
