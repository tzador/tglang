# This code snippet defines a class called "Player" with two instance variables, "name" and "score", and four methods.

class Player

  # This method initializes a new instance of the Player class with a name and a starting score of zero.
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @score = 0
  end

  # This method adds points to the player's score.
  def add_points(points)
    @score += points
  end

  # This method subtracts points from the player's score.
  def minus_points(points)
    @score -= points
  end

  # This method prints out the player's current score.
  def print_score
    puts "Player #{@name}'s current score is #{@score}."
  end

end

# Creating a new instance of the Player class with the name "John"
john = Player.new("John")

# Calling the add_points method to add 10 points to John's score
john.add_points(10)

# Calling the minus_points method to subtract 5 points from John's score
john.minus_points(5)

# Calling the print_score method to print John's current score
john.print_score

# Output: Player John's current score is 5.
