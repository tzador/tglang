# This code is a nested loop that iterates through two arrays and prints the multiplication of each element in the arrays.

array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
array2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]

# Loop through the first array

array1.each do |num1|
  
  # Loop through the second array
    
  array2.each do |num2|
    
    # Multiply the elements and print the result
        
    puts "#{num1} * #{num2} = #{num1 * num2}"
