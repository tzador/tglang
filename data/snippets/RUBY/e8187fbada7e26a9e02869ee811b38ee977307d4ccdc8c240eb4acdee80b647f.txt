# This is a comment in Ruby
def fibonacci(n)
  # Defines a method that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number
  if n < 3
    # If n is less than 3, the sequence will just be [0, 1]
    [0, 1]
  else
    # Otherwise, create a new array with the first 2 numbers of the sequence
    sequence = [0, 1]
    # Loop through n-2 times (since the first 2 numbers are already in the sequence)
    (n-2).times do
      # Add the sum of the last 2 numbers in the sequence to the end of the sequence
      sequence.push(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    end
    # Return the complete sequence up to the nth number
    sequence
  end
end

# Call the method and pass in a value for n
fibonacci(10) # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
