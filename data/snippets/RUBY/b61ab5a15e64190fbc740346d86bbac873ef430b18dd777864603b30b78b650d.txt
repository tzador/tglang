# This is a code snippet in RUBY that generates a Fibonacci sequence and finds the sum of all even numbers in the sequence.

# Define a method to generate Fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(n)
  fib_array = [0, 1] # initialize array with first two numbers in sequence
  (n-2).times do # loop for remaining numbers
    fib_array << fib_array[-1] + fib_array[-2] # add last two numbers and append result to array
  end
  fib_array # return the array with the full Fibonacci sequence
end

# Call the method and store the output in a variable
fib_sequence = fibonacci(20)

# Define a method to find the sum of even numbers in a given array
def find_even_sum(array)
  even_sum = 0
  array.each do |num|
    if num.even? # check if number is even
      even_sum += num # if so, add it to the sum variable
    end
  end
  even_sum # return the sum of even numbers
end

# Call the method and store the output in a variable
even_sum = find_even_sum(fib_sequence)

# Print the output
puts "The sum of even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence is #{even_sum}"
