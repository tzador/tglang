# This is a complex code snippet in RUBY that calculates the average of three numbers.

# Define a method that takes in three numbers as parameters
def calculate_average(num1, num2, num3)
  # Add the three numbers together and store the sum in a variable
  sum = num1 + num2 + num3
  # Divide the sum by the total number of numbers (3) and store the result in a variable
  average = sum / 3.0
  # Round the average to two decimal places and store the result in a variable
  rounded_average = average.round(2)
  # Return the rounded average as the output of the method
  return rounded_average
end

# Call the method with three numbers, 3, 9, and 12, and store the result in a variable
result = calculate_average(3, 9, 12)

# Print the result to the console
puts "The average of the three numbers is #{result}."
