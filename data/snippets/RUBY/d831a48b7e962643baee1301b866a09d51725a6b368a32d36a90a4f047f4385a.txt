def determine_avg(arr)
  # This method takes in an array and
  # calculates the average of its elements 
  sum = 0 # initialize sum variable
  arr.each {|element| sum += element} # iterate through array and add each element to sum
  avg = sum.to_f/arr.size # calculate average by dividing sum by size of array
  return avg # return average
end

# Example call:
test_arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
avg = determine_avg(test_arr) # returns 3.0

# This code snippet demonstrates a method that takes in an array and calculates the average of its elements.
# The method first initializes a sum variable and then iterates through the array, adding each element to the sum.
# The average is then calculated by dividing the sum by the size of the array and is returned as a float.
# An example call is shown, with the average from the test array being returned and assigned to a variable.
