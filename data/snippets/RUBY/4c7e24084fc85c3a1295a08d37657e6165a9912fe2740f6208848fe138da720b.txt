# Code to calculate the sum of squares of numbers in an array

# Define an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Define a function to calculate the sum of squares
def sum_of_squares(numbers)
  # Initialize a variable to store the sum
  sum = 0

  # Loop through the array and square each number, then add it to the sum
  numbers.each do |num|
    sum += num ** 2
  end

  # Return the sum
  return sum
end

# Call the function with the numbers array
sum_of_squares(numbers)

# Output should be 55 (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 55)
