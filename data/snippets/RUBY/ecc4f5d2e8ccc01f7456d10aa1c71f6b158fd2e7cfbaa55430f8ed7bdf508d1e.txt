# This code snippet is a program that calculates the area of a triangle

# Define a class called Triangle
class Triangle

  # Define a constructor that takes in 3 sides as parameters
  def initialize(side1, side2, side3)
    # Set instance variables for each side
    @side1 = side1
    @side2 = side2
    @side3 = side3
  end

  # Create a method to calculate the perimeter of the triangle
  def perimeter
    @side1 + @side2 + @side3
  end

  # Create a method to calculate the area of the triangle using the Heron's formula
  def area
    # Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = perimeter / 2.0

    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    Math.sqrt(s * (s - @side1) * (s - @side2) * (s - @side3))
  end

end

# Create an instance of the Triangle class
triangle = Triangle.new(3, 4, 5)

# Print the area of the triangle
puts "The area of the triangle is #{triangle.area}"
