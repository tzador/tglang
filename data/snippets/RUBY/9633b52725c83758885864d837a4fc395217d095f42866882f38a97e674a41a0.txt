# This code snippet creates a Human class with attributes for name, age, and occupation
class Human
    attr_accessor :name, :age, :occupation

    # Constructor method for Human class
    def initialize(name, age, occupation)
        @name = name
        @age = age
        @occupation = occupation
    end

    # Method to print information about the human
    def print_info
        puts "Name: #{@name}"
        puts "Age: #{@age}"
        puts "Occupation: #{@occupation}"
    end
end

# Creating an instance of the Human class
person = Human.new("John", 25, "Software Engineer")

# Calling the print_info method on the person instance
person.print_info

# Output:
# Name: John
