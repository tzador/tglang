def factorial(n) #defining a method with parameter n

    1 #returns 1 if n is less than or equal to 1
  else
    n * factorial(n-1) #recursively calls the factorial method until n equals 1

# Output
puts factorial(5) #calling the factorial method with argument 5 and printing the result

# Output: 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
