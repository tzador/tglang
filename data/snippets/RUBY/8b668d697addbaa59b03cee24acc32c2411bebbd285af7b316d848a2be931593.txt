# This code snippet performs matrix multiplication using the Ruby language

# Define the first matrix as a 2x2 array
matrix1 = [[1,2], [3,4]]

# Define the second matrix as a 2x2 array
matrix2 = [[5,6], [7,8]]

# Define the result matrix as a 2x2 array
result_matrix = [[0,0], [0,0]]

# Calculate the number of rows in the first matrix
rows1 = matrix1.length

# Calculate the number of columns in the second matrix
cols2 = matrix2[0].length

# Calculate the number of rows in the second matrix
rows2 = matrix2.length

# Perform matrix multiplication
for i in 0...rows1
  for j in 0...cols2
    for k in 0...rows2
      result_matrix[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j]
    end
  end
end

# Print the result matrix
puts "Result Matrix:"
p result_matrix

# Output:
# Result Matrix:
# [[19, 22], [43, 50]]
