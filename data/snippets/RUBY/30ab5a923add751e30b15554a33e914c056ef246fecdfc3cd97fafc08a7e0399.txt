# This code snippet shows an example of a method that performs a selection sort on an array
def selection_sort(arr)
  # Loop through the array, with variable i representing the current index
  for i in 0..arr.length-1
    # Set variable min_idx to i, representing the index of the minimum value in the unsorted portion of the array
    min_idx = i
    # Loop through the unsorted portion of the array, with variable j representing the current index
    for j in (i+1)..arr.length-1
      # If the value at index j is less than the value at index min_idx, set min_idx to j
      if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]
        min_idx = j
      end
    end
    # Swap the values at index i and min_idx, effectively sorting the current minimum value to the beginning of the sorted portion of the array
    temp = arr[i]
    arr[i] = arr[min_idx]
    arr[min_idx] = temp
  end
  # Return the sorted array
  return arr
end
