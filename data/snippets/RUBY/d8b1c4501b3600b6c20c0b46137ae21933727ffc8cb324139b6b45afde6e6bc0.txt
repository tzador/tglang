# This code snippet uses a loop and conditionals to check if a number is prime or not

# Define a function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num)
  if num <= 1 # Check if number is less than or equal to 1, which is not a prime number
    return false
  elsif num == 2 # 2 is the only even prime number
    return true
  elsif num % 2 == 0 # Check if number is even, since all even numbers except 2 are not prime
    return false
  else # Use a loop to check if number is divisible by any odd number from 3 to the square root of the number
    i = 3
    while i * i <= num
      if num % i == 0 # If number is evenly divisible, then it is not prime
        return false
      end
      i += 2 # Skip even numbers
    end
    return true # If number is not divisible by any number, then it is prime
  end
end

# Prompt user to enter a number to check if it is prime
print "Enter a number: "
num = gets.chomp.to_i

# Call the is_prime function and print result
if is_prime(num)
  puts "#{num} is a prime number"
else
  puts "#{num} is not a prime number"
