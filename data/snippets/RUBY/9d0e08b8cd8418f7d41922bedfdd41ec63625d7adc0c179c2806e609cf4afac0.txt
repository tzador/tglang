# This code snippet calculates the average of a list of numbers
# Input: List of numbers
# Output: Average of the list

def calculate_average(numbers)
  # Initialize sum to zero
  sum = 0

  # Loop through each number in the list
  numbers.each do |num|
    # Update the sum by adding the current number
    sum += num
  end

  # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list
  average = sum / numbers.length

  # Return the average
  return average
end

# Sample input list
numbers = [12, 32, 45, 17]

# Call the calculate_average function with the input list
average = calculate_average(numbers)

# Print the output
puts "The average of the list is: #{average}"
