# This code snippet generates a factorial function using recursion

# Define a method called factorial that takes in a number
def factorial(num)
  # Base case: if num is 0 or 1, return 1
  if num == 0 || num == 1
    return 1
  # Recursive case: if num is greater than 1, call the factorial method with num-1 and multiply it by num
  else
    return factorial(num-1) * num
  end
end

# Output the factorial of 5 using the factorial method
puts factorial(5)
# Output: 120
