#This code snippet takes in a string and returns a hash containing the counts of each character in the string.
def character_count(string)
    string_hash = Hash.new(0) #creates an empty hash with default value of 0
    string.each_char do |char| #iterates through each character in the string
        string_hash[char] += 1 #increments the count of the character in the hash by 1
    end
    return string_hash #returns the hash with character counts
end

#Example input and output:
puts character_count("Hello World")
# => {"H" => 1, "e" => 1, "l" => 3, "o" => 2, " " => 1, "W" => 1, "r" => 1, "d" => 1}
