#This is a code snippet in Ruby that uses the Enumerable module to sort a list of students by their grades
students = [{name: "John", grade: 92}, {name: "Jane", grade: 87}, {name: "Alex", grade: 95}]

#sort students by grade, from highest to lowest
sorted_students = students.sort_by { |student| -student[:grade] }

#loop through sorted_students and print out each student's name and grade
sorted_students.each do |student|
  puts "#{student[:name]}: #{student[:grade]}"
end

#Output:
#Alex: 95
#John: 92
#Jane: 87
