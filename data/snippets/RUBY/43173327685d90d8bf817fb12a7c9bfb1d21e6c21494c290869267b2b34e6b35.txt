def fibonacci(n)
  # This method calculates the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence.
  # Parameters:
  #   n (Integer): The index of the number to be calculated.
  # Returns:
  #   num (Integer): The n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence.

  # Initialize first two numbers in sequence
  nums = [0, 1]

  # Loop through sequence up to n
  (n - 2).times do
    # Calculate next number in sequence by adding last two numbers
    nums << nums[-1] + nums[-2]
  end

  # Return the n-th number in the sequence
  return nums[-1]
end

# Example usage:
puts fibonacci(10)
# Output: 34
