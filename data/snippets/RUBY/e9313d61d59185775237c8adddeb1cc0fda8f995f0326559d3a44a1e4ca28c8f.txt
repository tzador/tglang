# This block of code is a method with two parameters: a and b 
def calculate(a, b)
    # A variable c is assigned the sum of a and b 
    c = a + b

    # A while loop runs as long as c is less than 100
    while c < 100
        # Each time the loop runs, c is multiplied by c
        c *= c
    end

    # A variable d is assigned the value of c plus 1
    d = c + 1

    # A for loop that iterates from 1 to d
    for i in 1..d
        # Prints the value of i
        puts i
    end

    # Returns the value of d
    return d
end

# Calls the method with arguments 5 and 10 and assigns the return value to variable result
result = calculate(5, 10)

# Prints the value of result
puts result
