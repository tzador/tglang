### Create a class named 'Car'
class Car
  # Initialize method with 'make' and 'model' as parameters
  def initialize(make, model)
    # Set instance variables for 'make' and 'model'
    @make = make
    @model = model
  end
  
  # Getter method for 'make'
  def make
    @make
  end
  
  # Setter method for 'make'
  def make=(new_make)
    @make = new_make
  end
  
  # Getter method for 'model'
  def model
    @model
  end
  
  # Setter method for 'model'
  def model=(new_model)
    @model = new_model
  end
  
  # Method to accelerate
  def accelerate(speed)
    puts "Accelerating to #{speed} mph!"
  end
  
  # Method to stop
  def stop
    puts "Stopping!"
  end
end

### Create an instance of the Car class
my_car = Car.new("Toyota", "Camry")

### Use getter methods to access instance variables
puts "My car's make is #{my_car.make}" # Output: My car's make is Toyota
puts "My car's model is #{my_car.model}" # Output: My car's model is Camry

### Use setter methods to change instance variables
my_car.make = "Honda"
my_car.model = "Accord"

### Call methods on the instance
my_car.accelerate(60) # Output: Accelerating to 60 mph!
my_car.stop # Output: Stopping!
