# This code snippet creates a class named 'Animal' and initializes it with three attributes.
# The class also includes a method that defines the sound the animal makes when called.
# The code snippet then creates an instance of the 'Animal' class and calls the method to output the sound.
class Animal
  attr_reader :name, :color, :sound

  def initialize(name, color, sound)
    @name = name
    @color = color
    @sound = sound
  end

  def make_sound
    puts "#{name} makes a #{sound} sound!"
  end
end

# Create new instance of Animal class
dog = Animal.new("dog", "brown", "woof")

# Call make_sound method on dog instance
dog.make_sound

# Output:
# dog makes a woof sound!
