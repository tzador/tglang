# Example code in Ruby

# Define a class named Person with three attributes: name, age, and occupation.
class Person
  # Define getter and setter methods for name, age, and occupation.
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :occupation

  # Define an initialize method that takes in name, age, and occupation as arguments and sets them as instance variables.
  def initialize(name, age, occupation)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @occupation = occupation
  end

  # Define a method named introduce that outputs a string with the person's name, age, and occupation.
  def introduce
    puts "Hi, my name is #{@name}, I am #{@age} years old and I work as a #{@occupation}."
  end
end

# Create an instance of Person and pass in values for name, age, and occupation.
person = Person.new("John Doe", 35, "Software Developer")

# Call the introduce method on the person instance.
person.introduce
