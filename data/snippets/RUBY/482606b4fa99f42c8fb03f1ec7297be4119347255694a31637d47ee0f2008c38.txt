# Welcome to the world of Ruby!
# This code snippet creates a class called "Person" and defines methods for setting and getting a person's name, age, and occupation.
# The class also has a method for printing out a person's information in a formatted string.
class Person

  # Define initialize method for setting initial instance variables
  def initialize(name, age, occupation)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @occupation = occupation
  end

  # Define setter methods for each instance variable
  def name=(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def age=(age)
    @age = age
  end

  def occupation=(occupation)
    @occupation = occupation
  end

  # Define getter methods for each instance variable
  def name
    @name
  end

  def age
    @age
  end

  def occupation
    @occupation
  end

  # Define method for printing out a person's information
  def print_info
    puts "Name: #{@name}, Age: #{@age}, Occupation: #{@occupation}"
  end

end

# Create new instance of Person class with given parameters
person1 = Person.new("John", 25, "Teacher")

# Set name of person1 using setter method
person1.name = "Jane"

# Call print_info method to output formatted string of person's information
person1.print_info

# Output:
# Name: Jane, Age: 25, Occupation: Teacher
