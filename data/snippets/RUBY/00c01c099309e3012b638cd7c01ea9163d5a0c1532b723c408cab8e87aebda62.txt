# This code snippet creates a class called "Animal" with instance methods "eat" and "sleep"
# It also defines a method "speak" which takes in a string argument and prints it
# Finally, it creates an instance of the class and calls the methods on it

class Animal # Creates a class called "Animal"
  def eat # Defines an instance method "eat"
    puts "The animal is eating"
  end

  def sleep # Defines an instance method "sleep"
    puts "The animal is sleeping"
  end

  def speak(string) # Defines a method "speak" which takes in a string argument
    puts string # Prints the argument passed in
  end
end

animal = Animal.new # Creates a new instance of the "Animal" class
animal.eat # Calls the "eat" method on the instance
# Output: The animal is eating

animal.sleep # Calls the "sleep" method on the instance
# Output: The animal is sleeping

animal.speak("Hello world") # Calls the "speak" method on the instance, passing in the string "Hello world" as an argument
