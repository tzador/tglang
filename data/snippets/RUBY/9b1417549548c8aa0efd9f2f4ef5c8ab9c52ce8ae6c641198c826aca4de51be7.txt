# This code snippet takes in user input and calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to the user input number.
# It then prints out the result.

# Function to calculate the sum of even numbers
def calculate_even_sum(num)
  # Initialize variables
  sum = 0
  current_num = 2

  # Loop through numbers from 1 to user input number
  while current_num <= num do
    # Add even numbers to sum
    sum += current_num
    # Increment current number by 2
    current_num += 2
  end

  # Return sum
  return sum
end

# Get user input
print "Enter a number: "
input_num = gets.chomp.to_i

# Calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to input number
even_sum = calculate_even_sum(input_num)

# Print out result
puts "The sum of even numbers from 1 to #{input_num} is #{even_sum}."

# Output:
#
