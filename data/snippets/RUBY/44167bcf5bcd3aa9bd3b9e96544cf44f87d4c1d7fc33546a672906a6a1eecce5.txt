# This code snippet is a program that generates a random password with a specified length and characters allowed.
# It imports the 'securerandom' module for generating random characters.

# Define method for generating password
def generate_password(length)
  # Set characters to use in password generation
  characters = [('a'..'z'), ('A'..'Z'), ('0'..'9')].map(&:to_a).flatten
  # Generate random characters based on given length
  password = (0...length).map { characters[rand(characters.length)] }.join
  # Output generated password
  puts "Your new password is: #{password}"
end

# Prompt user for desired password length
puts "Please enter desired password length: "
# Get user input and convert to integer
length = gets.chomp.to_i

# Call generate_password method with given length as argument
generate_password(length)
