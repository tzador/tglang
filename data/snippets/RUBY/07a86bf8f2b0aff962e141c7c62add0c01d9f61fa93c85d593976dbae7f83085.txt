# This code snippet uses a custom class called "Fibonacci" to generate the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence

class Fibonacci
  # Method to generate the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
  def generate_sequence
    # Array to store the numbers
    sequence = [1, 1]

    # Loop to generate the next 8 numbers in the sequence
    8.times do
      # Add the sum of the last two numbers to the array
      sequence << sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]
    end

    # Print out the sequence
    puts "The first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: #{sequence}"
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Fibonacci class
fibonacci = Fibonacci.new

# Call the generate_sequence method
fibonacci.generate_sequence
