# This is a complex algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
# It uses the Euclidean algorithm and works for both positive and negative integers.
# Set variables a and b to the numbers you want to find the GCD for
a = 70  
b = 30  

# Define a method that takes in two parameters, a and b
def gcd(a, b)  
  # If b is equal to 0, return a as the GCD
  if b == 0  
    return a  
  # Otherwise, recursively call the method with b as the new a and the remainder of a/b as the new b
  else  
    return gcd(b, a % b)  
  end  
end  
  
# Print the result of calling the gcd method with variables a and b  
puts gcd(a, b)

# Output: 10
