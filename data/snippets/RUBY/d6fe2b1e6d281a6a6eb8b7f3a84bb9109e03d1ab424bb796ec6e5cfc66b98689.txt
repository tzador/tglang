# This code snippet declares a class named "Person" with three attributes
# It also defines three methods to set and get the attributes
# Finally, it creates a new instance of the Person class and prints out its attributes

class Person
  # defining the attributes with getter methods
  attr_reader :name, :age, :hobbies

  # defining the attributes with setter methods
  attr_writer :name, :age, :hobbies

  # initializing the attributes with default values
  def initialize(name = "", age = 0, hobbies = [])
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @hobbies = hobbies
  end

  # defining a method to add a new hobby to the hobbies array
  def add_hobby(new_hobby)
    @hobbies.push(new_hobby)
  end

  # defining a method to print out the person's name and age
  def get_info
    puts "My name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end

  # defining a method to print out the person's hobbies
  def show_hobbies
    puts "My hobbies include: "
    @hobbies.each do |hobby|
      puts "- #{hobby}"
    end
  end
end

# creating a new instance of the Person class and setting its attributes
person = Person.new("John", 25, ["reading", "painting"])

# calling the get_info method to print out the person's name and age
person.get_info

# adding a new hobby to the person's hobbies array using the add_hobby method
person.add_hobby("gardening")

# calling the show_hobbies method to print out all of the person's hobbies
person.show_hobbies

# changing the person's age by directly setting the attribute using the age= method
person.age = 26

# calling the get_info method again to print out the updated age
person.get_info
