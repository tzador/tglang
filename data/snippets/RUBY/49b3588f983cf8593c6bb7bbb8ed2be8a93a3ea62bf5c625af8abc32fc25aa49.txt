# This code snippet generates a random password and stores it in a variable

# Require the secure_random library to generate a random string
require 'securerandom'

# Define a method that generates a random password with the specified length
def generate_password(length)
  # Use the secure_random library to generate a random string of the specified length
  password = SecureRandom.hex(length)
  # Print the generated password for reference
  puts "Generated Password: #{password}"
  # Return the password to be stored in a variable
  return password
end

# Prompt the user for the length of the password they want
print "Enter password length: "
# Get user input and convert it to an integer
length = gets.to_i

# Call the generate_password method with the user input as the argument
password = generate_password(length)

# Print the stored password for confirmation
puts "Stored Password: #{password}"
