# This is a complex code snippet in RUBY that takes in a string and reverses the order of the words in the string

# define a method that takes in a string parameter
def reverse_string(string)
	# split the string into an array of words
	words = string.split(' ')

	# create an empty array to store the reversed words
	reversed = []

	# loop through the array of words in reverse order
	(words.length - 1).downto(0) do |i|
		# add each word to the reversed array
		reversed << words[i]
	end

	# join the reversed array elements into a string with a space between each word
	reversed_string = reversed.join(' ')

	# return the reversed string
	return reversed_string
end

# call the method and pass in a test string
puts reverse_string("Hello World!") # Output: "World! Hello"
