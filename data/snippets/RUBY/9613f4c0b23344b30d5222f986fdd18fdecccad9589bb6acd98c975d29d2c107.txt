## This is a program to calculate the Fibonacci sequence with user input

# Defining a method to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
def fibonacci_sequence(number)
  # Initializing an array to store the sequence
  sequence = [0, 1]

  # Looping through the sequence until the desired number is reached
  while sequence.length < number
    # Calculating the next number in the sequence by adding the two previous numbers
    next_number = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]

    # Appending the next number to the sequence array
    sequence << next_number
  end

  # Returning the generated sequence
  return sequence
end

# Asking for user input
print "Enter a number to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to: "

# Converting input to integer and storing it in a variable
input = gets.chomp.to_i

# Generating the Fibonacci sequence using the defined method
fibonacci_seq = fibonacci_sequence(input)

# Printing the result
puts "The Fibonacci sequence up to #{input} is: #{fibonacci_seq}"
