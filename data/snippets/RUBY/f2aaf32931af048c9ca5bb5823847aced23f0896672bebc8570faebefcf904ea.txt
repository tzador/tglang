# Define a method that takes in two parameters, start and end, that represents the range of numbers to iterate through
# Default values are set to 1 and 1000 respectively
def sum_even_numbers(start = 1, end_num = 1000)
  
  # Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the running total of even numbers
  total = 0
  
  # Loop through the given range of numbers, starting at the given start and ending at the given end
  (start..end_num).each do |num|
    
    # Check if the current number is even by using the modulo operator to check if the remainder after dividing by 2 is equal to 0
    if num % 2 == 0
      
      # If the number is even, add it to the running total
      total += num
      
      # Print out the current number to show which even number was added to the total
      puts "Even number added to the total: #{num}"

  # Print out the final total of all the even numbers
  puts "Final total of all even numbers between #{start} and #{end_num} is #{total}"

# Call the method with default values
sum_even_numbers

# Output:
# Even number added to the total: 2
# Even number added to the total: 4
# Even number added to the total: 6
# Even number added to the total: 8
# ... (remaining even numbers will be printed)
# Final total of all even numbers between 1 and 1000 is 250500
