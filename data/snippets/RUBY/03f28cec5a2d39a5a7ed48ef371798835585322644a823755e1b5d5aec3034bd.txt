# This code snippet creates a class called Animal
# with a constructor method that takes in a name and species
# It also has a method called sound which prints out a sound based on the species
# Finally, it creates an instance of the Animal class and calls the sound method

class Animal
  # defining the properties `name` and `species`
  attr_accessor :name, :species

  # constructor method that takes in `name` and `species` and sets them as instance variables
  def initialize(name, species)
    @name = name
    @species = species
  end

  # method that prints out a sound based on the species
  def sound
    case @species.downcase
    when "dog"
      puts "#{@name} says woof!"
    when "cat"
      puts "#{@name} says meow!"
    when "bird"
      puts "#{@name} says tweet!"
    else
      puts "#{@name} doesn't make a sound."
    end
  end
end

# creating an instance of the Animal class with name "Max" and species "Dog"
animal = Animal.new("Max", "Dog")
# calling the sound method to print out the sound
animal.sound
# output: Max says woof!
