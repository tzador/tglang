# This is a complex code snippet using the Ruby programming language.

class Employee # defines a new class called Employee
  attr_reader :name, :position # creates getter methods for name and position attributes
  attr_accessor :salary # creates getter and setter methods for salary attribute

  # initialize method to set name, position, and salary when new Employee object is created
  def initialize(name, position, salary)
    @name = name
    @position = position
    @salary = salary
  end

  # method to print employee's information
  def print_info
    puts "Name: #{@name}"
    puts "Position: #{@position}"
    puts "Salary: #{@salary}"
  end

  # method to give employee raise based on percentage
  def give_raise(percentage)
    @salary *= (1 + percentage)
    puts "#{@name} has received a #{percentage * 100}% raise!"
  end
end

# creating new instances of Employee
john = Employee.new("John Doe", "Manager", 50000)
jane = Employee.new("Jane Smith", "Assistant Manager", 40000)

# printing employee information
john.print_info
jane.print_info

# giving employees raises
john.give_raise(0.1)
jane.give_raise(0.2)

# output:
# Name: John Doe
# Position: Manager
# Salary: 50000
# Name: Jane Smith
# Position: Assistant Manager
# Salary: 40000
# John Doe has received a 10.0% raise!
# Jane Smith has received a 20.0% raise!
