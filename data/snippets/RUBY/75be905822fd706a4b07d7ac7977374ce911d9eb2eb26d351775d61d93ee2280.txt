# This is a sample code snippet in RUBY

# Define a class called "Person"
class Person
  # Create getters and setters for "name" and "age"
  attr_accessor :name, :age
  # Create a constructor method that sets the "name" and "age" variables
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  # Create a method called "greet" that prints a personalized greeting
  def greet
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create an instance of Person with name "John" and age 25
john = Person.new("John", 25)

# Call the "greet" method on the john instance
john.greet  #=> Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
