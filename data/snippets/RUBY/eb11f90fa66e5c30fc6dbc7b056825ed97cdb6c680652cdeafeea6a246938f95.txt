# Define a method for calculating the factorial of a number
def factorial(n)

  # Use a loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
  1.upto(n) do |i|
    # Multiply the current result with the current number
    result *= i
  end
  # Return the final result

# Call the method and print the output
puts factorial(5) # Output: 120
