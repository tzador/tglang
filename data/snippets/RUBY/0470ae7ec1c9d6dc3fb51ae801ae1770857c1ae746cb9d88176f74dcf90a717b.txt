# This is a Ruby program that calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height
# First, we define a function called `triangle_area` that takes in two parameters, `base` and `height`
def triangle_area(base, height)
  # We use an if statement to make sure the parameters are positive numbers
  if base > 0 && height > 0
    # We calculate the area of the triangle by multiplying the base and height and dividing by 2
    area = (base * height) / 2
    # We print the result using string interpolation
    puts "The area of the triangle is #{area}"
  else
    # If the parameters are not positive numbers, we raise an error and print a message to the user
    raise "Please provide positive numbers for the base and height"
  end
end

# We call the `triangle_area` function and pass in values for the base and height
