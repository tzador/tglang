# This code snippet creates a class named Person and defines two methods, initialize and display_details
# The initialize method takes in three parameters, name, age, and occupation
# The display_details method prints out the person's name, age, and occupation in a formatted string
# To create an instance of the Person class, the new method is used and pass in the required parameters
# Then, the display_details method is called to print out the details of the person
