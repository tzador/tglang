# This code snippet creates a class called "Person" with attributes such as name and age.
# Then, it creates a method within the "Person" class that calculates the person's birth year based on their age.
# Finally, the code creates an instance of the "Person" class and calls the birth_year method to display the person's birth year.

    birth_year = current_year - @age.to_i
