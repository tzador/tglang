# * This is a complex code snippet in Ruby

# Defining a class called "Car"
class Car

    # Initializing the class with the attributes "make" and "model"
    def initialize(make, model)
        @make = make
        @model = model
    end

    # Creating a method that returns the make of the car
    def get_make
        return @make
    end

    # Creating a method that returns the model of the car
    def get_model
        return @model
    end
end

# Creating an instance of the Car class
car = Car.new("Tesla", "Model S")

# Printing out the make and model using the class methods
puts "The make of the car is: #{car.get_make}"
puts "The model of the car is: #{car.get_model}"
