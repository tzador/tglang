# This is a complex code snippet that uses advanced data structures and algorithms in the Ruby programming language.
# We will be creating a function that takes in an array of strings and returns the most commonly occurring string in the array.
# We will be using a hash table to keep track of the frequency of each string in the array.

  # create an empty hash table to store the frequencies
  freq_table = Hash.new(0)

  # loop through the array and update the frequencies in the hash table
  arr.each do |string|
    freq_table[string] += 1
  end

  # set default values for the most common string and its frequency
  most_common_string = ""
  highest_freq = 0

  # loop through the hash table to find the most common string and its frequency
  freq_table.each do |string, frequency|
    if frequency > highest_freq
      most_common_string = string
      highest_freq = frequency
