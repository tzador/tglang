# This code snippet is an example of a method that returns the largest number in a given array.
# It uses the built-in 'max' method which returns the largest element in an array.

# Create a method called 'largest_number' that takes in an array as input
def largest_number(array)
  # Use the 'max' method to find the largest number in the given array
  largest = array.max
  # Print the largest number to the console
  puts "The largest number in the array is #{largest}."
end

# Create an array of numbers
numbers = [5, 2, 8, 12, 3, 22, 9]

# Call the 'largest_number' method and pass in the array as an argument
largest_number(numbers)

# Output:
# The largest number in the array is 22.
