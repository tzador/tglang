# This program performs binary search on an array

def binary_search(arr, target)
  left = 0
  right = arr.length - 1
  while left <= right
    mid = (left + right) / 2
    if arr[mid] == target
      return mid

# Example usage
arr = [1, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15]
target = 8
index = binary_search(arr, target)
puts "Target #{target} is located at index #{index}" 
# Output: Target 8 is located at index 2
