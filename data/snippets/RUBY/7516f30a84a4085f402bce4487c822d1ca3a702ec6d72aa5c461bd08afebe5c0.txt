# This function takes in three parameters and calculates the volume of a cylinder
def calculate_cylinder_volume(height, radius, pi = Math::PI)
  # Assigns the calculation of the base area to a variable called base_area
  base_area = pi * (radius ** 2)
  # Assigns the calculation of the cylinder volume to a variable called volume
  volume = base_area * height
  # Returns the calculated volume
  return volume
end

# Calls the function and prints the result
puts(calculate_cylinder_volume(10, 5))
# Output: 785.3981633974483
