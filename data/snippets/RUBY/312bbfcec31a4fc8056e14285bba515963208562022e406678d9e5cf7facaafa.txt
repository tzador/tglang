# This code snippet uses a method to calculate the factorial of a number
# Define the method
def factorial(n)
  # Initialize a variable to store the result
  result = 1
  # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
  for i in 1..n
    # Multiply the current result with the current number
    result = result * i
  end
  # Print the result
  puts "The factorial of #{n} is #{result}"
end

# Ask user for input
print "Enter a number: "
# Store user input in a variable and convert it to integer
num = gets.chomp.to_i

# Call the factorial method with the input number as argument
factorial(num)
