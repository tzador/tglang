# This code snippet creates a class called "Animal" with three instance variables - name, age, and species.
# It also defines four methods - two getter methods for name and age, and two setter methods for name and species.

class Animal
  # Getter and setter for name
  attr_accessor :name

  # Getter for age
  attr_reader :age

  # Getter and setter for species
  attr_accessor :species

  # Constructor to initialize instance variables
  def initialize(name, age, species)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @species = species
  end

  # Override method to print out animal's information
  def to_s
    "Name: #{@name}, Age: #{@age}, Species: #{@species}"
  end
end

# Create a new instance of Animal with name, age, and species
cat = Animal.new("Fluffy", 5, "Cat")

# Print out the animal's information
puts cat

# Change the animal's name and species using the setter methods
cat.name = "Max"
cat.species = "Dog"

# Print out the updated information
puts cat
