# This is a Ruby code snippet that shows how to create a class and use control flow statements to process data.
# First, we define a class named "Person" that has two instance variables, "name" and "age".
class Person
  # Initialize method to set the name and age of the person object.
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  # Method to print out a greeting and the person's name.
  def greet
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name}."
  end

  # Method to check if the person is older than 18 years old.
  def is_adult?
    if @age > 18
      puts "This person is an adult."
    else
      puts "This person is not an adult."
    end
  end
end

# Create a new person object with name "John" and age 20.
john = Person.new("John", 20)

# Create a new person object with name "Lisa" and age 15.
lisa = Person.new("Lisa", 15)

# Call the greet method on the john object.
john.greet

# Call the is_adult? method on the john and lisa objects.
john.is_adult?
lisa.is_adult?

# Output:
# Hello, my name is John.
# This person is an adult.
# This person is not an adult.
