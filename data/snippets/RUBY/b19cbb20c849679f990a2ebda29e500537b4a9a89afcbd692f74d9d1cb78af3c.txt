# A nested loop that calculates and prints the average speed of a car
# traveling for a certain amount of time at varying speeds
# Note: speed_array is an array containing the speeds of the car at each time interval

def average_speed(speed_array)
    total_distance = 0 # initialize total distance
    total_time = 0 # initialize total time
    speed_array.each do |speed|
        total_distance += speed # add to total distance
        total_time += 1 # increase total time by 1
    end
    average_speed = total_distance / total_time # calculate average speed
    puts "The average speed of the car is #{average_speed} km/h"
end

# Example usage:
speed_array = [40, 60, 50, 70, 55, 75, 45] # speeds in km/h
average_speed(speed_array) # should output "The average speed of the car is 56.42857142857 km/h"
