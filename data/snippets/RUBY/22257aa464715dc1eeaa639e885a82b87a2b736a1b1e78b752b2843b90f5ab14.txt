# This method uses a conditional statement to print "Fizz" if the input is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if the input is divisible by 5,
# "FizzBuzz" if the input is divisible by 15, and the input itself if it is not divisible by any of those numbers.
# The ".to_s" method is used to convert the input into a string before returning it.
# This ensures that the final output will always be a string.
