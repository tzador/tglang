# This is a complex code snippet in Ruby that outputs the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, with annotations for understanding

# Define a method to generate the Fibonacci numbers
def generate_fibonacci(num)
  fibonacci = [0, 1] # Initialize the first two numbers in the sequence
  (2..num).each do |n| # Loop through the remaining numbers
    fibonacci << fibonacci[n-1] + fibonacci[n-2] # Add the previous two numbers to generate the next number in the sequence
  end
  return fibonacci.slice(0, num) # Return the first 10 numbers in the sequence
end

# Call the method and pass in the argument for the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate
result = generate_fibonacci(10)

# Print out the result
puts "The first 10 Fibonacci numbers are #{result}"
