# This is a complex code snippet in RUBY that calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function

# Define a method to calculate factorial recursively
def factorial(x)
  # Base case
  if x == 0 || x == 1
    return 1
  else
    # Recursive call to factorial method with x-1 as parameter
    return x * factorial(x-1)
  end
end

# User input for the number whose factorial needs to be calculated
print "Enter a number: "
num = gets.chomp.to_i

# Call the factorial method and store the result in a variable
result = factorial(num)

# Print the result
puts "The factorial of #{num} is #{result}."

# Output:
#
