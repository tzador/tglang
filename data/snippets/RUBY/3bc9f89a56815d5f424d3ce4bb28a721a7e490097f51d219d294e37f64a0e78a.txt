def fibonacci(n)
  # This method calculates the n-th term in the Fibonacci sequence
  # Input: Integer n representing the term number
  # Output: Integer representing the n-th term

  # initialize array with first two terms
  sequence = [0, 1]

  # iterate from third term to n-th term
  (2..n).each do |i|
    # calculate n-th term by adding previous two terms
    sequence[i] = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]
  end

  # return n-th term
  return sequence[n]
end

puts fibonacci(10) # Output: 55
puts fibonacci(15) # Output: 610
