# Using the ternary operator to check if a number is even
num = 6

is_even = (num % 2 == 0) ? true : false
# is_even will store the boolean value true since num is an even number

# Using a loop to generate an array of multiples of 3
multiples_of_three = []

for i in 1..10 do
    multiples_of_three << i * 3
end
# multiples_of_three will store the array [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]

# Creating a hash with string keys and integer values
hash = {
    "apple" => 5,
    "banana" => 3,
    "orange" => 8,
    "grape" => 10
}

# Accessing an element in the hash and printing it
puts "There are #{hash["apple"]} apples in the basket."
# Output: There are 5 apples in the basket.

# Defining a method to check if a string is a palindrome
def is_palindrome?(string)
    # Removing all non-alphanumeric characters and downcasing the string
    # This ensures that capitalization and special characters do not affect the result
    string = string.gsub(/\W+/, '').downcase
    # Checking if the string is equal to its reverse
    string == string.reverse
end

# Calling the method and printing the result
puts is_palindrome?("Racecar")
# Output: true
