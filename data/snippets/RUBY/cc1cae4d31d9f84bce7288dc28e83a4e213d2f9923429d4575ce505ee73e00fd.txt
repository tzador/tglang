# This is a complex code snippet that uses multiple programming concepts and functions in the Ruby language

# Define a class called Animal
class Animal

  # Create a class variable and set it equal to 0
  @@count = 0

  # Define a class method that prints a message about the class
  def self.about
    puts "This is the Animal class. It keeps track of how many animals have been created."
  end

  # Define an initialization method that takes in a name and type argument
  def initialize(name, type)
    @name = name
    @type = type

    # Increment the class variable by 1 every time an instance of the class is created
    @@count += 1
  end

  # Define an instance method that returns the name of the animal
  def name
    @name
  end

  # Define an instance method that returns the type of the animal
  def type

  # Define a class method that returns the number of animals that have been created
  def self.count

# Create a new instance of the Animal class

# Call the about class method on the Animal class
Animal.about

# Call the count class method on the Animal class to see how many animals have been created
Animal.count
