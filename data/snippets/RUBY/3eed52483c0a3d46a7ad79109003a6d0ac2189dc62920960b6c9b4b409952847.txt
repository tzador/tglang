# This is a sample method in Ruby that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers within the array

def sum_of_evens(arr)
  sum = 0 # initialize a variable to store the sum
  arr.each do |num|
    if num % 2 == 0 # check if the number is even
      sum += num # add the number to the sum variable
    end
  end
  return sum # return the sum as the output of the method
end

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
puts sum_of_evens(nums) # Output: 6
