# This code snippet generates a Fibonacci series up to the given number

# Prompt user for input
puts "How many numbers in the Fibonacci series do you want to generate?"

# Convert user input to integer
num = gets.chomp.to_i

# Define an array to store the Fibonacci numbers
fib = [0, 1]

# Loop through the numbers up to the given number
(2...num).each do |i|
    # Add the previous two Fibonacci numbers to get the next one and store in array
    fib << fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]
end

# Print the Fibonacci series
puts "Fibonacci Series up to #{num}:"
puts fib.join(', ')
