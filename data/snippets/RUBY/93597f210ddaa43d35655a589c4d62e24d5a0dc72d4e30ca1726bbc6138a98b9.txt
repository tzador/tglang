# This is a comment explaining the purpose of the following code
# Creating a class called "Employee" 
class Employee
    # creating a getter and setter method for "name" attribute
    attr_accessor :name
    # initializing the class with a "name" parameter
    def initialize(name)
        @name = name
    end

    # defining a method "calculate_salary" that takes in "hours_worked" parameter
    # and calculates the total salary based on hourly rate of 15
    # returns a string with the employee's name and total salary
    def calculate_salary(hours_worked)
        total_salary = hours_worked * 15
        return "#{name} earned a total salary of $#{total_salary} this month."
    end
end

# creating an instance of the "Employee" class with name set to "John"
employee = Employee.new("John")
# calling the "calculate_salary" method with hours worked set to 160
puts employee.calculate_salary(160)
