# The function accepts a positive integer n as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

# example output: fibonacci(6) would return 8, since the 6th number in the sequence is 8.

puts "Enter a number to find its corresponding Fibonacci number:"
n = gets.chomp.to_i # gets user input and converts it to an integer

# calls fibonacci method and passes in user input as argument
result = fibonacci(n)

puts "The #{n}th number in the Fibonacci sequence is: #{result}" # prints result

# Output: 
# Enter a number to find its corresponding Fibonacci number:
# 6
# The 6th number in the Fibonacci sequence is: 8
