# The library catalog is stored as a nested hash, with the top level keys representing different types of media (books and movies). Each media type is further divided into genres, with each genre having a hash of its own containing specific details about individual items

# To access a specific book in the catalog, we can use the following code:
puts library_catalog[:books][:fantasy][:author]
# This will output the author of the fantasy book "The Hobbit" which is "J. R. R. Tolkien"

# To access a specific movie in the catalog, we can use the following code:
puts library_catalog[:movies][:comedy][:year]
# This will output the year of the comedy movie "The Princess Bride" which is 1987

# To update the available quantity of a specific book, we can use the following code:
library_catalog[:books][:science_fiction][:available] = 8
puts library_catalog[:books][:science_fiction][:available]
# This will update the available quantity of the science fiction book "Dune" to 8 and then output the new quantity
