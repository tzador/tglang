 # This method prints out a greeting with the person's name and age
  def greet
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."

# This code creates a new instance of the Person class named John with name "John" and age 25
John = Person.new("John", 25)

# This code calls the greet method on the John instance, printing out a greeting with his name and age
John.greet

# This code calls the celebrate_birthday method on the John instance, incrementing his age by 1
John.celebrate_birthday

# This code calls the greet method again, now printing out his updated age
