# This code snippet creates a method called fibonacci that takes in a number
# and recursively calculates and returns the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.

# Define the fibonacci method with one parameter
def fibonacci(n)
  # Base case - if n is 0 or 1, return n
  return n if n == 0 || n == 1
  # Recursive case - calculate the fibonacci sequence for n-2 and n-1
  # and add them together to get the value for n
  fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
end

# Call the fibonacci method and pass in a number
fibonacci(10)
