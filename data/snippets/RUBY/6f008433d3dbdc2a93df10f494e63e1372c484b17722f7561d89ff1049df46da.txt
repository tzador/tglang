# This code snippet takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array.
# Input array
arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# Initialize a variable to store the sum
sum = 0

# Loop through the array
arr.each do |num|
  # Check if the number is even
  if num % 2 == 0
    # Add the number to the sum variable
    sum += num
  end
end

#Print the sum
puts sum

# Output: 30
