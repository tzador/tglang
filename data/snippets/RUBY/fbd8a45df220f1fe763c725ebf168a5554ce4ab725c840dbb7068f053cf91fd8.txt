# This program calculates the average of three numbers and prints it to the console

# Define a method that takes three arguments (numbers) and calculates the sum
def sum(num1, num2, num3)
  # Add all three numbers together and store the sum in a variable
  total = num1 + num2 + num3
  # Return the sum divided by the number of arguments to get the average
  return total / 3.0
end

# Prompt the user to enter three numbers and store them in variables
puts "Enter the first number:"
num1 = gets.chomp.to_f
puts "Enter the second number:"
num2 = gets.chomp.to_f
puts "Enter the third number:"
num3 = gets.chomp.to_f

# Call the method and pass in the three numbers as arguments
# Print the result to the console using string interpolation
puts "The average of #{num1}, #{num2}, and #{num3} is: #{sum(num1, num2, num3)}"
