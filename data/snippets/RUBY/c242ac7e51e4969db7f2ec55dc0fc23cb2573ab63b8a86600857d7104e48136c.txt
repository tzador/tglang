=begin

This is a long and complex code snippet in the RUBY programming language.

The code snippet below is a class called "Vehicle" with three instance variables, a constructor method, getter and setter methods, and a custom method that calculates the average speed of the vehicle.

=end

class Vehicle
  attr_accessor :make, :model, :year # defining instance variables

  def initialize(make, model, year) # constructor method
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
  end

  def get_make # getter method
    return @make
  end

  def set_model(model) # setter method
    @model = model
  end

  def calculate_avg_speed(distance, time) # custom method
    avg_speed = distance / time
    puts "The average speed of the #{@year} #{@make} #{@model} is #{avg_speed} miles per hour."
  end
end

# creating an instance of the "Vehicle" class
my_car = Vehicle.new("Toyota", "Camry", 2015)

# calling the getter and setter methods
puts "The make of my car is #{my_car.get_make}."
my_car.set_model("Corolla")
puts "The model of my car has been updated to #{my_car.model}."

# calling the custom method to calculate average speed
my_car.calculate_avg_speed(120, 2.5)

=begin
Output:
The make of my car is Toyota.
The model of my car has been updated to Corolla.
The average speed of the 2015 Toyota Corolla is 48.0 miles per hour.
