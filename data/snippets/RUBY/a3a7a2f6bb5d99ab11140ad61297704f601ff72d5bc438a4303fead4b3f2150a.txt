# set of numbers using the rand function

# Generate an array of 10 random numbers
numbers = Array.new(10) { rand(1..100) }

# Print the numbers to the console
print "Random Numbers: "
numbers.each { |num| print "#{num} " }

# Calculate the sum of the numbers
sum = 0
numbers.each { |num| sum += num }

# Print the sum to the console
print "\nSum: #{sum}"

# Calculate the average of the numbers
average = sum / numbers.length

# Print the average to the console
print "\nAverage: #{average}"
