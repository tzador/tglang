# This code snippet uses recursion to find the factorial of a given number
## First, we define a method called factorial which takes in a single parameter, num
def factorial(num)
  if num == 0 # base case, when num is 0, return 1
    return 1
  else
    return num * factorial(num - 1) # recursively call factorial method with num - 1
  end
end

puts factorial(5) # should output 120, the factorial of 5
