# This code snippet is a simple example of a "factorial" function in Ruby.

# The function takes in a positive integer and calculates its factorial value.

# Define the factorial function
def factorial(n)
    # Set the initial result to 1
    result = 1
    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    (1..n).each do |num|
        # Multiply the result by the current number
        result *= num
    end
    # Return the final result
    return result
end

# Call the function and print the result
puts factorial(6)
# Output: 720
