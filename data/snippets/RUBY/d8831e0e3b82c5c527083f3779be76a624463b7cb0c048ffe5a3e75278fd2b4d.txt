#This code snippet is a function that calculates the nth fibonacci number

#Function that calculates the nth fibonacci number, recursively
def fibonacci(n)
  if (n < 0)
    return "Invalid input. n must be 0 or greater."
  elsif (n == 0 || n == 1)
    return n
  else
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
  end
end

#Example input of n = 10
puts fibonacci(10)

#Output:
#55 

#Explanation:
#In this snippet, we first define a function called 'fibonacci' that takes in a parameter 'n' representing the position of the desired fibonacci number.
#We then use a conditional statement to check if the input 'n' is less than 0, which would be an invalid input for the fibonacci sequence.
#If 'n' is 0 or 1, we simply return 'n' as the fibonacci numbers at these positions are already known to be 0 and 1.
#For any other value of 'n', we use recursion to calculate the fibonacci number at position 'n' by adding the previous two fibonacci numbers.
#Lastly, we test the function by inputting 'n = 10' and printing the output, which should be the 10th fibonacci number, 55.
