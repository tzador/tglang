def palindrome?(str)
  # Checks if the given string is a palindrome.
  # A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward.
  # Example: "racecar"
  # Input: str - a string to be checked
  
  reversed = str.reverse
  # Reverses the string and assigns it to a variable
  
  return true if str == reversed
  # If the original string is equal to the reversed string, return true.
  # This indicates that the string is indeed a palindrome.

  false
  # If the string is not equal to its reversed version, return false.
