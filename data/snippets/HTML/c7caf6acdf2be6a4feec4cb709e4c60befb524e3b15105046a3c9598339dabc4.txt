    <h1>This is a Code Snippet</h1>
    <p>This is a complex code snippet in HTML that is designed to be used for generating code snippets in other languages. It includes various elements such as a doctype declaration, an HTML tag with a head and body, a style tag with CSS rules, and a container div with a heading and paragraph elements. It also includes a media query for responsive design.</p>
    <p>If you want to generate your own code snippets, you can easily modify this template for your needs. Just make sure to keep the essential elements, such as the doctype and HTML tag, in place.</p>
