    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a long and complex code snippet written in HTML. It includes a doctype declaration, opening and closing HTML tags, a head section with a title, a script tag linking to an external JavaScript file, and a style tag with CSS to style the body, h1, and p elements. There is also a header and paragraph element within the body, with their own styles applied.</p>
