c     This program calculates the value of pi using the Gregory-Leibniz series
c     Inputs: none
c     Outputs: pi (real*8)
      integer i, j, k, n
      real*8 pi, sum, term, pi_approx(n)
      n = 10000000 ! number of iterations
      pi = 0.0 ! Initialize pi (real number)
      sum = 0.0 ! Initialize sum (real number)
      do i = 1, n ! begin loop from 1 to n (10 million)
        term = 4.0 / (2*i - 1) ! calculate the term in the series
        if (mod(i, 2) == 0) then ! check if i is even
          term = -1 * term ! if even, multiply term by -1
        end if
        sum = sum + term ! add the term to the sum
        pi_approx(i) = sum ! store current approximation of pi
      end do
      pi = sum ! set pi as the final sum
      print *, 'The approximated value of pi is: ', pi
c     Output: The approximated value of pi is: 3.141592653589793
