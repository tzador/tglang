PROGRAM complex_num_calculator
! Program to calculate the sum of two complex numbers in FORTRAN

IMPLICIT NONE
! To ensure all variables are declared explicitly

COMPLEX :: num1, num2
! Declaring two complex numbers

REAL :: real_part1, real_part2, sum1
! Declaring two real numbers and one sum variable

integer :: imag_part1, imag_part2, sum2
! Declaring two integers for the imaginary parts and one sum variable

! Getting the input from user for the first complex number
WRITE(*, "(A)", advance="no") "Enter the real part of the first complex number: "
READ(*, *) real_part1
WRITE(*, "(A)", advance="no") "Enter the imaginary part of the first complex number: "
READ(*, *) imag_part1

!Assigning the values to num1
num1 = (real_part1, imag_part1)

! Getting the input from user for the second complex number
WRITE(*, "(A)", advance="no") "Enter the real part of the second complex number: "
READ(*, *) real_part2
WRITE(*, "(A)", advance="no") "Enter the imaginary part of the second complex number: "
READ(*, *) imag_part2

!Assigning the values to num2
num2 = (real_part2, imag_part2)

! Calculating the sum of the complex numbers using FORTRAN's built-in function "CADD"
sum1 = CADD(num1, num2)

! Printing the result to the user
WRITE(*, "(A)") "The sum of the two complex numbers is: "
