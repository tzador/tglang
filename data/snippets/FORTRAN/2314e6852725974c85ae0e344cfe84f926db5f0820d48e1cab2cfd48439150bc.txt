! This code snippet is a program that calculates the factorial of a given number
PROGRAM FactorialCalculation

    ! Declare variables and arrays
    INTEGER :: num, factorial
    INTEGER :: i
    INTEGER, DIMENSION(10) :: factorialArray
    
    ! Get input from user
    PRINT *, "Enter a number: "
    READ *, num
    
    ! Calculate factorial using a loop
    factorial = 1
    DO i = 1,num
        factorial = factorial * i
    END DO
    
    ! Print result
    PRINT *, "Factorial of ", num, " is ", factorial
    
    ! Calculate factorials for numbers 1 to 10 and store in an array
    DO i = 1,10
        factorialArray(i) = factorial(i)
    END DO
