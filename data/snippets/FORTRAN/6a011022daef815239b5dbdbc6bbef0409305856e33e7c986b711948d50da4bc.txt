SUBROUTINE QUADRATIC(A,B,C,X1,X2)
 C     This subroutine calculates the roots of a quadratic equation
 C     with coefficients A, B, and C.
 C
 C     Input:
 C         A - coefficient of x^2 term
 C         B - coefficient of x term
 C         C - constant term
 C
 C     Output:
 C         X1 - first root of the equation
 C         X2 - second root of the equation
 C
 C     Declare variables
       REAL A,B,C,X1,X2,D
 C
 C     Calculate discriminant
       D = B**2 - 4.0*A*C
 C
 C     Check if roots are complex
       IF (D.LT.0.0) THEN
          WRITE(*,*) 'Roots are complex'
          STOP
       END IF
 C
 C     Calculate first root
       X1 = (-B + SQRT(D)) / (2.0*A)
 C
 C     Calculate second root
       X2 = (-B - SQRT(D)) / (2.0*A)
 C
 C     Print roots to console
       WRITE(*,*) 'X1 = ', X1
       WRITE(*,*) 'X2 = ', X2
