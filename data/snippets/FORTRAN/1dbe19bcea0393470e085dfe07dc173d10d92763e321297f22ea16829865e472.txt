! This is a complex code snippet in FORTRAN
PROGRAM complex_code
! This program calculates the Taylor series expansion of sin(x) using do-while loops
! Input: x (real number)
! Output: sin(x) (real number)
IMPLICIT NONE
REAL :: x, sin_x, term, factorial
INTEGER :: i, n
! Read in the value of x
READ*, x
! Set the value of sin(x) to zero initially
sin_x = 0.0
! Set the first term of the Taylor series expansion
term = x
! Set the initial value of factorial to 1
factorial = 1
! Set the initial value of n to 1
n = 1
! Start the do-while loop
DO WHILE(term/=0.0)
! Compute the factorial of n
DO i = 1, n
factorial = factorial * i
END DO
! Calculate the next term in the Taylor series expansion
term = x**(2*n+1) / factorial
! Add the current term to the value of sin(x)
sin_x = sin_x + term
! Increment n by 1 for the next iteration
n = n + 1
END DO
! Print the final value of sin(x)
PRINT*, "sin(",x,") = ", sin_x
