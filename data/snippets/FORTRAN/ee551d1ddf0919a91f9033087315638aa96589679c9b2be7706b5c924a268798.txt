! This program calculates the roots of a quadratic equation
program quad_equ
implicit none

! Declare variables
real :: a, b, c		! coefficients of x^2, x, 1
real :: delta		! discriminant
real :: x1, x2		! roots of the equation

! Ask user for input
write(*,*) "Enter the coefficients of the quadratic equation (a, b, c):"
read(*,*) a, b, c

! Calculate discriminant
delta = b**2 - 4*a*c

! Check if the equation has real roots
if (delta >= 0) then
	x1 = (-b + sqrt(delta)) / (2*a)
	x2 = (-b - sqrt(delta)) / (2*a)

	write(*,*) "The roots of the equation are:", x1, x2
else
	write(*,*) "The equation does not have real roots."
end if
