! Example usage of the subroutine
PROGRAM MEAN_SD_EXAMPLE
  IMPLICIT NONE
  INTEGER :: SIZE
  REAL :: DATA(SIZE)
  REAL :: AVG, STDEV

  ! Prompt the user for the size of the array
  PRINT *, "Enter the size of the array: "
  READ *, SIZE

  ! Prompt the user for the values in the array
  PRINT *, "Enter the values of the array: "
  DO I = 1, SIZE

  END DO

  ! Call the MEAN_SD subroutine to calculate the mean and standard deviation
  CALL MEAN_SD(SIZE, DATA, AVG, STDEV)

  ! Print the results
  PRINT *, "The mean is: ", AVG
  PRINT *, "The standard deviation is: ", STDEV
