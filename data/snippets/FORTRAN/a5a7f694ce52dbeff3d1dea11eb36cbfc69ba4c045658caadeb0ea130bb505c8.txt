PROGRAM COMPLEX_CALC
! This program performs complex calculations using FORTRAN.

! Define variables for real and imaginary parts of complex numbers.
REAL A, B, C, D
COMPLEX RESULT

! Assign values to variables.
A = 5.0
B = 3.0
C = 2.0
D = -4.0

! Perform complex addition and assign result to RESULT variable.
RESULT = CMPLX(A, B) + CMPLX(C, D)

! Print out the result.
PRINT *, "The sum of the complex numbers is:", RESULT

! Perform complex multiplication and assign result to RESULT variable.
RESULT = CMPLX(A, B) * CMPLX(C, D)

! Print out the result.
PRINT *, "The product of the complex numbers is:", RESULT

! Perform complex division and assign result to RESULT variable.
RESULT = CMPLX(A, B) / CMPLX(C, D)

! Print out the result.
PRINT *, "The quotient of the complex numbers is:", RESULT

! Close the program.
