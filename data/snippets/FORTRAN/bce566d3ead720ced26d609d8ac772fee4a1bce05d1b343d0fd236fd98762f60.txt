! Program to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
  !! Initializing variables
  INTEGER i, n
  REAL fibnum(100)

  !! Getting input from user
  READ(*,*) n

  !! Calculating the first two numbers in the sequence
  fibnum(1) = 0.0
  fibnum(2) = 1.0

  !! Loop to calculate remaining numbers
  DO i = 3, n
    fibnum(i) = fibnum(i-1) + fibnum(i-2)
  END DO

  !! Printing the nth Fibonacci number
  WRITE(*,*) "The nth Fibonacci number is: ", fibnum(n)
END
