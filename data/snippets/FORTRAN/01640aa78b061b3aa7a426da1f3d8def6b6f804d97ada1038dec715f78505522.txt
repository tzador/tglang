PROGRAM complex_number
  IMPLICIT NONE

  !This program performs basic operations on complex numbers

  !Declaring variables
  COMPLEX :: num1, num2, result
  REAL :: real_part, imag_part

  !Initializing complex numbers with user input
  WRITE(*,*) "Enter the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number:"
  READ(*,*) real_part, imag_part
  num1 = CMPLX(real_part, imag_part)

  WRITE(*,*) "Enter the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number:"
  READ(*,*) real_part, imag_part
  num2 = CMPLX(real_part, imag_part)

  !Performing addition operation
  result = num1 + num2
  WRITE(*,*) "Addition result:", result

  !Performing subtraction operation
  result = num1 - num2
  WRITE(*,*) "Subtraction result:", result

  !Performing multiplication operation
  result = num1 * num2
  WRITE(*,*) "Multiplication result:", result

  !Performing division operation
  result = num1 / num2
  WRITE(*,*) "Division result:", result
