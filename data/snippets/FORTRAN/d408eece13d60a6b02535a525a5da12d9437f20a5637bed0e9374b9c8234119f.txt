! This is a FORTRAN code snippet that calculates the first 100 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
! First, we define all the necessary variables and constants
integer :: n, i
real :: fibo(100)    ! Array to store the Fibonacci sequence
fibo(1) = 0.0        ! First number in the sequence is always 0
fibo(2) = 1.0        ! Second number in the sequence is always 1

! Now we use a DO loop to calculate the remaining numbers in the sequence
do i = 3, 100      ! Loop from the third number to the 100th number
    fibo(i) = fibo(i-1) + fibo(i-2)    ! Fibonacci sequence formula: F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
end do

! Finally, we use another DO loop to print out the first 100 numbers in the sequence
do i = 1, 100      ! Loop from the first number to the 100th number
    print *, "Fibonacci number ", i, " is: ", fibo(i)     ! Print out the number and its index
end do
