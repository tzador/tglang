program fibonacci
  ! This program calculates the first 10 numbers of the fibonacci sequence.
  integer :: n ! variable to define the total number of elements
  integer :: i ! loop variable
  integer(8), dimension(10) :: sequence ! array to store fibonacci numbers

  sequence(1) = 0 ! first element of the sequence
  sequence(2) = 1 ! second element of the sequence

  read*, n ! user input for total number of elements

  do i = 3, n ! loop to generate remaining elements
    sequence(i) = sequence(i-1) + sequence(i-2) ! fibonacci formula
  end do

  print*, "The first", n, "numbers of the fibonacci sequence are:" ! print statement
  do i = 1, n ! loop to print the elements of the sequence
    print*, sequence(i) ! print each element
  end do

  end program fibonacci
