program complexMath
!-- Program to perform complex mathematical operations 
!-- using complex numbers in FORTRAN

!-- Define variables for real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers
real :: real1, real2, img1, img2
complex :: comp1, comp2

!-- Read in values for real and imaginary parts
!- of the first complex number
print *, 'Enter real part of the first complex number:'
read *, real1
print *, 'Enter imaginary part of the first complex number:'
read *, img1

!-- Read in values for real and imaginary parts
!-- of the second complex number
print *, 'Enter real part of the second complex number:'
read *, real2
print *, 'Enter imaginary part of the second complex number:'
read *, img2

!-- Construct the two complex numbers
comp1 = (real1, img1)
comp2 = (real2, img2)

!-- Print out the two complex numbers
print *, 'The first complex number is:', comp1
print *, 'The second complex number is:', comp2

!-- Perform complex arithmetic operations on the two numbers 
!-- and print out the results
print *, 'Sum of the two complex numbers:', comp1 + comp2
print *, 'Difference of the two complex numbers:', comp1 - comp2
print *, 'Product of the two complex numbers:', comp1 * comp2
print *, 'Division of the two complex numbers:', comp1 / comp2

!-- Calculate the conjugate of the first complex number 
comp1_conj = cmplx(real1, -img1)

!-- Print out the conjugate of the first complex number
print *, 'Conjugate of the first complex number:', comp1_conj

!-- Calculate the absolute value of the second complex number
comp2_abs = cmplx(real2, img2)
print *, 'Absolute value of the second complex number:', abs(comp2_abs)

!-- Calculate the square root of the first complex number
comp1_sqrt = sqrt(comp1)
print *, 'Square root of the first complex number:', comp1_sqrt

!-- Calculate the exponential of the second complex number
comp2_exp = exp(comp2)
print *, 'Exponential of the second complex number:', comp2_exp

!-- Calculate the natural logarithm of the first complex number
comp1_ln = log(comp1)
print *, 'Natural logarithm of the first complex number:', comp1_ln

!-- Calculate the sine of the second complex number
comp2_sin = sin(comp2)
print *, 'Sine of the second complex number:', comp2_sin

!-- Calculate the cosine of the first complex number
comp1_cos = cos(comp1)
print *, 'Cosine of the first complex number:', comp1_cos
