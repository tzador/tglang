program fibonacci

! This program uses the FORTRAN programming language to generate the first
! 25 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

implicit none

! Declare variables for storing the initial terms of the sequence, as well
! as the counter and the maximum number of terms to generate.
integer :: term1, term2
integer :: counter = 2
integer, parameter :: max_terms = 25

! Initialize the first two terms of the sequence.
term1 = 0
term2 = 1

! Use a DO loop to generate the remaining terms of the sequence.
do while (counter < max_terms)
    ! Calculate the next term in the sequence.
    term2 = term1 + term2
    ! Print the current term.
    print *, term2
    ! Update the previous terms for the next iteration.
    term1 = term2 - term1
    ! Increment the counter.
    counter = counter + 1
end do
