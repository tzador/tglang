! This code snippet calculates the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method

program calculate_pi
    implicit none
    integer :: n_points, n_inside = 0 ! variables to store the total number of points and points inside the unit circle
    real :: x, y, pi ! variables to store random coordinates and the calculated value of pi

    print*, "Enter the number of points to use in the calculation:"
    read*, n_points  ! prompt user to enter the number of points

    do i = 1, n_points ! loop through each point
        call random_number(x) ! generate a random number between 0 and 1 for x coordinate
        call random_number(y) ! generate a random number between 0 and 1 for y coordinate
        if (x**2 + y**2 <= 1) then ! check if the point falls inside the unit circle
            n_inside = n_inside + 1 ! increment the number of points inside the unit circle
        end if
    end do

    pi = 4 * n_inside / n_points ! calculate the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method

    print*, "The calculated value of pi is:", pi  ! print the result

end program calculate_pi
