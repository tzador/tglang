program fibonacci

! This program calculates and prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

implicit none

! Declare variables to hold the values.

integer :: n = 10 ! number of terms to be calculated
integer :: i ! loop counter
integer :: fib(n) ! array to store the Fibonacci numbers
integer :: a = 0, b = 1, c ! variables to calculate the next number in the sequence

! Calculate the first two numbers in the sequence (0 and 1).
fib(1) = 0
fib(2) = 1

! Use a loop to calculate the remaining numbers.
do i = 3, n
  c = a + b ! calculation formula for Fibonacci sequence
  a = b
  b = c
  fib(i) = c ! store the calculated number in the array
end do

! Print the array containing the Fibonacci numbers.
print*, 'Fibonacci sequence:'
do i = 1, n
  print*, fib(i)
end do

end program fibonacci
