program complex_numbers ! defines program name
implicit none ! avoids assuming implicit data types
integer :: n = 10 ! declares integer variable with initial value of 10
complex :: a(n), b(n) ! declares complex arrays with size n
complex :: c ! declares complex variable
real :: x = 0.0 ! declares real variable with initial value of 0.0
do i = 1, n ! do loop from 1 to n
	a(i) = cmplx(i, i+1) ! assigns complex value of i + i+1i to a(i)
	b(i) = a(i) + cmplx(0,10) ! adds a constant complex value of 10i to a(i) and assigns to b(i)
end do ! end of do loop
c = sum(b) ! sums all elements in array b and assigns to c
x = abs(c) ! assigns absolute value of c to x
print *, "The sum of the complex array is ", x ! prints the result with a message
end program ! end of program
