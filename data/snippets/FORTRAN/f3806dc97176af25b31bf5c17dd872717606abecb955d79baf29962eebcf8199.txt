! This code snippet is written in FORTRAN
! It calculates and prints out the first 50 terms of the Fibonacci sequence

program fibonacci

  ! Prompt user for number of terms
  write(*,*) "Enter the number of terms you want in the Fibonacci sequence: "
  read(*,*) num_terms

  ! Check if number of terms is valid
  if (num_terms < 2) then
    write(*,*) "Number of terms must be at least 2"
    stop
