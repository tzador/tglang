! This program calculates the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method
program monte_carlo_pi

    ! Creates an array to store the calculated values of pi
    real, dimension(10) :: pi_values

    ! Sets the number of points to be used in the calculation
    integer :: num_points = 1000000
    
    ! Defines variables for counting points inside and outside the circle
    integer :: inside = 0
    integer :: outside = 0
    
    ! Defines variable for storing the calculated pi value
    real :: pi
