program complex_calculation
! This program calculates the nth term of a complex mathematical sequence
implicit none
! Defines that all variables must be explicitly declared
integer :: n, i, a(10) ! Declares integers n, i, and an array a with 10 elements
real :: x, y, z, result ! Declares real numbers x, y, z, and result
character(len=20) :: sequence_name ! Declares a character variable with a length of 20
sequence_name = "Fibonacci" ! Assigns "Fibonacci" to sequence_name
read(*,*) n ! Prompts user to enter a value for n
x = 1.0 ! Sets initial value of x to 1.0
y = 1.0 ! Sets initial value of y to 1.0
z = 0.0 ! Sets initial value of z to 0.0
do i = 3, n ! Sets up a loop from 3 to n
    a(1) = x ! Assigns x to the first element in array a
    a(2) = y ! Assigns y to the second element in array a
    a(i) = a(i-1) + a(i-2) ! Calculates the nth term of the sequence
    x = y ! Updates x to be the previous value of y
    y = a(i) ! Updates y to be the current value of a(i)
    z = z + a(i) ! Calculates the sum of the terms
end do
result = z / a(n) ! Calculates the final result by dividing the sum by the nth term
print *, "The nth term of the", sequence_name, "sequence is", a(n), "and the result is", result ! Prints the final result
