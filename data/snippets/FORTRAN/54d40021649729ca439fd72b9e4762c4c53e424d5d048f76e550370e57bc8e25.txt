program complex_numbers
! This program performs basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers

! Define variables
complex :: z1, z2, result

! Take input from user for first complex number
write(*,*) "Enter real part of first complex number:"
read(*,*) z1%re
write(*,*) "Enter imaginary part of first complex number:"
read(*,*) z1%im

! Take input from user for second complex number
write(*,*) "Enter real part of second complex number:"
read(*,*) z2%re
write(*,*) "Enter imaginary part of second complex number:"
read(*,*) z2%im

! Perform addition operation
result = z1 + z2

! Print the result
write(*,*) "Addition of complex numbers is: ", result%re, " + ", result%im, "i"

! Perform subtraction operation
result = z1 - z2

! Print the result
write(*,*) "Subtraction of complex numbers is: ", result%re, " + ", result%im, "i"

! Perform multiplication operation
result = z1 * z2

! Print the result
write(*,*) "Multiplication of complex numbers is: ", result%re, " + ", result%im, "i"

! Perform division operation
result = z1 / z2

! Print the result
write(*,*) "Division of complex numbers is: ", result%re, " + ", result%im, "i"
