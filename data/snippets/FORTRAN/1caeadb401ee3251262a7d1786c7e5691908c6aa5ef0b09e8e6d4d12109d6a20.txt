! This program performs a linear regression on a set of data
program linear_regression

! Declare variables
real, dimension(100) :: x, y, y_predicted, residuals
real :: sum_x, sum_y, sum_xy, sum_xx, slope, intercept
integer :: num_pts, i

! Initialize variables
sum_x = 0
sum_y = 0
sum_xy = 0
sum_xx = 0
num_pts = 100

! Read in data from file
open(10, file='data.txt', status='old', action='read')
do i = 1, num_pts
    read(10, *) x(i), y(i)
end do
close(10)

! Calculate sums for regression calculation
do i = 1, num_pts
    sum_x = sum_x + x(i)
    sum_y = sum_y + y(i)
    sum_xy = sum_xy + x(i) * y(i)
    sum_xx = sum_xx + x(i) * x(i)
end do

! Calculate slope and intercept for linear regression
slope = (num_pts * sum_xy - sum_x * sum_y) / (num_pts * sum_xx - sum_x * sum_x)
intercept = (sum_y - slope * sum_x) / num_pts

! Calculate predicted values and residuals
do i = 1, num_pts
    y_predicted(i) = slope * x(i) + intercept
    residuals(i) = y(i) - y_predicted(i)
end do

! Print out results
print *, "Slope:", slope
print *, "Intercept:", intercept
print *, "Residuals:", residuals
