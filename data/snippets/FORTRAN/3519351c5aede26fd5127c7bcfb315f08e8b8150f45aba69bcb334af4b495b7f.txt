! This program calculates the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method

program monte_carlo_pi

implicit none

integer :: num_points, num_in_circle, i ! declaring variables for storing number of points, number of points in circle and loop index
real :: rand_x, rand_y, pi_est ! declaring variables for storing random x and y coordinates and estimated value of pi

! prompt user for number of points
write(*,*) 'Enter the number of points: '
read(*,*) num_points

! initialize num_in_circle to 0
