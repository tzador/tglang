! This program calculates the average of a set of numbers
! Initialize variables
INTEGER :: num_elements ! variable to store the number of elements
REAL :: sum, average, number ! variables to store the sum, average and current number
INTEGER :: i ! loop index

! Prompt user for input
WRITE(*,*) "Enter the number of elements: "
READ(*,*) num_elements ! read the number of elements from user

! Initialize sum and loop index
sum = 0.0
i = 0

! Loop to get input and calculate sum
DO WHILE (i < num_elements)
    WRITE(*,*) "Enter number ", i+1, ": " ! prompt user for current number
    READ(*,*) number ! read current number

    sum = sum + number ! add current number to sum
    i = i + 1 ! increment loop index
END DO

! Calculate average
average = sum / num_elements

! Output the result
WRITE(*,*) "The average of the set of numbers is: ", average

! This is a comment line in FORTRAN that explains a portion of the code
