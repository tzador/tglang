PROGRAM complex_calculation

! Declaring variables
REAL :: x, y, z
INTEGER :: i, j, k, n
COMPLEX :: a, b, c

! Initializing variables
x = 2.5
y = 5.0
z = 1.5
i = 2
j = 3
k = 4
n = 8
a = CMPLX(2.0, 1.0) ! Creating a complex number with real and imaginary parts
b = CMPLX(3.5, 2.5)
c = 0.0+0.0i ! Initializing a complex number with real and complex parts to 0+0i

! Using DO loop to perform a series of calculations
DO i = 1, n     ! Iterating from 1 to n
    DO j = 1, k ! Iterating from 1 to k
        c = c + a * b * x * y / z ! Complex calculation using basic mathematical operators
    END DO
END DO

! Printing the result
PRINT *, "The final complex calculation result is:", c

END PROGRAM complex_calculation
