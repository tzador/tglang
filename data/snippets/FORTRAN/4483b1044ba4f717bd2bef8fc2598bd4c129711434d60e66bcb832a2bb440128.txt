PROGRAM COMPLEX_MATH
C This program calculates the addition and multiplication
C of two complex numbers and prints the result
      IMPLICIT NONE

C Define variables
      COMPLEX :: A, B, C
      REAL :: REAL_PART, IMAG_PART
      CHARACTER :: OPERATOR

C Prompt user for input
      WRITE(*,*) 'Please enter two complex numbers in the form (a,b): '
      READ(*,*) A, B

C Determine operator (+ or *) and perform appropriate operation
      WRITE(*,*) 'What operation do you want to perform? Enter + or *: '
      READ(*,*) OPERATOR

      IF (OPERATOR == '+') THEN    ! addition
            C = A + B
      ELSEIF (OPERATOR == '*') THEN    ! multiplication
            C = A * B
      END IF

C Split complex number into real and imaginary parts and print result
      REAL_PART = REAL(C)
      IMAG_PART = AIMAG(C)

      IF (IMAG_PART > 0) THEN
            WRITE(*,*) 'The result is: ', REAL_PART, ' + ', IMAG_PART, 'i'
      ELSE IF (IMAG_PART == 0) THEN
            WRITE(*,*) 'The result is: ', REAL_PART
      ELSE
            WRITE(*,*) 'The result is: ', REAL_PART, ' - ', ABS(IMAG_PART), 'i'
      END IF
