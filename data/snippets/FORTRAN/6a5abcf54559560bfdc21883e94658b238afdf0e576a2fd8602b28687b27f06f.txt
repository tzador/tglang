! This program calculates the square root of an inputted number using the Babylonian method
implicit none

! Define variables
real :: num, guess, temp
integer :: i

! Get input from user
print *, "Enter a number: "
read *, num

! Use the input as the initial guess for the square root
guess = num

! Set a tolerance level for the error
temp = 0.00001

! Loop through the calculation 10 times
do i = 1, 10
    ! Use the Babylonian method to improve the guess
    guess = (guess + num / guess) / 2.0
    
    ! Check if the error is within the tolerance level
    if (abs(guess*guess - num) < temp) then
        ! Exit the loop if the error is small enough
        exit
    end if
end do

! Print the result to the console
print *, "The square root of ", num, " is ", guess

end
