PROGRAM hypotenuse
  ! This program calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
  ! The user inputs the lengths of the two sides, and the program calculates the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.

  IMPLICIT NONE  ! Ensures no implicit typing is used.
  
  REAL :: side1, side2, hypotenuse  ! Declare input and output variables as real numbers.
  
  ! Prompt user for input and read in the lengths of the two sides.
  WRITE(*, '(A)', ADVANCE='NO') "Please input the length of side 1: "
  READ(*, *) side1
  WRITE(*, '(A)', ADVANCE='NO') "Please input the length of side 2: "
  READ(*, *) side2
  
  ! Calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.
  hypotenuse = SQRT(side1**2 + side2**2)
  
  ! Print the results.
  WRITE(*, *) "The length of the hypotenuse is ", hypotenuse
