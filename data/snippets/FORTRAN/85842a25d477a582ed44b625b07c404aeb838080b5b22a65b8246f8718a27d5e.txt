!This code calculates the average of an array of numbers
integer, parameter :: size = 10            !defines the size of the array
real :: array(size)                       !creates the array of real numbers
real :: total = 0                         !variable to hold the total sum of numbers
real :: avg                               !variable to hold the average
integer :: i                              !loop counter

!initialize array with random numbers
do i = 1, size
    call random_number(array(i))          !random_number is a subroutine that generates a random number between 0 and 1
    array(i) = array(i) * 100             !multiply by 100 to get larger range of numbers
end do

!calculate the total sum of numbers in the array
do i = 1, size
    total = total + array(i)
end do

!calculate the average by dividing the total sum by the size of the array
avg = total / size

!print the results to the screen
print *, "The average of the array is", avg
