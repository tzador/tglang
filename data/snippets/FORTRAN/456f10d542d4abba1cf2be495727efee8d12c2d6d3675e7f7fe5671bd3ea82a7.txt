! This program calculates the nth Fibonacci number
! Input the value of n
READ *, n
! Declare variables for storing the first two numbers of sequence
INTEGER :: first = 0
INTEGER :: second = 1
! Declare variables for storing the current and previous numbers in sequence
INTEGER :: current
INTEGER :: previous
! Loop from 2 until n
DO i = 2, n
    ! Calculate the current number by summing the previous two numbers
    current = first + second
    ! Update the previous numbers
    previous = first
    first = second
    second = current
END DO
! Print the nth Fibonacci number
WRITE (*, '(A, I0)') 'The nth Fibonacci number is ', current
