SUBROUTINE MAIN(X,Y)

! This is a FORTRAN subroutine that takes in two integer variables, X and Y
! and performs multiple operations on them.

INTEGER :: SUM, DIFF, PROD, QUOT

SUM = X + Y
DIFF = X - Y
PROD = X * Y
QUOT = X / Y  ! This is integer division, so any decimal places will be truncated

! Prints out the results of the operations
PRINT *, 'The sum of X and Y is ', SUM
PRINT *, 'The difference of X and Y is ', DIFF
PRINT *, 'The product of X and Y is ', PROD
PRINT *, 'The quotient of X and Y is ', QUOT
