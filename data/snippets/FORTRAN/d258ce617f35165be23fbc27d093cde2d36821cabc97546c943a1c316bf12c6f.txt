! This is a code snippet in FORTRAN that uses a DO loop to perform a complex mathematical calculation
! This DO loop will iterate through a set of values and perform the calculation for each value

! First, we initialize our variables and set the number of iterations for our DO loop
real :: x(10), y(10), z(10) ! declaring real variables for storing results
integer :: n = 10 ! setting the number of iterations to 10

! Next, we use the DO loop to iterate through the values of x and y
do i = 1, n
x(i) = 2.5 * i ! setting the value of x for current iteration
y(i) = 5.0 * i ! setting the value of y for current iteration
end do

! Now, we perform our complex mathematical calculation using the values of x and y
z = sin(x) * cos(y) + log(x) / y

! Finally, we print the results of our calculation
print *, "The results are:"
do i = 1, n
print *, "For x =", x(i), "and y =", y(i), "the value of z is", z(i)
end do
