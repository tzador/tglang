      INTEGER :: N, ROWS_A, COLS_A, ROWS_B, COLS_B, I, J, K
      REAL :: A(20,20), B(20,20), C(20,20), DET
C Comment: N is the size of the square matrices,
C ROWS_A and COLS_A are the number of rows and columns of matrix A, 
C ROWS_B and COLS_B are the number of rows and columns of matrix B,
C I, J, and K are loop variables for the matrix multiplication,
C A and B are the input matrices,
C C is the output matrix,
C DET is the determinant of the input matrix

C Retrieve input from user
      WRITE(*,*) 'Enter the size of the square matrices: '
      READ(*,*) N
C Determine the number of rows and columns for matrix A and B
      ROWS_A = N
      COLS_A = N
      ROWS_B = N
      COLS_B = N

C Populate matrix A with user input
      WRITE(*,*) 'Enter elements for matrix A: '
      DO I = 1, ROWS_A
            DO J = 1, COLS_A
                  READ(*,*) A(I,J)
            END DO

C Populate matrix B with user input
      WRITE(*,*) 'Enter elements for matrix B: '
      DO I = 1, ROWS_B
            DO J = 1, COLS_B
                  READ(*,*) B(I,J)

C Perform matrix multiplication
      DO I = 1, ROWS_A
            DO J = 1, COLS_B
                  C(I,J) = 0.0
                  DO K = 1, COLS_A
                        C(I,J) = C(I,J) + A(I,K) * B(K,J)
                  END DO
            END DO
      END DO

C Calculate the determinant of matrix A using the Gaussian Elimination method
      DO J = 1, COLS_A
            DO I = J+1, ROWS_A
                  DET = A(I,J) / A(J,J)
                  DO K = J, COLS_A
                        A(I,K) = A(I,K) - DET * A(J,K)
                  END DO
            END DO
      END DO

C Print the output matrix C
      WRITE(*,*) 'The result of the matrix multiplication is: '
      DO I = 1, ROWS_A
            DO J = 1, COLS_B
                  WRITE(*,*) C(I,J)
