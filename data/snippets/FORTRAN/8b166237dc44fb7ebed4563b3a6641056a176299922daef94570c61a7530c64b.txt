! Program to calculate the area of a circle
! User inputs the radius value
! Program outputs the area value

program circle_area
    implicit none
    real :: radius, area, pi
    ! Declaring variables for radius, area and pi (3.14159)

    write(*,*) "Enter the radius of the circle: "
    read(*,*) radius
    ! Prompt user to input radius value and read it in

    pi = 3.14159
    ! Assigning value of pi to variable pi

    area = pi * radius**2
    ! Calculating area of the circle using radius and pi

    write(*,*) "The area of the circle with radius ", radius, " is: ", area
    ! Outputting the calculated area value

end program circle_area
