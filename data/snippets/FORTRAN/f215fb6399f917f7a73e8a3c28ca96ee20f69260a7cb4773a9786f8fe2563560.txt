program factorial

  implicit none ! prevents implicit declaration of variables

  integer :: n, i, fact ! declaring integer variables n, i, and fact

  fact = 1 ! initialize fact to 1
  
  print *, "Enter a number: " ! prints message for user
  read *, n ! reads user input and assigns it to variable n

  do i = 1, n ! do loop for calculating factorial
      fact = fact * i ! calculates factorial and assigns it to variable fact
  end do

  print *, "Factorial of ", n, " is ", fact ! prints result
  ! e.g. Factorial of 5 is 120

end program factorial
