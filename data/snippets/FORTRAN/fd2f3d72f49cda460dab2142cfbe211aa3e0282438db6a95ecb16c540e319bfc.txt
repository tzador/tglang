! This program calculates the factorial of a number
program factorial

  implicit none    ! Prevents spelling errors in variable names

  integer :: num, fact, i ! Declare variables as integers

  write(*,*) 'Enter a positive integer:'    ! Prompts user to enter a number
  read(*,*) num    ! Reads the number into the variable 'num'

  fact = 1    ! Sets the initial value of 'fact' to 1

  do i = 1, num    ! Loop to calculate factorial
    fact = fact * i    ! Multiplies 'fact' by 'i' and stores the result in 'fact'
  end do

  write(*,*) 'The factorial of', num, ' is ', fact    ! Prints the result
end program factorial
