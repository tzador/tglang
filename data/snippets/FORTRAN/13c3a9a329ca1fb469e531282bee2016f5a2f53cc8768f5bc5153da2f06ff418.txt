PROGRAM complex_numbers
  ! This program performs basic operations with complex numbers
  IMPLICIT NONE
  
  REAL :: a, b, c, d, real_result, imag_result
  ! declare variables for real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers and the result
  
  PRINT*, "Enter the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number:"
  READ*, a, b ! prompt for and read in the real and imaginary parts of the first number
  
  PRINT*, "Enter the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number:"
  READ*, c, d ! prompt for and read in the real and imaginary parts of the second number
  
  ! perform addition of the two complex numbers
  real_result = a + c ! add the real parts
  imag_result = b + d ! add the imaginary parts
  
  PRINT*, "The sum of the two complex numbers is:"
  PRINT*, real_result, "+", imag_result, "i" ! output the sum in the form a + bi 
  
  ! perform subtraction of the two complex numbers
  real_result = a - c ! subtract the real parts
  imag_result = b - d ! subtract the imaginary parts
  
  PRINT*, "The difference between the two complex numbers is:"
  PRINT*, real_result, "+", imag_result, "i" ! output the difference in the form a + bi
  
  ! perform multiplication of the two complex numbers
  real_result = (a * c) - (b * d) ! multiply the real parts and subtract the product of the imaginary parts
  imag_result = (a * d) + (b * c) ! multiply the imaginary parts and add the product of the real parts
  
  PRINT*, "The product of the two complex numbers is:"
  PRINT*, real_result, "+", imag_result, "i" ! output the product in the form a + bi
  
  ! perform division of the two complex numbers
  real_result = (a * c + b * d) / (c**2 + d**2) ! divide the sum of the products of the real and imaginary parts by the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts
  imag_result = (b * c - a * d) / (c**2 + d**2) ! divide the difference of the products of the real and imaginary parts by the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts
  
  PRINT*, "The quotient of the two complex numbers is:"
  PRINT*, real_result, "+", imag_result, "i" ! output the quotient in the form a + bi
