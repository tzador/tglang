! This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
  ! Initialize variables
  INTEGER :: num, fact, i

  ! Get input from user
  PRINT *, "Enter a number:"
  READ *, num

  ! Perform factorial calculation
  fact = 1                        ! Initialize factorial variable to 1
  DO i = 1, num                   ! Loop from 1 to the given number
    fact = fact * i               ! Multiply factorial variable by loop index
  END DO                          ! End of loop

  ! Print result to user
  PRINT *, "Factorial of", num, "is", fact
