c This is a code snippet in FORTRAN
c It will generate the first 50 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence

program fibonacci
  implicit none

  integer :: n, i, num1, num2, result

  n = 50   ! defining the number of elements in the sequence

  num1 = 0   ! first element of the sequence
  num2 = 1   ! second element of the sequence

  do i = 1, n   ! loop through each element from 1 to n
    result = num1 + num2   ! calculate the next element in the sequence

    write(*,*) result   ! print the result to the console
    
    num1 = num2   ! set the second element as the first for the next iteration
    num2 = result   ! set the result as the second element for the next iteration
  end do

end program fibonacci
