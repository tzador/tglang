program fibonacci
! This program calculates and prints the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence

    implicit none
    integer :: n, i
    integer :: f(30) ! array to store the Fibonacci sequence up to 30 terms
    integer :: result

    print *, "Enter the value of n: "
    read *, n ! read user input for the desired term in Fibonacci sequence

    f(1) = 0 ! first term is 0
    f(2) = 1 ! second term is 1

! loop to calculate and store the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term
    do i = 3, n
        f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2)
    end do

    result = f(n) ! store the nth term in variable 'result'

! print the result
    print *, "The", n, "term in the Fibonacci sequence is:", result

end program fibonacci
