  ! This program performs basic operations on complex numbers
  
  ! Define variables for real and imaginary parts of the first complex number
  real :: a1, b1
  ! Define variables for real and imaginary parts of the second complex number
  real :: a2, b2
  ! Define variables for real and imaginary parts of the resulting complex number
  real :: a_result, b_result
  
  ! Prompt user to enter real and imaginary parts of the first complex number 
  write (*,*) 'Enter the real part of the first complex number:'
  read (*,*) a1
  write (*,*) 'Enter the imaginary part of the first complex number:'
  read (*,*) b1
  
  ! Prompt user to enter real and imaginary parts of the second complex number
  write (*,*) 'Enter the real part of the second complex number:'

  ! Perform addition between the two complex numbers
  a_result = a1 + a2

  ! Print the resulting complex number
  write (*,*) 'The sum of the two complex numbers is:'
  write (*,*) a_result, ' + ', b_result, 'i'
  
  ! Perform subtraction between the two complex numbers
