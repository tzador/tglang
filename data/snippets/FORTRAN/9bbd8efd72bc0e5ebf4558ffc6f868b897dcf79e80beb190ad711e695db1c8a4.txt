program financial_calculator
    ! This program calculates the future value of an investment

    implicit none
    real :: principal ! amount of initial investment 
    real :: annual_interest_rate ! annual interest rate in decimal form
    integer :: num_years ! number of years investment will be held
    integer :: i ! loop variable
    real :: future_value ! stores the calculated future value of the investment

    ! get inputs from user
    print*, "Enter the initial investment amount:"
    read*, principal
    print*, "Enter the annual interest rate (in decimal form):"
    read*, annual_interest_rate

    read*, num_years

    ! calculate future value using compound interest formula
    future_value = principal

        future_value = future_value * (1 + annual_interest_rate)
    end do
