c A program to calculate the Fibonacci series

program fibonacci
implicit none
integer :: n, i, a(100)

write(*,*) 'Enter the number of terms in the series:'
read(*,*) n  !read in the number of terms from user input

a(1) = 0  !first term in the series is 0
a(2) = 1  !second term in the series is 1

!loop to calculate and store the remaining terms
do i = 3, n
    a(i) = a(i-1) + a(i-2)  !calculate the next term by summing previous two terms
enddo

!output the Fibonacci series
write(*,*) 'Fibonacci series with ', n, ' terms:'
do i = 1, n
    write(*,*) a(i)  !output each term in the series
enddo

end program fibonacci
