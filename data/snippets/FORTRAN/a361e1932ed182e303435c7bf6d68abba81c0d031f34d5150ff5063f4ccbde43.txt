! This is a comment in FORTRAN
PROGRAM example
  IMPLICIT NONE ! This statement requires all variables to be explicitly defined

  INTEGER :: n ! Declaration of a variable n as an integer
  REAL :: x, y ! Declaration of variables x and y as real numbers
  n = 5 ! Assigning a value of 5 to the variable n
  
  ! DO loop to loop through values from 1 to n
  DO i = 1, n
    ! Generating a random number between 0 and 1 and storing it in variable x
    CALL RANDOM_NUMBER(x) 
    ! Calculating the square of x and storing it in variable y
    y = x ** 2 
    ! Printing the value of y
    PRINT *, "Square of x = ", y
  END DO
  STOP ! Stops the program
