PROGRAM complex_numbers
       ! This program performs basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers
       REAL :: a,b,c,d            ! declaring the real components of the first complex number
       REAL :: e,f,g,h            ! declaring the real components of the second complex number 
       REAL :: i,j,k,l            ! variables to store the results of arithmetic operations on complex numbers

       WRITE (*,*) "Enter the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number:"
       READ (*,*) a, b           ! reading in the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number

       WRITE (*,*) "Enter the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number:"
       READ (*,*) c, d           ! reading in the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number

       ! performing addition operation
       i = a + c                 ! adding real parts
       j = b + d                 ! adding imaginary parts

       ! performing subtraction operation
       k = a - c                 ! subtracting real parts
       l = b - d                 ! subtracting imaginary parts

       ! performing multiplication operation
       e = a*c - b*d             ! real part of the product
       f = a*d + b*c             ! imaginary part of the product

       ! performing division operation
       g = (a*c + b*d) / (c*c + d*d)    ! real part of the quotient
       h = (b*c - a*d) / (c*c + d*d)    ! imaginary part of the quotient
