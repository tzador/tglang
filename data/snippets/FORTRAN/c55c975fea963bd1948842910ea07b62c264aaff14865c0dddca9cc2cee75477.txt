PROGRAM example
 !This is a FORTRAN program that calculates the distance between two points.

 IMPLICIT NONE
 !This statement ensures that all variables are explicitly defined.

 REAL :: x1, y1, x2, y2
 !This statement defines four variables as single-precision floating point numbers.

 WRITE(*,*) "Enter the coordinates of point 1:"
 READ(*,*) x1, y1
 !This prompts the user to input the coordinates of point 1 and stores them in the variables x1 and y1.

 WRITE(*,*) "Enter the coordinates of point 2:"
 READ(*,*) x2, y2
 !This prompts the user to input the coordinates of point 2 and stores them in the variables x2 and y2.

 REAL :: distance
 distance = SQRT((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)
 !This calculates the distance between the two points using the distance formula.

 WRITE(*,*) "The distance between point 1 and point 2 is: ", distance
 !This prints the result to the screen.
