! This is the start of the program
! This program takes in user input and calculates the factorial of the given number

! Declare variables
INTEGER :: num, fact, i

! Prompt user for input
PRINT *, 'Enter a number:'
READ *, num

! Set initial value for factorial
fact = 1

! Loop to calculate factorial
DO i = 1, num
    fact = fact * i
END DO

! Print the result
PRINT *, 'Factorial of', num, 'is', fact

! End of program
