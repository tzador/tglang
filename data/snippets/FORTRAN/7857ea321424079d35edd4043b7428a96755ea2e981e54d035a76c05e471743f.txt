!Input the real part of first complex number
print *, "Enter the real part of the first complex number: "
read *, real_part1
!Input the imaginary part
print *, "Enter the imaginary part of the first complex number: "
read *, imaginary_part1
!Input the real part of second complex number
print *, "Enter the real part of the second complex number: "

!Calculating the sum
result_real = real_part1 + real_part2
