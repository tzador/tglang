! This is a program written in FORTRAN
! It performs a complex numerical calculation and prints the results

implicit none  ! Specifies that all variables must be explicitly declared
integer :: n, i, j ! Declare integer variables n, i, and j
real, dimension(5,5) :: A, B, C ! Declare 2D array variables A, B, and C of size 5x5
real :: alpha, beta  ! Declare real variables alpha and beta

! Initialize the values of arrays A and B
do i = 1, 5  ! Starting from index 1 until 5 (inclusive)
    do j = 1, 5  ! Starting from index 1 until 5 (inclusive)
        A(i,j) = i + j  ! Assign i+j as the value for element at index (i,j) in array A
        B(i,j) = i * j  ! Assign i*j as the value for element at index (i,j) in array B
    end do
end do

! Perform complex numerical calculation
do n = 1, 1000  ! Starting from index 1 until 1000 (inclusive)
    alpha = 0.0  ! Initialize alpha to 0
    do i = 1, 5  ! Starting from index 1 until 5 (inclusive)
        do j = 1, 5  ! Starting from index 1 until 5 (inclusive)
            alpha = alpha + A(i,j) / (i * j * n)  ! Update alpha by adding A(i,j) / (i*j*n)
        end do
    end do
    beta = 0.0  ! Initialize beta to 0
    do i = 1, 5  ! Starting from index 1 until 5 (inclusive)
        do j = 1, 5  ! Starting from index 1 until 5 (inclusive)
            beta = beta + B(i,j) / (i * j * n)  ! Update beta by adding B(i,j) / (i*j*n)
        end do
    end do

    ! Perform matrix multiplication between A and B and store the result in C
    do i = 1, 5  ! Starting from index 1 until 5 (inclusive)
        do j = 1, 5  ! Starting from index 1 until 5 (inclusive)
            C(i,j) = 0.0  ! Initialize element at index (i,j) of array C to 0
            do k = 1, 5  ! Starting from index 1 until 5 (inclusive)
                C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k) * B(k,j)  ! Update element at index (i,j) of array C
            end do
        end do
    end do
end do

! Print the results
print *, "The value of alpha is:", alpha  ! * indicates a list-directed output
print *, "The value of beta is:", beta
print *, "The resulting matrix C is:"
do i = 1, 5  ! Starting from index 1 until 5 (inclusive)
    do j = 1, 5  ! Starting from index 1 until 5 (inclusive)
