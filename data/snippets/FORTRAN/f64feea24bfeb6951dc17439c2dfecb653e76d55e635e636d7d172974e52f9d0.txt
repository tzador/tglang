! This is a program to calculate the factorial of a number
program factorial

   integer :: n, i, fact = 1 ! declare variables n, i and set fact to 1
   print*, "Enter a positive integer:"
   read*, n ! prompt user to enter an integer and read the value into n

   do i = 1, n ! do loop to iterate from 1 to n
      fact = fact * i ! calculate factorial
   end do

   print*, "Factorial of ", n, " is ", fact ! print the result to the console
end program factorial
