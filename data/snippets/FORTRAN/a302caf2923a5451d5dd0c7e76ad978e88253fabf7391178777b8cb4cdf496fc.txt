PROGRAM complex_numbers
! This program calculates the sum, difference, and product of two complex numbers
 
COMPLEX A, B, C
! declaring three complex variables

A = (3.0, 2.5)
B = (4.0, -1.5)
! assigning values to A and B

C = A + B 
! calculating the sum of complex numbers
 
PRINT *, "Sum of A and B is:", C
! printing the sum of A and B
 
C = A - B
! calculating the difference of complex numbers
 
PRINT *, "Difference of A and B is:", C
! printing the difference of A and B
 
C = A * B
! calculating the product of complex numbers
 
PRINT *, "Product of A and B is:", C
! printing the product of A and B
