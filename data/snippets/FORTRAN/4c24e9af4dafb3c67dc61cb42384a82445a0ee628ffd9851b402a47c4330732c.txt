! This program uses the DO loop to calculate the factorial of a number
program factorial

implicit none

integer :: n, i, fact = 1 ! declare integer variables n, i, and fact and initialize fact to 1

! prompt user for input
print *, "Enter a positive integer:"
read *, n ! read user input into variable n

! check if input is positive
if (n < 0) then
  print *, "Error: Input must be positive"
  stop ! stop program if input is negative
end if

! calculate factorial using DO loop
do i = 1, n ! DO loop from 1 to n, incrementing by 1 each time
  fact = fact * i ! multiply current value of fact by the index i
end do

! print output
print *, "Factorial of ", n, " is ", fact

end program factorial
