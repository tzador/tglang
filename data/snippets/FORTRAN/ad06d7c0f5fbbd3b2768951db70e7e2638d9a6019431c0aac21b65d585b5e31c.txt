! This is a complex code snippet in FORTRAN

Program fibonacci ! Declaring program

    Implicit none ! Declaring implicit variable types

    Integer :: n, i ! Declaring integer variables "n" and "i"
    Integer, Dimension(:), Allocatable :: fib ! Declaring an allocatable integer array "fib"

    ! Prompting user for input
    Write(*,*) 'Enter the number of terms in the fibonacci sequence:'
    Read(*,*) n ! Reading user input and storing in "n"

    If (n<1) Then   ! Checking for invalid input
        Write(*,*) 'Please enter a positive integer value for n.'
        Stop   ! Stopping program
    End If

    Allocate(fib(n)) ! Dynamically allocating "n" number of elements for "fib" array

    ! Initializing first two elements of the sequence to 0 and 1
    fib(1) = 0
    fib(2) = 1

    ! Loop to calculate fibonacci sequence
    Do i = 3, n 
        fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2) ! Formula to calculate fibonacci sequence
    End Do

    ! Printing the sequence
    Write(*,*) 'The fibonacci sequence with', n, 'terms is:'
    Write(*,*) fib(1:n) ! Printing elements of "fib" array from 1st to "n"th term

End Program fibonacci ! Ending program
