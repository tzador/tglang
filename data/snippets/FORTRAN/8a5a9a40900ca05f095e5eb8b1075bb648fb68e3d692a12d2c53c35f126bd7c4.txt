c This is a sample code snippet in FORTRAN
      program main
      integer :: n = 10, i, total

      do i = 1, n  ! Loop through numbers from 1 to 10
          if (mod(i, 2) == 0) then  ! Check if number is even
              total = total + i  ! Add even numbers to total
          endif
      enddo

      write(*, *) "The sum of even numbers from 1 to 10:", total
      end
