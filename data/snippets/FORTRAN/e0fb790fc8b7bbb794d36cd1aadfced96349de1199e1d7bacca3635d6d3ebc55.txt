!This program calculates the value of Euler's constant using Simpson's rule

program euler

implicit none !declaring variables to be explicitly declared

!declaring variables
real :: a, b, h, c, s, g, e
integer :: n, i

c = 0.0 !initializing c to 0.0
a = 0.0 !initializing a to 0.0
b = log(10.0) !defining upper limit of integration as natural log of 10

read(*,*) n !reading in value for number of intervals from user
h = (b-a)/n !calculating interval length

s = func(a) + func(b) !calculating first and last terms in Simpson's rule

!loop to calculate sum of middle terms in Simpson's rule
do i = 1, n-1
    c = a + i*h !calculating x values for each interval
    s = s + 2*func(a+(i-0.5)*h) !adding middle terms to sum
end do

g = s*h/6.0 !final value of Simpson's rule

e = 1/g !calculating Euler's constant

print *, e !printing value of Euler's constant

contains !defining function to be used in Simpson's rule

        real :: x
        
        func = exp(x)/x !defining function to be integrated
