! This program calculates the total resistance of a circuit
! We will be using Ohm's Law to determine the resistance
! Define variables for voltage and current
real :: voltage, current
! Define an array for the resistances of the circuit
real, dimension(5) :: resistances
! Define a variable for the total resistance
real :: total_resistance
! Prompt the user to enter the voltage
print *, "Please enter the voltage (in volts) of the circuit:"
read *, voltage
! Prompt the user to enter the current
print *, "Please enter the current (in amperes) of the circuit:"
read *, current
! Prompt the user to enter the resistances
print *, "Please enter the resistances (in ohms) of the circuit:"
! Use a DO loop to read in the resistances and calculate the total resistance
do i = 1, 5
    read *, resistances(i)
    total_resistance = total_resistance + resistances(i)
end do
! Calculate the total resistance using Ohm's Law (V = I*R)
total_resistance = voltage/current
! Print the total resistance to the screen with a message
print *, "The total resistance of the circuit is ", total_resistance, " ohms."
