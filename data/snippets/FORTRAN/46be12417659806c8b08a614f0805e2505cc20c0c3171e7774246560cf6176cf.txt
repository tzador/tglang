PROGRAM polynomial
! This program calculates values for a polynomial function
! using the Horner's method of calculating polynomials.
! The polynomial is of the form a_n * x^n + a_(n-1) * x^(n-1) + ... + a_1 * x + a_0.
! Inputs:
!   coeffs - an array of coefficients, in order from highest degree to lowest degree
!   n - the degree of the polynomial
!   x - the value at which the polynomial is to be calculated
! Outputs:
!   result - the value of the polynomial at x
! Declare variables:
IMPLICIT NONE
INTEGER :: n, i ! variables used for looping
REAL :: x ! input value
REAL, DIMENSION(:), ALLOCATABLE :: coeffs ! input coefficients array
REAL :: result ! output value

! User inputs degree of polynomial:
WRITE(*,*) 'Enter the degree of polynomial:'
READ(*,*) n

! Allocate space for coefficients array:
ALLOCATE(coeffs(n+1))

! User inputs coefficients:
WRITE(*,*) 'Enter the coefficients, starting from highest degree:'
DO i = n, 0, -1
    READ(*,*) coeffs(i)
END DO

! User inputs value of x:
WRITE(*,*) 'Enter the value of x:'
READ(*,*) x

! Calculate value of polynomial using Horner's method:
result = coeffs(n+1)
DO i = n, 1, -1
    result = result * x + coeffs(i)
END DO

! Output result:
WRITE(*,*) 'The value of polynomial at x = ', x, ' is ', result

! Deallocate coefficients array:
DEALLOCATE(coeffs)
