  ! This program calculates the first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence using FORTRAN
  
  ! Variable declarations 
  integer :: i, n ! integer variables for looping and sequence
  integer, dimension(20) :: fibonacci ! integer array to store sequence
  
  ! Set initial values 
  fibonacci(1) = 0 ! first term in sequence
  fibonacci(2) = 1 ! second term in sequence
  
  ! Loop to calculate remaining terms
  do i = 3, 20 ! loop from third term to twentieth term
    fibonacci(i) = fibonacci(i-1) + fibonacci(i-2) ! calculate Fibonacci sequence using previous two terms
  end do
  
  ! Print sequence
  write(*,*) 'First 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence:'
  do i = 1, 20 ! loop through all terms
    write(*,*) fibonacci(i) ! print term
