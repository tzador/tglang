! Declaration of variables
integer :: i, n ! Define integer variables i and n
real :: pi, radius, area ! Define real variables pi, radius, and area 

! Prompt user for input
print *, "Enter the number of circles: "
read *, n ! Read in user input and store in variable n

! Initialize variables
pi = 3.141592653589793 ! Define the value of pi
i = 1 ! Set i to 1 to start the loop

! Start do loop
do while (i <= n) ! Loop will continue as long as i is less than or equal to n
    print *, "Enter the radius of circle", i, ": " ! Prompt user for radius of current circle
    read *, radius ! Read in user input and store in variable radius
    area = pi * radius**2 ! Calculate the area of the circle using the formula pi*r^2
    print *, "The area of circle", i, "is", area ! Print the area of the current circle
    i = i+1 ! Increment i by 1 to move on to the next circle
end do ! End do loop
