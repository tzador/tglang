Program: Newton-Raphson Method
  ! This program implements the Newton-Raphson method for finding the roots of a non-linear equation
  Implicit None
  Integer :: i, n
  Real :: x0, x1, fx, dfx, tolerance
  Real, Dimension(100) :: x, f, df
  Real, Parameter :: PI = 3.141593

  ! Number of iterations and initial guess
  n = 10
  x0 = 1.0
  
  ! Function and derivative declarations
  fx(x) = x**2 + 2.0*x + PI
  dfx(x) = 2.0*x + 2.0
  
  ! Loop over iterations
  Do i = 1, n
    ! Calculate function and derivative at current guess

    ! Calculate next guess using Newton-Raphson formula
    x1 = x0 - f(i)/df(i)
    
    ! Check for convergence
