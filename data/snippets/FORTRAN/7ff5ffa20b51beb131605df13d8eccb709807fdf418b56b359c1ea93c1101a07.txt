! This program solves the system of linear equations AX=B
! where A is a square matrix and B is a vector
! Input the size of the matrix N
READ*, N
! Declare the matrix A with size N*N
DIMENSION A(N,N)
! Declare the vector B with size N
DIMENSION B(N)
! Declare the solution vector X with size N
DIMENSION X(N)
! Input the elements of matrix A row by row
DO I = 1, N
    READ*, (A(I,J), J = 1, N)
END DO
! Input the elements of vector B
DO I = 1, N
    READ*, B(I)
END DO
! Solving the linear system using Gaussian elimination method
! Forward elimination
DO K = 1, N-1 ! outer loop for each column
    DO I = K+1, N ! inner loop for each row
        R = A(I,K)/A(K,K) ! ratio to eliminate the first element in the row
        DO J = K+1, N ! loop for each element in the row
            A(I,J) = A(I,J) - R*A(K,J) ! performing row operation
        END DO
        B(I) = B(I) - R*B(K) ! update the corresponding element in vector B
    END DO
END DO
! Backward substitution
DO I = N, 1, -1 ! loop for each row starting from the last row
    SUM = 0.0
    DO J = I+1, N ! loop for each element in the row
        SUM = SUM + A(I,J)*X(J) ! calculating the sum of products
    END DO
