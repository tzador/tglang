! Define an integer variable with initial value of 5
integer :: i = 5
! Define two real variables with initial values
real :: a = 3.14, b = 2.71
! Define a character variable with a maximum length of 10
character(len=10) :: str
! Define an array with 4 elements
real, dimension(4) :: arr
! Assign values to the array
arr = (/2.5, 1.8, 6.2, 4.3/)

! Use a DO loop to perform operations using the defined variables and array
do i = 1, 4
    ! Add the values of a, b, and the i'th element of the array and store it in a new variable
    real :: result = a + b + arr(i)
    ! Print the result
    print *, "Result", i, ":", result
end do

! Use a FORALL loop to perform vector operations on the array
forall(i = 1:4)
    ! Multiply the element of the array by 2
    arr(i) = arr(i) * 2
end forall

! Use a SELECT CASE statement to print different messages based on the value of the integer variable
select case(i)
    case(1)
        print *, "i is equal to 1"
    case(2)
        print *, "i is equal to 2"
    case default
        print *, "i is not equal to 1 or 2"
end select

! Use nested DO loops to perform matrix operations on a 3x3 array
real, dimension(3,3) :: matrix
do i = 1, 3
    do j = 1, 3
        ! Multiply the i'th row of matrix by the j'th column of matrix and store it in a new variable
        real :: product = matrix(i,:) * matrix(:,j)
        ! Print the result
        print *, "Product of row", i, "and column", j, ":", product
    end do
end do

! Use a DO WHILE loop to perform operations until a condition is met
real :: x = 5.0
do while(x > 0.0)
    ! Divide x by 2 and update its value
    x = x / 2
    ! Print the updated value
    print *, "x is currently:", x
end do
