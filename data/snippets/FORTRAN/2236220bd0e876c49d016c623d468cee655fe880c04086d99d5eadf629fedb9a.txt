! This is a subroutine in FORTRAN which calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
subroutine fibonacci(n)
    ! Define variables
    integer :: i, n, a, b, c
    ! Initialize variables
    a = 0
    b = 1
    ! Print first two terms of Fibonacci sequence
    print *, "The first term of the Fibonacci sequence is ", a, "."
    print *, "The second term of the Fibonacci sequence is ", b, "."
    ! Loop through the remaining terms
    do i = 3, n
        ! Calculate next term in sequence
        c = a + b
        ! Update variables
        a = b
        b = c
        ! Print current term in sequence
        print *, "The ", i, "th term of the Fibonacci sequence is ", c, "."
    end do
end subroutine fibonacci
