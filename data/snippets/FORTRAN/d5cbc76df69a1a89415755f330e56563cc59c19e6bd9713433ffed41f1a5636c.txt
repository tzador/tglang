PROGRAM ComplexCalculation    ! This is a program called ComplexCalculation
IMPLICIT NONE                  ! Forces all variable declarations to be explicit
REAL :: complex_num1, complex_num2 ! Declares two real variables to hold complex numbers
COMPLEX :: result ! Declares a complex variable to hold the result of the calculation
complex_num1 = 2.5 + 3.2j ! Assigns a value to complex_num1
complex_num2 = 1.3 - 2.7j ! Assigns a value to complex_num2
! Calculates the complex conjugate of complex_num1 and stores it in result
result = CONJG(complex_num1)
! Adds complex_num2 to result and stores the result in result
result = result + complex_num2
! Prints the values of complex_num1, complex_num2, and result
PRINT *, 'The first complex number is', complex_num1
PRINT *, 'The second complex number is', complex_num2
PRINT *, 'The result is', result
