program fib

  ! This program calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence

  implicit none

  ! Declare variables
  integer :: n, first = 0, second = 1, next

  ! Get input from user
  print *, "Enter a positive integer:"
  read *, n

  ! Loop to iterate through fibonacci sequence
  do while (n < 0)

    ! Print error message if input is negative
    print *, "Error: Please enter a positive integer"
    print *, "Enter a positive integer:"
    read *, n

  end do

  ! Calculate nth number in fibonacci sequence
  if (n == 1) then

    ! Output first number in sequence if n = 1
    print *, "0"

  else if (n == 2) then

    ! Output second number in sequence if n = 2
    print *, "1"

  else

    ! Loop to calculate nth number in sequence
    do i = 3, n

      ! Calculate next number in sequence
      next = first + second

      ! Shift numbers in sequence
      first = second
      second = next

    end do

    ! Output nth number in sequence
    print *, next

  end if
