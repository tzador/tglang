! This is a program that calculates the sum of two numbers 
program add_numbers

  ! We declare two integer variables
  integer :: num1, num2
  
  ! We prompt the user to enter the two numbers
  print *, "Enter the first number:"
  read *, num1
  print *, "Enter the second number:"
  read *, num2
  
  ! We calculate the sum and store it in a variable
  integer :: sum
  sum = num1 + num2
  
  ! We display the result to the user
  print *, "The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", sum
