PROGRAM CALCULATE_DERIVATIVES

      ! This program calculates the first and second
      ! derivatives of a given mathematical function

      IMPLICIT NONE

      REAL :: x, h, f, df, d2f

      ! Input the value of x and the step size h
      READ *, x, h

      ! Calculate the value of the function at x
      f = 2*x**3 + 4*x**2 + 5*x + 6

      ! Calculate the first derivative (df)
      ! Using the two-point numerical differentiation
      df = (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h

      ! Calculate the second derivative (d2f)
      ! Using the three-point numerical differentiation
      d2f = (f(x+h) - 2*f(x) + f(x-h)) / h**2

      ! Print the values of f, df, and d2f
      PRINT *, "The value of the function at x =", x
      PRINT *, "The value of the first derivative =", df
      PRINT *, "The value of the second derivative =", d2f
