PROGRAM polynomial

  ! This program calculates the value of a polynomial
  ! for given x and coefficients.

  IMPLICIT NONE

  INTEGER :: n, i ! declare variables
  REAL :: x, p, c(10) ! declare arrays

  ! Accept input from user
  PRINT*, 'Enter the degree of the polynomial: '
  READ*, n

  PRINT*, 'Enter the value of x: '
  READ*, x

  PRINT*, 'Enter the coefficients of the polynomial: '

  ! Loop through array to accept coefficients
  DO i = 0, n
    PRINT*, 'Enter coefficient number', i
    READ*, c(i)
  END DO

  ! Calculate the value of the polynomial
  p = c(n) ! set p equal to the last coefficient
  DO i = n-1, 0, -1 ! loop through the coefficients in reverse order
    p = p*x + c(i) ! calculate the polynomial value for each term
  END DO

  PRINT*, 'The value of the polynomial for x = ', x, 'is', p
