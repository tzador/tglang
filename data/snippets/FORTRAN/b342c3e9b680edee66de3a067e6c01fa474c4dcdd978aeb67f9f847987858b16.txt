! This is a commented FORTRAN code snippet
! It calculates the value of pi using the Leibniz formula

program pi_calculation
    implicit none        ! Declares all variables explicitly
    
    real :: pi           ! Declares pi as a real number
    integer :: i         ! Declares integer i for loop iteration
    real :: term         ! Holds the value of each term in the series
    real :: pi_approx    ! Holds the approximate value of pi
    
    pi = 0.0             ! Initializes the value of pi to 0
    
    do i = 0, 1000000, 1 ! Loop for 1 million iterations
        term = (-1.0)**i / (2.0*float(i) + 1.0) ! Calculates the current term in the series
        pi = pi + term    ! Updates the value of pi by adding the current term
    end do
    
    pi_approx = 4.0*pi   ! Multiplies the result by 4 to approximate pi
    
    print *, "The value of pi is: ", pi_approx  ! Prints the final result
    
end program pi_calculation  ! End of program
