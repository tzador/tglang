PROGRAM complex_calculator
! This program will calculate the result of a complex mathematical function using user input
! Define variables to store input and output values
COMPLEX :: x, y ! x and y are complex numbers
COMPLEX :: result ! result will store the output of the complex function
INTEGER :: n ! n will store the user's choice of function to perform
! Print instructions for user
PRINT *, "Welcome to the Complex Calculator!"
PRINT *, "Please enter a complex number for x:"
ACCEPT x
PRINT *, "Please enter a complex number for y:"
ACCEPT y
! Ask user for choice of function
PRINT *, "Select a function to perform:"
PRINT *, "1. Addition"
PRINT *, "2. Multiplication"
PRINT *, "3. Subtraction"
PRINT *, "4. Division"
ACCEPT n
! Perform the function based on user's choice
SELECT CASE (n)
  CASE (1) ! Addition
    result = x + y ! Use "+" operator for complex addition
    PRINT *, "The result of x + y is:", result
  CASE (2) ! Multiplication
    result = x * y ! Use "*" operator for complex multiplication
    PRINT *, "The result of x * y is:", result
  CASE (3) ! Subtraction
    result = x - y ! Use "-" operator for complex subtraction
    PRINT *, "The result of x - y is:", result
  CASE (4) ! Division
    result = x / y ! Use "/" operator for complex division
    PRINT *, "The result of x / y is:", result
  CASE DEFAULT ! If user's input is not a valid choice
    PRINT *, "Invalid input. Please select a valid function."
END SELECT
