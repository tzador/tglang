PROGRAM CircleArea

! This program calculates the area of a circle with a given radius.

REAL :: r, area          ! Declaring variables as REAL type
INTEGER :: n             ! Declaring a variable as INTEGER type

WRITE(*,*) "Enter the radius of the circle:"   ! Prompting user for input
READ(*,*) r                                    ! Reading input and storing in r

area = 3.14159 * r**2    ! Calculating the area of the circle using the formula A = Ï€r^2

n = area                 ! Converting the area to an integer by assigning it to variable n

WRITE(*,*) "The area of the circle is:", n     ! Displaying the result to the user
