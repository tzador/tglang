! This code snippet calculates the roots of a quadratic equation
program quadratic
    implicit none

    ! Declare variables
    real :: a, b, c, delta, x1, x2

    ! Ask for user input
    print*, "Enter the value of a, b, and c: "
    read*, a, b, c

    ! Calculate delta
    delta = b**2 - 4*a*c

    ! Check for imaginary roots
    if ( delta < 0 ) then
        print*, "This equation has imaginary roots."
        stop
    end if

    ! Calculate the roots
    x1 = (-b + sqrt(delta)) / (2*a)
    x2 = (-b - sqrt(delta)) / (2*a)

    ! Print the results
    print*, "The roots of the equation are: "
    print*, "x1 = ", x1
    print*, "x2 = ", x2

end program quadratic
