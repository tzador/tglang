program matrix_multiplication
! This program calculates the product of two matrices.
! Matrices A and B must have compatible dimensions (nxm and mxp respectively)

! Define variables for matrix dimensions
integer :: n, m, p

! Declare arrays for matrices A and B
real, dimension(n,m) :: A
real, dimension(m,p) :: B

! Declare array for matrix C, the product matrix
real, dimension(n,p) :: C

! Get input from user for matrix dimensions
print *, "Enter the number of rows in Matrix A: "
read *, n
print *, "Enter the number of columns in Matrix A and rows in Matrix B: "
read *, m
print *, "Enter the number of columns in Matrix B: "
read *, p

! Get input from user for matrix elements
print *, "Enter the elements of Matrix A: "
do i = 1, n
    do j = 1, m
        read *, A(i,j)
    end do
end do

print *, "Enter the elements of Matrix B: "
do i = 1, m
    do j = 1, p
        read *, B(i,j)
    end do
end do

! Calculate the product matrix C
do i = 1, n
    do j = 1, p
        C(i,j) = 0.0 ! Initialize element in C to 0
        do k = 1, m
            C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k) * B(k,j) ! Perform matrix multiplication
        end do
    end do
end do

! Print the product matrix C
print *, "The product of Matrix A and Matrix B is: "
do i = 1, n
    do j = 1, p
        print *, C(i,j)
    end do
end do
