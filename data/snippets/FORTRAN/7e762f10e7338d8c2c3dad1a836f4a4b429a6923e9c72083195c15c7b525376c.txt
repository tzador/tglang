program complex_multiply
    ! This program multiplies two complex numbers and prints the result
    real, dimension(2) :: complex_num1, complex_num2, result
    ! Declare three variables, two for the complex numbers and one for the result
    ! "real" is used to declare floating point variables
    ! "dimension(2)" declares an array of size 2, representing the real and imaginary parts
    ! of the complex numbers

    complex_num1 = [2.0, 3.0]
    complex_num2 = [4.0, -5.0]
    ! Assign values to the complex numbers

    result = [0.0, 0.0]
    ! Initialize the result with values

    do i = 1, 2
        ! Loop through the two elements of the complex numbers (real and imaginary parts)
        result(i) = result(i) + complex_num1(i) * complex_num2(i)
        ! Multiply the corresponding elements and add them to the result
    end do

    print *, "The result of the complex multiplication is: ", result
    ! Print the result to the console
