program complex_numbers
! This program performs operations with complex numbers.
implicit none
! Declare variables
complex :: z1    ! First complex number
complex :: z2    ! Second complex number
complex :: sum, difference, product  ! Output variables
real :: r1, r2, theta1, theta2   ! Real and angle components of input numbers
! Prompt user for input
print *, "Enter first complex number (in the form r, theta):"
read *, r1, theta1
print *, "Enter second complex number (in the form r, theta):"
read *, r2, theta2
! Convert to complex numbers
z1 = cmplx(r1, theta1, kind=cmplx(0.,1.))
z2 = cmplx(r2, theta2, kind=cmplx(0.,1.))
! Perform operations
sum = z1 + z2
difference = z1 - z2
product = z1 * z2
! Print results
print *, "Sum:", real(sum), "+", aimag(sum), "i"
print *, "Difference:", real(difference), "+", aimag(difference), "i"
print *, "Product:", real(product), "+", aimag(product), "i"
