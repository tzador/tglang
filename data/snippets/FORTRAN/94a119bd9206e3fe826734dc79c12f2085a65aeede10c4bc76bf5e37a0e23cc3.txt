  ! Define variables
  integer :: i, n

  n = 10000000     ! Number of terms in the series
  sum = 0.0_r      ! Initialize sum of terms to zero
  pi = 0.0_r       ! Initialize calculated value of pi
  
  ! Use do loop to iterate through series and calculate sum of terms
  do i = 0, n

  pi = 4.0_r * sum
  
  ! Print calculated value of pi
