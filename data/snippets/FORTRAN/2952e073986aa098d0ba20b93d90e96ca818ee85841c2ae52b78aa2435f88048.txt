!This code snippet calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers

PROGRAM sum_of_natural_numbers
    IMPLICIT NONE !Makes all variables declared explicitly
    INTEGER :: n, i !Declares integer variables
    REAL :: sum !Declares real variable
    sum = 0.0 !Initializes sum to 0.0
    WRITE(*,*) "Enter the value of n:" !Prompts user to enter the value of n
    READ(*,*) n !Reads in the value of n
    DO i = 1,n !Loop to calculate sum of first n natural numbers
        sum = sum + i !Adds i to sum
    END DO

    WRITE(*,*) "The sum of the first ", n, " natural numbers is ", sum !Prints the result
