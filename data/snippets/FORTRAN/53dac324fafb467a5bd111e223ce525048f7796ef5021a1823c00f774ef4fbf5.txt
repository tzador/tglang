C This program calculates the mean of three numbers
      PROGRAM MEAN
C Define variables for input
      REAL A, B, C, MEAN 
C Define variables for intermediate results
      REAL SUM, DIF, ABSUM 
      PRINT *, 'Enter three numbers:' 
      READ *, A, B, C
C Calculate sum and difference of first two numbers
      SUM = A + B 
      DIF = A - B 
C Calculate absolute value of the sum
      ABSUM = ABS(SUM) 
C Calculate mean of three numbers
      MEAN = (ABSUM + C)/(2.0) 
C Print mean to the screen 
      PRINT *, 'The mean of the three numbers is:', MEAN
