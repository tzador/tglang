PROGRAM QuadraticSolver
! This program solves a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.
! Variables to be input for equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0
    REAL :: a, b, c
! Variables to calculate delta and solution
    REAL :: delta, x1, x2

! Ask user for input of coefficients a, b, and c
    PRINT *, "Enter value for a: "
    READ *, a
    PRINT *, "Enter value for b: "
    READ *, b
    PRINT *, "Enter value for c: "
    READ *, c

! Calculate delta
    delta = (b**2) - (4*a*c)

! Check if equation has real solutions
    IF (delta < 0.0) THEN
        PRINT *, "Equation has no real solutions"
    ELSE
! Calculate first solution, x1
        x1 = (-b + SQRT(delta)) / (2*a)
! Calculate second solution, x2
        x2 = (-b - SQRT(delta)) / (2*a)
! Print results
        PRINT *, "The solutions are: "
        PRINT *, "x1 = ", x1
        PRINT *, "x2 = ", x2
    END IF
