PROGRAM extra_solar_planets
! This program calculates the number of extra-solar planets detected
! by dividing the total number of stars observed by the average number of planets per star
! Input data:
! num_stars - integer, number of stars observed
! num_planets - integer, total number of extra-solar planets detected
! avg_planets - real, average number of planets per star
! Output:
! n - real, estimated number of extra-solar planets

! Declare variables
INTEGER num_stars, num_planets
REAL avg_planets, n

! Get user input for num_stars and num_planets
WRITE (*,*) "Enter total number of stars observed:"
READ (*,*) num_stars
WRITE (*,*) "Enter total number of extra-solar planets detected:"
READ (*,*) num_planets

! Calculate average number of planets per star
avg_planets = REAL(num_planets) / REAL(num_stars)

! Print output message
WRITE (*,*) "The average number of planets per star is:", avg_planets

! Calculate estimated number of extra-solar planets
n = REAL(num_stars) / avg_planets

! Print final output
WRITE (*,*) "Based on this data, it is estimated that there are", n, "extra-solar planets."
