PROGRAM complex_math

! This program calculates the square root and natural logarithm of a complex number using FORTRAN's intrinsic functions.

! Variables:
COMPLEX :: z, sqrt_z, log_z
REAL :: real_part, imag_part

! User-defined complex number:
real_part = 2.5
imag_part = 1.3
z = (real_part,imag_part)

! Calculate square root using "SQRT" intrinsic function:
sqrt_z = SQRT(z)

! Calculate natural logarithm using "LOG" intrinsic function:
log_z = LOG(z)

! Print results:
PRINT *, "Complex number:", z
PRINT *, "Square root:", sqrt_z
PRINT *, "Natural logarithm:", log_z
