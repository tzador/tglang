!-- This program calculates the factorial of a given number using DO loop and user input in FORTRAN

!-- Initializing variables for user input and calculated factorial result
INTEGER :: num, factorial
!-- Prompting the user to enter a positive integer
PRINT *, "Enter a positive integer: "
!-- Accepting user input and assigning it to the variable num
READ *, num
!-- Checking if the input is a positive integer
IF (num <= 0) THEN
    !-- If the input is not positive, display error message and exit the program
    PRINT *, "Error: Input must be a positive integer"
    STOP
END IF
!-- Initializing the factorial result to 1
factorial = 1
!-- Looping through all numbers from 1 to the user input
DO i = 1, num
    !-- Multiplying the current factorial result by the current number
    factorial = factorial * i
END DO
!-- Displaying the final result
PRINT *, "Factorial of", num, "is", factorial
!-- End of program
