! This is a program to calculate the fibonacci sequence up to a given number

program fibonacci_sequence
    implicit none       ! Ensures all variables are declared
    integer :: n, l, m ! Declare variables for input and loop
    integer :: i, fib(100)  ! Declare variable for index and fibonacci numbers
    print *, "Enter the length of the sequence: " ! Prompt user for input
    read *, n ! Read user input for length of sequence
    fib(1) = 0  ! Initialize first fibonacci number as 0
    if (n > 1) then   ! Check if input is greater than 1
        fib(2) = 1  ! Initialize second fibonacci number as 1
        do i = 3, n    ! Loop from third to nth fibonacci number
            fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2) ! Calculate fibonacci number using previous 2 numbers
        end do
    end if
    print *, "The fibonacci sequence up to", n, "is:" ! Print out sequence
    do l = 1, n
        print *, fib(l)   ! Print each fibonacci number on a new line
    end do
