! Declaration of variables
REAL :: a, b, c
INTEGER :: i, j, k

! Get input from user
WRITE(*, *) "Enter a value for a:"
READ(*, *) a
WRITE(*, *) "Enter a value for b:"
READ(*, *) b
WRITE(*, *) "Enter a value for c:"
READ(*, *) c

! Print input values
WRITE(*, *) "a = ", a

! Nested loops for performing calculations
! The outer loop will iterate through the values of a
DO i = 1, a
    ! The middle loop will iterate through the values of b
    DO j = 1, b
        ! The inner loop will iterate through the values of c
        DO k = 1, c
            ! Perform calculations using the current values of a, b, and c
            a = a + (b * c)
            b = b - (c * a)
            c = c * (a - b)

            ! Print results after each iteration
            WRITE(*, *) "a = ", a
