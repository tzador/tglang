! This program calculates the average and standard deviation of a set of numbers

program stats !start of program

implicit none !declares that all variables must be explicitly defined

integer :: n !variable n to store number of elements in set
real :: sum, avg, std !variables to store sum, average, and standard deviation
real :: x(100) !array to store set of numbers, maximum size of 100

print*, 'Enter the number of elements in the set:' !prompts user for input
read*, n !reads user input and stores in n

print*, 'Enter the numbers in the set:' !prompts user to enter each number

do i = 1, n !loop to read and store each number in x array
    read*, x(i)
end do

!calculate sum of all numbers in set
sum = 0.0
do i = 1, n
    sum = sum + x(i)
end do

!calculate average by dividing sum by number of elements in set
avg = sum / n 

!calculate standard deviation
std = 0.0 !initializing std
do i = 1, n
    std = std + (x(i) - avg)**2 !summing squared differences between each number and the average
end do
std = sqrt(std / (n-1)) !divide by n-1 and take square root to get standard deviation

!print results
print*, 'Average:', avg
print*, 'Standard Deviation:', std
