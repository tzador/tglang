! This code snippet calculates the dot product of two vectors.

program dot_prod

integer :: N ! number of elements in the vectors
real*8 :: x(N), y(N) ! declaring two vectors of size N
real*8 :: dot ! variable to store the dot product
integer :: i ! loop counter

! initialize the vectors with random values
do i = 1, N
  x(i) = rand(0.0, 1.0) ! rand() generates a random number between 0 and 1
  y(i) = rand(0.0, 1.0)
end do

dot = 0.0 ! initialize dot product to 0

! calculate the dot product
do i = 1, N
  dot = dot + x(i)*y(i)
end do

! print the result
print *, 'Dot product of x and y is: ', dot

end program dot_prod
