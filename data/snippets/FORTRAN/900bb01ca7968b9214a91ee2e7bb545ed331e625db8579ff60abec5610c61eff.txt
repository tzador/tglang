! This is a program that calculates the average of a given array of numbers
! Declaration of variables
integer :: num, i ! num will hold the size of the array, i will be used for iteration
real :: avg, sum ! avg will store the average, sum will hold the sum of numbers

! Reading user input for number of elements in array
print*, "Enter the size of the array:"
read*, num

! Declaration of an array with size num
real, dimension(num) :: arr

! Reading user input for array elements
print*, "Enter the numbers:"
do i = 1, num
    read*, arr(i)
end do

! Loop to calculate sum of numbers in array
do i = 1, num
    sum = sum + arr(i)
end do

! Calculating average
avg = sum / num

! Outputting the average
print*, "The average of the array is:", avg

! End of program
end
