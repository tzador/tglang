! This code snippet is a recursive subroutine that calculates the factorial of a given number N
! The variable N is passed as an argument to the subroutine
! The output is the factorial of N

recursive subroutine factorial(N)
    ! Declare local variable result to store the factorial
    integer :: result
    
    ! Base case: If N is equal to 0, return a factorial of 1
    if (N == 0) then
        result = 1
    
    ! Recursive case: If N is greater than 1, calculate the factorial by calling the subroutine recursively
    else
        result = N * factorial(N - 1)
    end if
    
    ! Print the result
    print *, "The factorial of", N, "is", result
end subroutine factorial

! Initialize variable N with the desired number
integer :: N = 5

! Call the factorial subroutine with N as the argument
call factorial(N)

! Output:
! The factorial of 5 is 120
