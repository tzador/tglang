subroutine array_operations(input)
    ! This subroutine takes an input array and performs various operations on it.
    ! Input: input - a one-dimensional array of integers
    implicit none
    integer, dimension(:), intent(in) :: input ! declares input as a one-dimensional array of integers
    integer :: length, sum, product ! declares variables for length, sum, and product
    length = size(input) ! gets the length of the input array
    ! prints the length of the input array
    write(*,*) "The length of the input array is: ", length
    ! calculates the sum of all elements in the array
    do i = 1, length
        sum = sum + input(i)
    end do
    ! prints the sum of the array
    write(*,*) "The sum of the array is: ", sum
    ! calculates the product of all elements in the array
    product = 1
    do i = 1, length
        product = product * input(i)
    end do
    ! prints the product of the array
    write(*,*) "The product of the array is: ", product
    ! calculates the average of all elements in the array
    average = sum / length
    ! prints the average of the array
    write(*,*) "The average of the array is: ", average
    ! calculates the standard deviation of all elements in the array
    standard_deviation = 0.0
    do i = 1, length
        standard_deviation = standard_deviation + (input(i) - average)**2
    end do
    standard_deviation = sqrt(standard_deviation / length)
    ! prints the standard deviation of the array
    write(*,*) "The standard deviation of the array is: ", standard_deviation
