! This is a program that calculates the nth Fibonacci number
 
program fibonacci
 
    integer :: n, i, f1 = 0, f2 = 1, fib
 
    print *, "Enter the value of n: " ! asks the user for input
    read *, n ! reads the input and assigns it to 'n'
 
    if (n == 0) then ! if n is equal to 0, the output is 0
        fib = 0
    else if (n == 1) then ! if n is equal to 1, the output is 1
        fib = 1
    else ! for n values greater than 1
        do i = 2, n ! loop from 2 to n to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
            fib = f1 + f2 ! calculates the current Fibonacci number
            ! shifts the values of f1 and f2 to calculate the next Fibonacci number
            f1 = f2 
            f2 = fib
        end do
    end if
 
    print *, "The nth Fibonacci number is: ", fib ! prints the calculated output
