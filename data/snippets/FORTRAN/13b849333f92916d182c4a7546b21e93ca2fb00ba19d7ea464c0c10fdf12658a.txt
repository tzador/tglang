PROGRAM fibonacci_sequence

! This program calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the 20th term

IMPLICIT NONE  ! This makes all variables have to be explicitly defined

INTEGER, PARAMETER :: MAX_TERM = 20  ! The maximum number of terms to be calculated
INTEGER :: fibonacci(MAX_TERM)      ! Array to store the sequence
INTEGER :: i                        ! Loop counter for terms

! Assign values to first two terms of the sequence
fibonacci(1) = 0
fibonacci(2) = 1

! Loop through remaining terms
DO i = 3, MAX_TERM
    fibonacci(i) = fibonacci(i-1) + fibonacci(i-2)
END DO

! Print out the sequence
PRINT *, "The first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:"

DO i = 1, MAX_TERM
    PRINT *, fibonacci(i)
END DO
