! This is a FORTRAN code for computing the factorial of a number
implicit none                 ! specifies that all variables must be declared
integer :: num, i, factorial  ! initializes three integer variables
real :: result                ! initializes a real variable 

print*, "Enter a number: "
read*, num  ! reads input from user

factorial = 1  ! initial value of factorial
result = 1  ! initial value of result

do i = 1, num  ! loops from 1 to num
  factorial = factorial * i  ! calculates factorial by multiplying previous value with i
  result = result + 1 / factorial ! calculates result by adding 1/factorial to previous value
end do

print*, "Factorial of", num, "is", result  ! prints final result

end ! ends the program
