! This is a FORTRAN code snippet that will calculate the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

program fibonacci ! declare program name

implicit none ! ensure all variables are declared
integer :: n ! declare number of terms
integer :: i ! declare counter
integer, dimension(10) :: fib ! declare array to store sequence

print*, "Enter the number of terms:" ! prompt the user for input
read*, n ! read user input into variable n

fib(1) = 0 ! assign first term of sequence
fib(2) = 1 ! assign second term of sequence

! use a DO loop to calculate remaining terms
do i = 3, n
    fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2) ! calculate term by adding previous two terms
end do

! use a DO loop to print out the sequence
do i = 1, n
    print*, fib(i) ! print term at index i
end do

end program fibonacci ! end program
