! This is a comment, it tells the purpose of the code

PROGRAM calc_factorial
! This is the start of the program

IMPLICIT NONE
! This statement is to ensure all variables are declared explicitly

INTEGER :: n, i, factorial ! Declaring variables of integer type
factorial = 1
! Initializing the factorial variable to 1 for the loop

WRITE(*,*) "Enter the number you want to find the factorial of:"
READ(*,*) n
! Asks user to input the number and stores it in the variable n

IF (n < 0) THEN
    WRITE(*,*) "Factorial of negative numbers is undefined"
! Checks if the number entered is negative, and prints a warning if it is
ELSEIF (n == 0) THEN
    WRITE(*,*) "Factorial of 0 is 1"
! Checks if the number entered is 0, and prints the result if it is
ELSE
    DO i = 1, n
    ! This loop will run from 1 to n
        factorial = factorial * i
    ! Calculates the factorial of n by multiplying it with all the numbers from 1 to n
    ENDDO
    WRITE(*,*) "Factorial of", n, "is", factorial
! Prints the final result of the factorial calculation
ENDIF

END PROGRAM calc_factorial
! This marks the end of the program
