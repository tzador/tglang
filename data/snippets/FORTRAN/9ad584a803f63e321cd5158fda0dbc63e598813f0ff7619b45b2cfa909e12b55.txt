PROGRAM complex_multiply

! This program computes the product of two complex numbers

      COMPLEX*16 A, B, C 
! *16 specifies the double precision of the variables

      INTEGER I 

      A = (2.0, 3.0)
      B = (4.5, 6.7)

      C = CMPLX(0.0, 0.0) 
! This sets the initial value of C to be 0.0 + 0.0i

      DO I = 1, 2
! This loop will be executed twice, once for the real part and once for the imaginary part

         C = C + A(I) * B(I) 
! This multiplies the corresponding elements of A and B and adds it to the current value of C

      END DO 

      PRINT *, "The product of A and B is:", C 

      END
