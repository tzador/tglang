! This program calculates the sine of a user-inputted angle in degrees
PROGRAM sine_calculator
  
  IMPLICIT NONE

  REAL :: angle, radian, result
  INTEGER :: i, accuracy, factorial, power

  ! Ask user for input
  PRINT*, "Enter the angle (in degrees): "
  READ*, angle

  ! Convert angle to radians
  radian = angle * 3.14159 / 180.0

  ! Set initial values for result and accuracy
  result = radian
  accuracy = 6

  ! Calculate sine using Taylor series expansion
  DO i = 1, accuracy
    factorial = 1
    power = 1
    DO j = 1, 2*i+1
      factorial = factorial * j
      power = power * radian
    END DO
    ! Add current term to result
    result = result + (-1)**i * power / factorial
  END DO

  ! Print final result
  PRINT*, "The sine of ", angle, " degrees is ", result
