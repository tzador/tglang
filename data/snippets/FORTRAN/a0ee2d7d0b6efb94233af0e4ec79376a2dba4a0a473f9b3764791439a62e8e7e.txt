INTEGER :: x, y, z

! This program calculates the sum of squares of three numbers
! and prints the result.

! Prompt user for input
WRITE(*, *) "Enter the first number:"
READ(*, *) x
WRITE(*, *) "Enter the second number:"
READ(*, *) y
WRITE(*, *) "Enter the third number:"
READ(*, *) z

! Calculate squares of each number
x = x * x
y = y * y
z = z * z

! Calculate sum of squares
x = x + y + z

! Print result
WRITE(*, *) "The sum of squares is:", x
