! This is a program that calculates the factorial of a given number

program factorial

    ! Declare variables
    integer :: n, fact, i

    ! Prompt user to enter a number
    write(*,*) "Enter a number: "
    read(*,*) n

    ! Initialize factorial to 1
    fact = 1

    ! Use DO loop to calculate factorial
    do i = 1, n

        ! Multiply factorial by the current number
        fact = fact * i
        
        ! Print current number and factorial at each iteration
        write(*,*) "Current number: ", i, ", Factorial: ",fact

    end do

    ! Print final result
    write(*,*) "The factorial of ", n, " is ", fact

end program factorial
