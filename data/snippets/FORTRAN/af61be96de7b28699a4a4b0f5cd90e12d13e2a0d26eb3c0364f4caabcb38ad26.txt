! This is a code snippet in FORTRAN that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation
program quadratic_solver
implicit none
real :: a, b, c, disc, x1, x2

! Asking user for input values for the coefficients a, b, and c
write (*, *) 'Enter the values of a, b, and c: '
read (*, *) a, b, c

! Calculating the discriminant of the quadratic equation
disc = b**2 - 4*a*c

! Checking the value of the discriminant for different cases
if (disc < 0.0) then ! If the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex
    write (*, *) 'The equation has complex roots.'
else if (disc == 0.0) then ! If the discriminant is zero, the roots are equal
    write (*, *) 'The equation has equal roots.'
else ! If the discriminant is positive, the roots are real and distinct
    write (*, *) 'The equation has real and distinct roots.'
end if

! Calculating the roots using the quadratic formula
! If the discriminant is negative, the roots will be complex, so we use the complex sqrt function
! For real roots, we can use the regular sqrt function
x1 = (-b + sqrt(disc))/(2.0*a)
x2 = (-b - sqrt(disc))/(2.0*a)

! Printing the solutions to the quadratic equation
write (*, *) 'The roots of the equation are: ', x1, x2
