PROGRAM complex_numbers
! This program performs arithmetic operations on complex numbers.

    IMPLICIT NONE ! prevents implicit typing
    INTEGER :: real_part1, imaginary_part1, real_part2, imaginary_part2 ! declares integer variables
    COMPLEX :: complex1, complex2, result ! declares complex variables
    real_part1 = 5 ! sets real_part1 to 5
    imaginary_part1 = -3 ! sets imaginary_part1 to -3
    real_part2 = -2 ! sets real_part2 to -2
    imaginary_part2 = 7 ! sets imaginary_part2 to 7

! Using the CMPLX function to create complex numbers from variables
    complex1 = CMPLX(real_part1, imaginary_part1) ! creates a complex number with real_part1 and imaginary_part1
    complex2 = CMPLX(real_part2, imaginary_part2) ! creates a complex number with real_part2 and imaginary_part2

! Addition of two complex numbers using the "+" operator
    result = complex1 + complex2 ! adds complex1 and complex2 and stores the result in result

! Subtraction of two complex numbers using the "-" operator
    result = complex1 - complex2 ! subtracts complex2 from complex1 and stores the result in result

! Multiplication of two complex numbers using the "*" operator
    result = complex1 * complex2 ! multiplies complex1 and complex2 and stores the result in result

! Division of two complex numbers using the "/" operator
    result = complex1 / complex2 ! divides complex1 by complex2 and stores the result in result

! Printing the results
    WRITE(*,*) "Complex 1 has a value of", real(complex1), "+", imag(complex1), "i"
    WRITE(*,*) "Complex 2 has a value of", real(complex2), "+", imag(complex2), "i"
    WRITE(*,*) "Result has a value of", real(result), "+", imag(result), "i"
