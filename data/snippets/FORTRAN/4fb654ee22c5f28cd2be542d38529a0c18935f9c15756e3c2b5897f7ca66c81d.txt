! Compute the factorial of a given number
! Input: Number to compute factorial for
! Output: Factorial of input number

program factorial

! Declare program variables
integer :: num, fact, i

! User input
print*, "Enter a number:"
read*, num

! Initialize factorial variable to 1
fact = 1

! Loop to calculate factorial
do i = 1, num
    fact = fact * i
end do

! Print the result
print*, "The factorial of", num, "is", fact

end program factorial
