!This line is a comment indicating that we are using FORTRAN language
!In this code snippet, we will be calculating the area of a circle
!using the formula A = Ï€ * r^2, where A is the area and r is the radius

!Declaring variables radius and area
REAL :: radius, area

!Assigning a value to the radius variable
radius = 5.0

!Calculating the area of the circle
area = 3.14 * radius**2

!Printing the result
PRINT *, "The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", area

!Ending the program
END
