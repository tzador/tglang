PROGRAM fibonacci
	
	! This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence for the first n terms.
	
	! First, we ask the user for the number of terms to be calculated. 
	WRITE(*,*) 'Enter the number of terms to be calculated:'
	READ(*,*) n
	
	! Initialize the first two terms, f1 and f2, as 0 and 1 respectively.
	f1 = 0
	f2 = 1
	
	! We use a DO loop to iterate through each term of the sequence.
	DO i = 1, n
		
		! Calculate the next term in the sequence by adding the previous two terms.
		f3 = f1 + f2
		
		! Print the current term and its corresponding value.
		WRITE(*,*) 'Term', i, ': ', f3
		
		! Update the values of f1 and f2 for the next iteration.
		f1 = f2
		f2 = f3
	END DO
	
	! End the program.
