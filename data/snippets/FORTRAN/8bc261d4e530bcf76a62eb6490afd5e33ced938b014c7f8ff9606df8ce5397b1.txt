! This code segment calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

recursive subroutine factorial(n, result)
! This subroutine recursively calculates the factorial of a number n.
! The result is returned in the result variable.
! Parameters:
!   n: the number whose factorial is to be calculated.
!   result: the variable to store the result.

implicit none
integer :: n          	! input number
integer :: result     	! result variable
integer :: i = 1      	! loop counter variable
integer :: fact      	! variable to store current factorial value

if (n == 0) then 		! base case when n=0, factorial is 1
    result = 1
    return
else
    fact = 1 			! initialize fact to 1 for first iteration
    do while (i <= n) 	! loop until i becomes equal to n
        fact = fact * i 	! calculate factorial by multiplying with i
        i = i + 1 		! increment i
    end do
    result = fact 		! assign factorial value to result variable
    return
end if
