! This is a long and complex code snippet in FORTRAN

program complex_calculation
! This program performs a complex calculation using the bisection method

implicit none ! disables implicit variable declaration

! Define constants and variables
real :: a = 0.0 ! lower bound of the interval
real :: b = 10.0 ! upper bound of the interval
real :: c ! midpoint of the interval
real :: precision = 0.00001 ! desired precision for the bisection method
integer :: count = 0 ! counter to keep track of number of iterations
logical :: converged = .false. ! logical variable to check if the iteration has converged
real :: result ! final result of the calculation

! FUNCTION to be evaluated
real function func(x)
    real :: x
    func = x**2 - 2.0 ! f(x) = x^2 - 2
end function func

! MAIN PROGRAM
! Use a DO loop to perform the bisection method
do while (.not. converged)
    count = count + 1 ! increment the iteration counter
    c = (a + b) / 2.0 ! calculate the midpoint of the interval

    ! check if the function value at c is close enough to 0
    if (abs(func(c)) < precision) then
        converged = .true. ! iteration has converged
    else ! if the midpoint is not close enough, update the boundaries of the interval
        if (func(a) * func(c) < 0.0) then
            b = c
        else
            a = c
        end if
    end if
end do

! display the final result and number of iterations
result = c
print *, "Final result is: ", result
print *, "Number of iterations: ", count
