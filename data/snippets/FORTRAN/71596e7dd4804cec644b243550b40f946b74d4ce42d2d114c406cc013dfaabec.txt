! This program calculates the value of pi using the Leibniz formula
program pi_calculator

  implicit none ! explicit declaration of variables for cleaner code
  integer :: i, n ! counters for loop and number of iterations
  real*8 :: pi, prev_pi, tolerance ! variables for storing calculated pi, previous value of pi and tolerance

  n = 100000 ! number of iterations, can be changed as desired
  prev_pi = 0.0 ! initialize previous value of pi to 0
  tolerance = 1e-8 ! set tolerance to 0.00000001

  do while (abs(pi - prev_pi) > tolerance) ! loop until calculated pi is within tolerance of previous value
    prev_pi = pi ! assign previous pi to current calculated pi
    pi = 0.0 ! reset pi to 0 for each iteration
    do i = 1, n ! loop n times
      pi = pi + (-1)**(i+1) / (2.0*i - 1) ! Leibniz formula for pi
    end do
    pi = 4.0 * pi ! multiply by 4 to get actual value of pi
    n = n + 1000 ! increment n by 1000 for each iteration for higher precision
  end do
  
  write(*,*) 'Calculated value of pi = ', pi ! output calculated value of pi
  write(*,*) 'Number of iterations = ', n ! output the final number of iterations used
