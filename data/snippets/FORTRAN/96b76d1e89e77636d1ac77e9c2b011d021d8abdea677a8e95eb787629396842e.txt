! This code calculates the factorial of a given number
! by using nested DO loops

program factorial

! Declaration of variables
  integer :: num, fact, i, j

! Get input from user
  print *, "Enter a number:"
  read *, num

! Initialize fact to 1
  fact = 1

! Outer DO loop to iterate from 1 to num
  do i = 1, num

! Inner DO loop to multiply fact with numbers from 1 to i
    do j = 1, i
      fact = fact * j
    end do

! Output the factorial
  print *, "The factorial of", i, "is", fact

! Reset fact for next iteration
  fact = 1

  end do

end program factorial
