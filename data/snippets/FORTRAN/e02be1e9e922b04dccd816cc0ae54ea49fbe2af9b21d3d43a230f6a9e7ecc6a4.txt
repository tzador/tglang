program complex_numbers
    ! This program performs operations on complex numbers
    real :: x1, x2, y1, y2 ! declare real variables for the two complex numbers
    real :: result1, result2 ! declare real variables for the results of addition and multiplication
    complex :: z1, z2 ! declare complex variables for the two complex numbers

    ! prompt the user to enter the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number
    print*, 'Enter the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number:'
    read*, x1, y1

    ! prompt the user to enter the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number
    print*, 'Enter the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number:'
    read*, x2, y2

    ! create complex numbers using the real and imaginary parts
    z1 = (x1, y1)
    z2 = (x2, y2)

    ! perform addition of complex numbers and store the result in result1
    result1 = z1 + z2

    ! perform multiplication of complex numbers and store the result in result2
    result2 = z1 * z2

    ! print the results of addition and multiplication
    print*, 'The result of adding the two complex numbers is:', result1
    print*, 'The result of multiplying the two complex numbers is:', result2
