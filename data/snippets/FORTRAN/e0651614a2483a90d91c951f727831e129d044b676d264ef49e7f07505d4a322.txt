! This is a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop
program factorial_calculation

    integer :: n, i, factorial

    ! get input from user
    print *, "Enter a number:"

    ! check if input is valid
    if (n < 0) then

    ! loop to calculate factorial

    end do

    ! print result
    print *, "The factorial of", n, "is", factorial
