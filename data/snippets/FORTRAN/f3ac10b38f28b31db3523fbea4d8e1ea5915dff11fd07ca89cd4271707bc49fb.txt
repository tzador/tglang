  !This code snippet represents matrix multiplication using DO loops.
  !It multiplies matrix A and B, and stores the result in matrix C.

  !DO loop to iterate through rows of matrix A
  DO i = 1, n
    !DO loop to iterate through columns of matrix B
    DO j = 1, n
      !Initializing the element in matrix C to 0
      C(i, j) = 0
      !DO loop to iterate through columns of matrix A and rows of matrix B
      DO k = 1, n
        !Performing multiplication and addition to calculate result
        C(i, j) = C(i,j) + A(i, k) * B(k, j)
      END DO
    END DO
  END DO

  !Printing the result to the console
  PRINT *, "The result of matrix multiplication is:"
  DO i = 1, n
    DO j = 1, n
      PRINT *, C(i, j)
    END DO
