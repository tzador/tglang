program solve_equation
! Comments are marked with an exclamation point
implicit none
! Specifies that all variables must be explicitly declared
integer :: a, b, c   ! Declaring variables to hold coefficients of equation
real :: delta, x1, x2   ! Declaring variables to store results
! Setting initial values for coefficients
a = 1
b = 5
c = -6
! Calculating the discriminant
delta = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c
! Checking if equation has real solutions
if (delta < 0) then     
   ! If discriminant is negative, no real solutions exist
   print*, "This equation has no real solutions."
else
   ! If discriminant is non-negative, calculate solutions
   ! Calculating the first solution
   x1 = (-b + sqrt(delta)) / (2 * a)
   ! Calculating the second solution
   x2 = (-b - sqrt(delta)) / (2 * a)
   ! Outputting solutions
   print*, "The solutions are ", x1, " and ", x2
