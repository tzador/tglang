PROGRAM multiplication

  ! This program computes the product of two numbers entered by the user
  ! and prints the result

  IMPLICIT NONE  ! Ensures variables are declared before use

  INTEGER :: num1, num2      ! Declare variables as integers
  REAL    :: product         ! Declare variable as real number

  WRITE(*,*) "Enter first number: "   ! Prompt user to enter first number
  READ(*,*) num1                     ! Read user input

  WRITE(*,*) "Enter second number: "  ! Prompt user to enter second number
  READ(*,*) num2                     ! Read user input

  product = num1 * num2      ! Perform multiplication of numbers and store in variable

  WRITE(*,*) "The product of ", num1, " and ", num2, " is ", product   ! Print result to console
  STOP      ! End program execution
