! This is a complex code snippet in FORTRAN
! It calculates the value of a polynomial function at a given point using Horner's method
!
! Define the polynomial coefficients
real a(10), x, p
! Define the degree of the polynomial
integer n
! Input the value of the point
write(*,*) "Enter the value of x:"
read(*,*) x
! Input the degree of the polynomial
write(*,*) "Enter the degree of the polynomial:"
read(*,*) n
! Input the coefficients of the polynomial
write(*,*) "Enter the coefficients (in descending order) of the polynomial:"
do i = 1, n+1
  read(*,*) a(i)
end do
! Calculate the value of p at x using Horner's method
p = a(n+1)
do i = n, 1, -1
  p = p * x + a(i)
end do
! Print the results
write(*,*) "The value of the polynomial at x is:", p
