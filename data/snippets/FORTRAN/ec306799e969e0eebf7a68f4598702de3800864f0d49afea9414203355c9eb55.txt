! This program computes the sum of numbers from 1 to n

program sum
implicit none
integer :: n, i, sum

! Take input from user
write(*,*) 'Enter a positive integer: '
read(*,*) n

! Initialize sum to 0
sum = 0

! Use a loop to iterate from 1 to n
do i = 1, n

    ! Add i to sum
    sum = sum + i

end do

! Print the result
write(*,*) 'The sum of numbers from 1 to', n, 'is', sum

end program sum
