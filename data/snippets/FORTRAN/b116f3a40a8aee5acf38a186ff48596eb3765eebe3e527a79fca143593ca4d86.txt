PROGRAM heat_transfer
! This program calculates the heat transfer in a given system
! Define the constants
REAL :: k = 1.3 ! Thermal conductivity (W/mK)
REAL :: L = 2.5 ! Length of system (m)
REAL :: A = 0.5 ! Cross-sectional area (m^2)
REAL :: T1 = 100.0 ! Initial temperature (K)
REAL :: T2 = 50.0 ! Final temperature (K)
! Calculate the temperature difference
REAL :: dT = T1 - T2
! Calculate the heat transfer
REAL :: Q = (k * A * dT)/L
! Print the results
PRINT*, "The temperature difference is", dT, "K"
PRINT*, "The heat transfer is", Q, "W"
