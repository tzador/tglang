PROGRAM fibonacci
C This program calculates the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
      INTEGER I, FIB(20)
      FIB(1) = 0 !initialize first number in sequence
      FIB(2) = 1 !initialize second number in sequence
      DO 20 I = 3, 20 !loop through numbers 3 to 20
         FIB(I) = FIB(I-1) + FIB(I-2) !calculate next number in sequence
20    CONTINUE
      WRITE(*,*) 'The first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:'
      DO 30 I = 1, 20 !loop through numbers 1 to 20
         WRITE(*,*) FIB(I) !write each number in sequence
30    CONTINUE
