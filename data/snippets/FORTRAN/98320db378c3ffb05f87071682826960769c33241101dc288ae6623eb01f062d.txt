! This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence
PROGRAM FIBONACCI

! Declare variables to store user input and calculate sequence
INTEGER :: num_terms, i, first, second, next

! Get number of terms in sequence from user
WRITE(*,*) 'Enter the number of terms in the sequence:'
READ(*,*) num_terms

! Set initial values for first two terms
first = 0
second = 1

! Print first two terms
WRITE(*,*) 'The first two terms are:', first, second

! Loop to calculate and print remaining terms in sequence
DO i = 3, num_terms
    ! Calculate next term by adding previous two terms
    next = first + second
    ! Update values of first and second terms for next iteration
    first = second
    second = next
    ! Print current term
    WRITE(*,*) 'Term', i, '=', next
END DO
