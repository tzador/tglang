! Declaration of variables
INTEGER :: num, factorial
! Initialize the variables
num = 5
factorial = 1
! Use a DO loop to calculate factorial
DO i = 1, num
    ! Multiply factorial by the loop index 
    factorial = factorial * i
END DO
! Output the result
WRITE(*,*) 'The factorial of', num, 'is', factorial ! Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
