program quadratic_equation
!This program solves a quadratic equation
!with coefficients entered by the user

implicit none

!declaring variables
real :: a, b, c, delta, x1, x2
integer :: i, n

!asking user for input
write(*,*) "Enter the coefficient a: "
read(*,*) a
write(*,*) "Enter the coefficient b: "
read(*,*) b
write(*,*) "Enter the coefficient c: "
read(*,*) c

!calculating the discriminant
delta = b**2 - 4*a*c

!conditional statement to check if equation is solvable
if (delta >= 0) then
    !calculating roots
    x1 = (-b+sqrt(delta))/(2*a)
    x2 = (-b-sqrt(delta))/(2*a)
    
    !printing the solutions
    write(*,*) "The equation has two real solutions: ", x1, " and ", x2

else
    !printing an error message if equation is not solvable
    write(*,*) "The equation has no real solutions"
end if
