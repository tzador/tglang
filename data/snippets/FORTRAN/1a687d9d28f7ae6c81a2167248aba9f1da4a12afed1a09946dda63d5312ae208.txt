program complex_calc

! This program performs various complex calculations

real(8) :: a, b, c, d, e ! Declare real variables to store complex numbers
real(8) :: real_result, imag_result ! Declare variables to store calculation results
integer :: op_code ! Declare variable to store operation code

! Get input from user
print *, "Enter the first complex number (a + bi): "
read *, a, b
print *, "Enter the second complex number (c + di): "
read *, c, d
print *, "Enter the operation code (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication): "
read *, op_code

! Perform the selected operation
if (op_code == 1) then ! Addition
    real_result = a + c ! Calculate the real part
    imag_result = b + d ! Calculate the imaginary part
else if (op_code == 2) then ! Subtraction
    real_result = a - c ! Calculate the real part
    imag_result = b - d ! Calculate the imaginary part
else if (op_code == 3) then ! Multiplication
    real_result = a * c - b * d ! Calculate the real part
    imag_result = a * d + b * c ! Calculate the imaginary part
else ! Invalid operation code
    print *, "Invalid operation code"
end if

! Display the result
print *, "The result is: ", real_result, " + ", imag_result, "i"
