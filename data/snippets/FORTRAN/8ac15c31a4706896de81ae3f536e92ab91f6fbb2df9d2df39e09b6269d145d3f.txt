program complex_calc
!!This program calculates the sum of two complex numbers and prints the result
    implicit none
!Declare variables for real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers
    real :: real1, real2, ans_real
    real :: imag1, imag2, ans_imag
!Initialize the values of the complex numbers
    real1 = 5.0
    real2 = 3.0
    imag1 = -2.0
    imag2 = 4.0
!Calculate the sum of the complex numbers
    ans_real = real1 + real2
    ans_imag = imag1 + imag2
!Print the result in standard form
    print *, "The sum of the complex numbers is: ", trim(adjustl(real(ans_real,ans_imag)))
