! This code snippet calculates the first n Fibonacci numbers

program fibonacci

  implicit none ! turns on strict typing
  integer :: n, i, fib_number
  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: fib_series

  print *, "Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to calculate:"
  read *, n ! get user input for number of Fibonacci numbers

  ! allocate memory to store the Fibonacci series
  allocate(fib_series(n))

  ! initialize the first two numbers in the series
  fib_series(1) = 0
  fib_series(2) = 1

  ! loop to calculate remaining Fibonacci numbers
  do i = 3, n
    fib_series(i) = fib_series(i-1) + fib_series(i-2)
  end do

  ! print the Fibonacci series
  do i = 1, n
    fib_number = fib_series(i)
    print *, "Fibonacci number", i, "is:", fib_number
  end do

  ! deallocate the allocated memory
  deallocate(fib_series)

end program fibonacci
