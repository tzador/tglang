! This is a program that calculates the trajectory of a projectile
! given initial velocity, angle, and time step values

program projectile_trajectory

implicit none

! Define variables and their data types
real :: x, y, v, theta, t
real, parameter :: g = 9.8 ! Gravity constant
integer :: i, nsteps

! Get user input for initial conditions
print *, "Enter initial x position (m): "
read *, x
print *, "Enter initial y position (m): "
read *, y
print *, "Enter initial velocity (m/s): "
read *, v
print *, "Enter launch angle (degrees): "
read *, theta
theta = theta * (pi/180.0) ! Convert to radians
print *, "Enter number of time steps: "
read *, nsteps

! Loop through each time step
do i = 1, nsteps
    ! Calculate new position using kinematics equations
    t = i * 0.1 ! Time step of 0.1 seconds
    x = x + v * cos(theta) * t
    y = y + v * sin(theta) * t - 0.5 * g * t**2
    ! Print results for current time step
    write(*, *) "Time step = ", i, " Position = (", x, ", ", y, ")"
