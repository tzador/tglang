! This code snippet calculates the average of three numbers

program average
    implicit none
    integer :: a, b, c, average
    real :: sum

    ! User inputs three integer numbers
    write(*,*) 'Enter the first number:'
    read(*,*) a
    write(*,*) 'Enter the second number:'
    read(*,*) b
    write(*,*) 'Enter the third number:'
    read(*,*) c

    ! Calculates the sum of the three numbers
    sum = a + b + c

    ! Calculates the average 
    average = sum / 3.0

    ! Prints the average to the screen
    write(*,*) 'The average of the three numbers is', average
end program average
