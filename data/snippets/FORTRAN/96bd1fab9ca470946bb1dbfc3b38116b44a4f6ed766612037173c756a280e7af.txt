PROGRAM matrix_operations

! This program performs basic matrix operations
! such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication

IMPLICIT NONE

! Declaring variables for matrices A, B, and C
INTEGER :: n, m, p ! dimensions of A, B, and C respectively
DOUBLE PRECISION, DIMENSION(:,:), ALLOCATABLE :: A, B, C ! matrices themselves

! Get inputs for dimensions of A and B
PRINT *, "Enter dimensions for A and B:"
READ *, n, m, p 

! Allocate memory for matrices A, B, and C
ALLOCATE(A(n,m), B(m,p), C(n,p))

! Get input for matrix A
PRINT *, "Enter elements for matrix A:"
READ *, A

! Get input for matrix B
PRINT *, "Enter elements for matrix B:"
READ *, B

! Perform matrix addition
C = A + B

! Print result
PRINT *, "Result of A + B:"
PRINT *, C

! Perform matrix subtraction
C = A - B

! Print result
PRINT *, "Result of A - B:"
PRINT *, C

! Perform matrix multiplication
C = MATMUL(A, B)

! Print result
PRINT *, "Result of A * B:"
PRINT *, C

! Deallocate memory for matrices A, B, and
