PROGRAM main
! This is the main program
IMPLICIT NONE
! Disables implicit type conversion
INTEGER :: i, j, k
! Declares 3 integer variables
! This is a loop over i values from 1 to 10 with a step of 2
DO i=1, 10, 2
! This is a nested loop over j values from 1 to 5 with a step of 1
DO j=1, 5, 1
! This is a nested loop over k values from 1 to 3 with a step of 1
DO k=1, 3, 1
! This calculates the value of i-j*k and stores it in the variable 'result'
RESULT = i - j * k
! This prints the value of 'result' using formatted output
! The format specifies that the value should be printed with 2 decimal places and in scientific notation
WRITE(*, '(F0.2, ES20.12)') result
ENDDO ! End of k loop
