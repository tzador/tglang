! This is a program to calculate the sum of two numbers

program sum_of_numbers  ! Define a new program with name "sum_of_numbers"

implicit none  ! Avoid implicit typing of variables

integer :: num1, num2, sum  ! Declare three integer variables for input and output

! Get the input from the user

write(*, *) "Enter the first number:"  ! Print a message to the user
read(*, *) num1  ! Read input from user and store in num1

write(*, *) "Enter the second number:" ! Print another message to the user
read(*, *) num2 ! Read input from user and store in num2

! Calculate the sum of the two numbers

sum = num1 + num2  ! Assign the sum of num1 and num2 to the sum variable

! Print the result

write(*, *) "The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum  ! Print the result to the user

end program sum_of_numbers  ! End the program
