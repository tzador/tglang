PROGRAM PRIME
C This program takes a user-input number and checks whether it is a prime number.
      INTEGER NUM, I, FLAG
      READ (*,*) NUM              ! Takes user-input and assigns it to NUM
      FLAG = 0                    ! Sets FLAG to 0 initially
      DO I = 2, NUM-1             ! Loop to check for factors
         IF (NUM .MOD. I == 0) THEN ! If NUM is divisible by I with 0 remainder
            FLAG = 1                ! Set FLAG to 1 (not prime)
            EXIT                    ! Exit loop since factor found
         ENDIF
      ENDDO
      IF (FLAG == 0) THEN         ! If FLAG not changed (prime)
         WRITE (*,*) NUM, "is a prime number"
      ELSE                        ! If FLAG changed (not prime)
         WRITE (*,*) NUM, "is not a prime number"
      ENDIF
      END
