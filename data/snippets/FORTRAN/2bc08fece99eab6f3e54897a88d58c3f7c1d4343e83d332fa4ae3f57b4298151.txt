PROGRAM ComplexCalculation
! Program to calculate the complex roots of a quadratic equation
IMPLICIT NONE ! Explicit declaration of variables
REAL :: a, b, c ! Real numbers for coefficients
COMPLEX :: x1, x2, discriminant ! Complex roots and discriminant
WRITE(*,*) 'Enter the coefficients of the quadratic equation:'
READ(*,*) a, b, c ! Allowing user input for coefficients
! Calculating discriminant
discriminant = b**2 - (4.0*a*c) ! ** denotes power in FORTRAN
IF (discriminant .LT. 0) THEN ! If discriminant is less than 0
    WRITE(*,*) 'The equation has complex roots'
ELSE ! If discriminant is greater than or equal to 0
    x1 = (-b + SQRT(discriminant))/(2.0*a) ! Calculating first root
    x2 = (-b - SQRT(discriminant))/(2.0*a) ! Calculating second root
    WRITE(*,*) 'The roots of the equation are', x1, x2
END IF ! End of IF statement
