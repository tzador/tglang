program complex_calculations
! This program performs complex calculations using user input

implicit none ! ensures all variables are explicitly declared

real :: x, y, result ! declares three real variables for input and output
integer :: a, b ! declares two integer variables for input

! user inputs values for variables
print *, "Please enter a value for x:"
read *, x
print *, "Please enter a value for y:"
read *, y
print *, "Please enter a value for a:"
read *, a
print *, "Please enter a value for b:"
read *, b

result = (x**2 + 2*y - a/(b+1)) / (a**3 + b**2 + log10(x+y))

print *, "The complex calculation result is: ", result ! print result to user
