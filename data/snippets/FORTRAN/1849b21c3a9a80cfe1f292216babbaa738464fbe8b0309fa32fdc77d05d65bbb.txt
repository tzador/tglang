! This is a comment in FORTRAN
! Declaration of variables
INTEGER*4 :: num, i ! integer variable for input and loop
REAL*8 :: fact, factorial ! real variables for factorial computation
! Prompt user for input
PRINT *, 'Enter a number: '
READ *, num ! read input and store in num variable
factorial = 1 ! initialize factorial variable
! Use DO loop to calculate factorial of input number
DO i = 1, num
    factorial = factorial * i ! multiply factorial variable with loop index
END DO
! Print result
PRINT *, 'Factorial of ', num, ' is ', factorial
! End of program
END
