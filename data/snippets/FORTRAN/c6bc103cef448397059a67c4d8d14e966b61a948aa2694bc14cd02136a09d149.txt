program complexNumbers
! This program calculates the product of two complex numbers

! Define complex number variables
complex :: num1, num2, total

! Initialize values for the two complex numbers
num1 = cmplx(2.5, 3.2)
num2 = cmplx(4.1, 1.7)

! Calculate the product of the two complex numbers
total = num1 * num2

! Print output
write(*,*) "The product of ", num1, "and", num2, "is", total

end program complexNumbers
