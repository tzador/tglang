PROGRAM ComplexNumCalculator

    IMPLICIT NONE
    
    ! This program calculates the sum and product of two complex numbers.
    
    ! Define variables for the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number.
    REAL :: realPart1
    REAL :: imaginaryPart1
    
    ! Define variables for the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number.
    REAL :: realPart2
    REAL :: imaginaryPart2
    
    ! Define variables for the real and imaginary parts of the sum and product.
    REAL :: realSum
    REAL :: realProduct
    REAL :: imaginarySum
    REAL :: imaginaryProduct
    
    ! Prompt user to enter the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number.
    WRITE(*,*) 'Enter the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number:'
    READ(*,*) realPart1, imaginaryPart1
    
    ! Prompt user to enter the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number.
    WRITE(*,*) 'Enter the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number:'
    READ(*,*) realPart2, imaginaryPart2
    
    ! Calculate the real and imaginary parts of the sum.
    realSum = realPart1 + realPart2
    imaginarySum = imaginaryPart1 + imaginaryPart2
    
    ! Calculate the real and imaginary parts of the product.
    realProduct = (realPart1 * realPart2) - (imaginaryPart1 * imaginaryPart2)
    imaginaryProduct = (realPart1 * imaginaryPart2) + (imaginaryPart1 * realPart2)
    
    ! Display the results to the user.
    WRITE(*,*) 'Sum: ', realSum, ' + ', imaginarySum, 'i'
    WRITE(*,*) 'Product: ', realProduct, ' + ', imaginaryProduct, 'i'
