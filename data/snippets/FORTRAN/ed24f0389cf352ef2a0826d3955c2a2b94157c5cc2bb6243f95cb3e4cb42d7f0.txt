PROGRAM quadratic

! This program solves quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0

! Declare variables a, b, c, x1, x2, and disc for storing coefficients and solutions

REAL :: a, b, c ! Declare variables as single-precision real numbers
REAL :: x1, x2, disc

! Prompt user for input of coefficients

PRINT *, "Enter the coefficients of the quadratic equation:"
PRINT *, "a: "
READ *, a
PRINT *, "b: "
READ *, b
PRINT *, "c: "
READ *, c

! Calculate discriminant

disc = b**2 - 4*a*c

! Check if discriminant is negative (no real solutions)

IF (disc < 0.0) THEN
    PRINT *, "This quadratic equation has no real solutions."
! Check if discriminant is equal to zero (one real solution)
ELSE IF (disc == 0.0) THEN
    x1 = -b / (2*a)
    PRINT *, "This quadratic equation has one real solution:", x1
! Otherwise, calculate both solutions
ELSE
    x1 = (-b + SQRT(disc)) / (2*a)
    x2 = (-b - SQRT(disc)) / (2*a)
    PRINT *, "This quadratic equation has two real solutions:", x1, "and", x2
END IF
