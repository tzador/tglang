! This program calculates the factorial of an integer given by the user
! Declaring variables
      INTEGER :: n, i, fact ! declare n and i as integer, fact as an output variable
      fact = 1 ! initializing fact to 1
! Accepting user input
      print *, "Enter an integer: " ! asks user for input
      read *, n ! reads user's input and stores it in variable n
! Applying loop to calculate factorial
      do i = 1,n
        fact = fact*i ! multiplying fact with each iteration of loop
      end do
! Outputting result
      print *, "The factorial of", n, "is", fact ! prints the result
