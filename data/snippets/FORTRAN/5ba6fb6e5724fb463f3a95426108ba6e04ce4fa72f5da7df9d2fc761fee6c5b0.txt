program calculate_mean
! This program calculates the mean of an array of numbers
implicit none
integer :: n, i ! declare variables
real :: mean = 0.0, sum = 0.0 ! initialize mean and sum variables
real, dimension(50) :: numbers ! define array of numbers with size 50
! User input
print *, 'Enter the number of elements:'
read *, n ! read in number of elements
print *, 'Enter', n, 'numbers:'
do i = 1, n ! loop to read in numbers and add them to the array
    read *, numbers(i)
end do
! Calculate the mean
do i = 1, n ! loop to sum all the numbers
    sum = sum + numbers(i)
end do
mean = sum / n ! divide sum by number of elements to get mean
! Output
print *, 'The mean is:', mean ! print out the calculated mean
end program calculate_mean
