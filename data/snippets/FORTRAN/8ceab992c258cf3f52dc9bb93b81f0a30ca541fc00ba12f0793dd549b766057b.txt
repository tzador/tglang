! This is a FORTRAN code that calculates the factorial of a given number

PROGRAM factorial

    ! Declare variables
    INTEGER :: num, factorial

    ! Get input from user
    WRITE(*,*) 'Enter a number: '
    READ(*,*) num

    ! Initialize factorial to 1
    factorial = 1

    ! Loop through numbers from 1 to num
    DO i = 1,num
        ! Multiply factorial by current number
        factorial = factorial * i
    END DO

    ! Print result
    WRITE(*,*) 'Factorial of ', num, ' is: ', factorial

END PROGRAM factorial
