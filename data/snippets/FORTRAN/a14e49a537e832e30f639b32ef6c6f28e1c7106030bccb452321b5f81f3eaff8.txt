    implicit none
    ! This program performs complex calculations using FORTRAN
    ! Declaring variables
    real :: x, y, z ! declare three single precision real variables
    complex :: a, b, c ! declare three complex variables

    ! Set values for variables
    x = 1.5
    y = 2.5
    
    ! Perform calculations and store results in complex variables
    a = (x+3*y)/(y-2)
    b = exp(x)*cos(y)
    c = a**3 + b**2

    ! Print results
    print *, "The value of a is ", a
    print *, "The value of b is ", b
    print *, "The value of c is ", c
