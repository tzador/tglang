! This program calculates the roots of a quadratic equation

program quadratic_equation

! Declaring variables
    real :: a, b, c, disc, root1, root2

! Receiving input from user for coefficients
    print*, "Enter the value of coefficient a: "
    read*, a
    print*, "Enter the value of coefficient b: "
    read*, b
    print*, "Enter the value of coefficient c: "
    read*, c

! Calculating the discriminant 
    disc = b**2 - 4 * a * c

! Condition to check if the equation has real roots
    if (disc >= 0) then

! Calculating the first root
        root1 = (-b + sqrt(disc)) / (2 * a)
! Calculating the second root
        root2 = (-b - sqrt(disc)) / (2 * a)

! Printing the results
        print*, "The first root is: ", root1
        print*, "The second root is: ", root2

! Condition for complex roots
    else if (disc < 0) then
        print*, "The equation has complex roots."
    end if
