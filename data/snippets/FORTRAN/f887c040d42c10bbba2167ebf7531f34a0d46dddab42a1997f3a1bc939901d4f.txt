! This is a program in FORTRAN that calculates the factorial of a number
program factorial
  implicit none               ! ensures all variables are declared
  integer :: num, fact, i     ! declares variables
  fact = 1                    ! sets initial value of factorial to 1
  print *, "Enter a number: "  ! prompts user to input a number
  read *, num                  ! reads user input
  do i = 1, num               ! loop to calculate factorial
    fact = fact * i            ! factorial formula 
  end do                      ! ends loop
  print *, "The factorial of ", num, " is ", fact ! prints final result
end program factorial        ! end of program
