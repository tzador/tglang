! This program calculates the value of the first 10 terms
! in the Fourier series for a given function

program fourier_series

  implicit none

  ! Declare variables
  real*8, dimension(10) :: a  ! Coefficients
  real*8 :: x                ! Independent variable
  real*8 :: sum              ! Sum of terms
  real*8 :: range            ! Range of independent variable
  integer :: n               ! Number of terms
  integer :: i               ! Loop index

  ! Assign values to variables
  x = 2.0                    ! Independent variable
  range = 2.0                ! Range of independent variable
  n = 10                     ! Number of terms
  sum = 0.0                  ! Initialize sum variable

  ! Calculate coefficients
  do i = 1, n
    a(i) = sin(i*x) / i      ! Coefficient formula
  end do

  ! Perform sum of terms
  do i = 1, n
    sum = sum + a(i)         ! Add current term to sum
  end do

  ! Print results
  print *, "The value of the first 10 terms in the Fourier series for x = ", x
  print *, "is ", sum
