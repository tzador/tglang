! This code snippet uses a DO loop to calculate the factorial of a given number

program factorial

implicit none     
integer :: num, fact, i

print *, "Enter a positive integer: "  ! prompts user to enter a positive integer 
read *, num                           ! reads the input and stores it in 'num'

if (num < 0) then                     ! checks if input is a negative number
    print *, "Error! Factorial of negative numbers does not exist"
else if (num == 0) then                ! checks if input is 0
    fact = 1                           ! if input is 0, factorial is 1
else
    do i = 1, num                      ! starts a DO loop from 1 to the input number
        fact = fact * i                ! multiplies 'fact' by 'i'
    end do
end if


print *, "Factorial of ", num, " is ", fact   ! prints the output 
end program factorial                         ! end of program
