! This code calculates the average of an array of numbers

PROGRAM AVERAGE

	! Initialize variables
	REAL :: sum = 0.0
	REAL :: avg = 0.0
	INTEGER :: i, n

	! Set the size of the array to be 10
	n = 10

	! Define the array
	REAL, DIMENSION(n) :: numbers = (/1.5, 2.3, 4.0, 6.8, 9.1, 3.2, 7.6, 5.4, 8.9, 0.5/)

	! Loop through the array to calculate the sum of all numbers
	DO i = 1, n
		sum = sum + numbers(i)
	END DO

	! Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements
	avg = sum / n

	! Print the average
	PRINT *, "The average of the array is: ", avg

END PROGRAM AVERAGE
