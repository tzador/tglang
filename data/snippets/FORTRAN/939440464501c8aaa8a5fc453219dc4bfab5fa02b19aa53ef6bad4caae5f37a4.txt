! This is a code snippet in FORTRAN to calculate the sum of squares of first n natural numbers
! Program name: sqsum

program sqsum
    implicit none                   ! Declares all variables explicitly
    integer :: n, i, sum            ! Declaring variables
    
    write(*,*) 'Enter the value of n:'
    read*, n                        ! User input for n
    
    sum = 0                         ! Setting initial value of sum to 0
    
    do i = 1, n                     ! Looping through all numbers from 1 to n
        sum = sum + i**2            ! Adding the square of the current number to the sum
    end do
    
    write(*,*) 'The sum of squares of first ', n, ' natural numbers is: ', sum
end program sqsum
