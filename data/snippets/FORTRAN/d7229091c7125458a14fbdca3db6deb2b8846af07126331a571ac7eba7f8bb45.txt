PROGRAM Fibonacci
! This program calculates the first 20 numbers in the
! Fibonacci sequence.

! Declaration of variables
INTEGER :: a, b, c, i

! Setting initial values for the first two numbers in the sequence
a = 0
b = 1

! Loop to iterate and calculate the next number in the sequence
DO i = 1, 20
    ! Calculating the next number by adding the previous two numbers
    c = a + b

    ! Outputting the current number in the sequence
    PRINT *, c

    ! Swapping values to calculate the next number
    a = b
    b = c
END DO
