c Comments in FORTRAN are denoted using the 'c' character in column 1.

c Variable declarations come after a statement denoting the type, which is designated by the first character.
  INTEGER :: i, j, n, fac   c These are integers used in the program
  REAL :: pi                 c A real number (single precision) for the value of pi
  CHARACTER(20) :: message   c A string variable with length of 20 characters
  LOGICAL :: flag             c A logical variable representing a boolean value

c Initializing values
  n = 10                     c Setting n equal to 10
  pi = 3.14159               c Approximating the value of pi
  message = "Hello, world!"  c Assigning a string to the variable
  flag = .TRUE.              c Setting flag to be true

c A FORTRAN do loop is used to perform a sequence of statements a fixed number of times.
  DO i = 1, n                
    j = i - 1                
    fac = 1                  
    DO WHILE (j >= 1)        
      fac = fac * j          
      j = j - 1              
    END DO                   

c Print statements are used to output values to the screen.
    PRINT*, 'The factorial of', i, 'is', fac
  END DO                      c Ends the do loop

c Conditional statements can also be used in FORTRAN, here we are checking if n is a prime number.
  IF (n <= 1) THEN            c If n is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime
    flag = .FALSE.            c Set flag to false
  ELSE                        c If n is greater than 1
    DO j = 2, n - 1           c A do loop from 2 to n-1
      IF (MOD(n, j) == 0)     c If n is divisible by j, it is not prime
        flag = .FALSE.        c Set flag to false and exit the do loop
        EXIT
      END IF
    END DO
  END IF

c Finally, print the result based on the value of flag
  IF (flag) THEN              c If flag is true, n is prime
    PRINT*, n, 'is a prime number.'
  ELSE                        c If flag is false, n is not prime
    PRINT*, n, 'is not a prime number.'
  END IF
