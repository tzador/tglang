PROGRAM test

  ! This program calculates the sum of two numbers and prints the result

  IMPLICIT NONE      ! ensures that all variables must be declared before use

  REAL :: num1, num2, sum    ! declares variables as real numbers
  INTEGER :: i      ! declares a variable as an integer

  ! asks user to enter two numbers
  WRITE(*,*) "Enter the first number: "
  READ(*,*) num1

  WRITE(*,*) "Enter the second number: "
  READ(*,*) num2

  sum = num1 + num2   ! calculates the sum of the two numbers

  ! prints the result
  WRITE(*,*) "The sum of the two numbers is: ", sum

  ! loops through numbers from 1 to 10 and prints their squares
  DO i=1,10
    WRITE(*,*) "The square of ", i, " is ", i*i
  END DO

  STOP     ! stops the program
