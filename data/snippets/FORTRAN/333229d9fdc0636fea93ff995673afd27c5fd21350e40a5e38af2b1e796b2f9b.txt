! This is a code snippet in FORTRAN

program example  ! Defines the start of the program

  implicit none  ! Ensures all variables are explicitly declared
  
  real :: x, y     ! Declares two real numbers, x and y
  integer :: i, j  ! Declares two integers, i and j
  
  print *, "Enter the value of x: "     ! Prints a message to the screen
  read *, x       ! Reads user input and stores it in the variable x
  
  print *, "Enter the value of y: "
  read *, y
  
  do i = 1, 10   ! Starts a do loop that iterates 10 times
    j = i + 2    ! Adds 2 to the value of i and assigns it to j
    x = x + j    ! Adds the value of j to the current value of x
    print *, "The current value of x is: ", x  ! Prints the current value of x
  end do         ! Ends the do loop
  
  if (x > y) then        ! Starts an if statement that checks if x is greater than y
    print *, "x is greater than y"   ! Prints a message if the condition is true
  else                    ! If the condition is false, executes the following statement
    print *, "x is not greater than y"
  endif                   ! Ends the if statement
  
  x = 0          ! Assigns the value of 0 to x
  
  do while (x < 5)      ! Starts a do while loop that will continue until x is equal to 5
    x = x + 1           ! Adds 1 to the current value of x and assigns it to x
    print *, "The current value of x is: ", x ! Prints the current value of x
  end do                ! Ends the do while loop
  
end program example  ! Defines the end of the program
