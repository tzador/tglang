program complex_multiply
	! This program multiplies two complex numbers
	! given by the user and prints the result

	implicit none

	! Define variables to store the real and imaginary parts
	real :: a_real, b_real, a_imag, b_imag, c_real, c_imag

	! Prompt user to input first complex number
	print *, "Please enter the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number: "
	read *, a_real, a_imag

	! Prompt user to input second complex number
	print *, "Please enter the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number: "
	read *, b_real, b_imag

	! Calculate the real and imaginary parts of the result
	c_real = a_real * b_real - a_imag * b_imag
