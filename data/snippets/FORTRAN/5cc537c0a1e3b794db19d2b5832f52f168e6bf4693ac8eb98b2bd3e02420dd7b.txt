!This is a FORTRAN program that calculates the mean and standard deviation of an array of numbers
implicit none 

integer :: n, i !declaring integer variables for the number of elements in the array and loop index
real :: mean, stdDev !declaring real variables for the mean and standard deviation
real, dimension(100) :: numbers !declaring an array of 100 elements to store the numbers

print *, "Enter number of elements: " 
read *, n !reading in the number of elements from user input

print *, "Enter the numbers: " 
do i = 1, n !looping through each element in the array
  read *, numbers(i) !reading in the numbers from user input and storing in array
end do

mean = 0 !initializing mean to 0
do i = 1, n !looping through each element in the array
  mean = mean + numbers(i) !summation of all elements in array
end do
mean = mean/n !calculating mean by dividing sum by number of elements

stdDev = 0 !initializing standard deviation to 0
do i = 1, n !looping through each element in the array
  stdDev = stdDev + (numbers(i) - mean)**2 !summation of squared differences from mean
end do
stdDev = sqrt(stdDev/n) !calculating standard deviation by dividing sum by number of elements and taking square root

print *, "Mean: ", mean !printing the mean
print *, "Standard Deviation: ", stdDev !printing the standard deviation

end program
