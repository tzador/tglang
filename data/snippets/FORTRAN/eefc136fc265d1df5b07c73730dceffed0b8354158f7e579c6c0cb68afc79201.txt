program complex_calculator
! This program performs complex number calculations

real :: num1_real, num2_real, num1_imag, num2_imag   ! declares real variables
real :: sum_real, diff_real, product_real  ! declares variables to store results
real :: sum_imag, diff_imag, product_imag  ! declares variables to store results

! input first complex number
print *, "Enter the real part of the first complex number:"
read *, num1_real
print *, "Enter the imaginary part of the first complex number:"
read *, num1_imag

! input second complex number
print *, "Enter the real part of the second complex number:"
read *, num2_real
print *, "Enter the imaginary part of the second complex number:"
read *, num2_imag

! calculate sum
sum_real = num1_real + num2_real
sum_imag = num1_imag + num2_imag

! calculate difference
diff_real = num1_real - num2_real
diff_imag = num1_imag - num2_imag

! calculate product
product_real = num1_real * num2_real - num1_imag * num2_imag
product_imag = num1_real * num2_imag + num1_imag * num2_real

! output results
print *, "The sum is: ", sum_real, "+", sum_imag, "i"
print *, "The difference is: ", diff_real, "+", diff_imag, "i"
print *, "The product is: ", product_real, "+", product_imag, "i"
