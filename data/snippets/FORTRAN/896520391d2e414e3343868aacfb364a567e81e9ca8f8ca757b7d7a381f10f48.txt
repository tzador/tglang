c This code snippet defines a double DO loop in FORTRAN that iterates 
c over two variables, I and J, with a range of 1 to N.
c Within the loop, a value of 2.2 is multiplied by the difference 
c between J and I, which is then stored in the AMAT matrix at the 
c corresponding (I,J) coordinates.
c CONTINUE indicates the end of the loop, and the loop will continue 
c until the condition is met.
c All lines starting with 'c' are comments.
