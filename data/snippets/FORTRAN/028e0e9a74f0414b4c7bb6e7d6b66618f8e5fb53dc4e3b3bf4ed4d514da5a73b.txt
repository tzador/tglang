! This program calculates the total area under a curve using Simpson's rule
program area

implicit none
integer :: n, i
real :: a, b, x, h, sum
real :: f
! n is the number of intervals used to approximate the area under the curve
! i is the loop variable
! a and b are the lower and upper limits of the integration interval
! x is the current point on the x-axis
! h is the step size between two consecutive points on the x-axis
! sum holds the sum of the area under each interval
! f holds the value of the function at the current point

! Set the value of n based on user input
write(*, *) "Enter the number of intervals: "
read(*, *) n

! Set the values of a and b based on user input
write(*, *) "Enter the lower limit of integration: "
read(*, *) a
write(*, *) "Enter the upper limit of integration: "
read(*, *) b

! Compute the step size
h = (b-a)/n

! Initialize sum to 0
sum = 0

! Begin the loop to calculate the area under each interval
do i = 1, n
    ! Calculate the current point on the x-axis
    x = a + (i-1)*h
    
    ! Evaluate the function at the current point
    f = 2*x + 3*x**2 + 4*x**3
    
    ! Add the area under the current interval to the sum
    sum = sum + (h/3)*(f + 4*f(x+h/2) + f(x+h))
    
end do

! Print the result
write(*,*) "The total area under the curve is ", sum
