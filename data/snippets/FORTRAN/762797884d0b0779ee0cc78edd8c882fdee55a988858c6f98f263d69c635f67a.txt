! This code calculates the sum of squares of the numbers from 1 to n
program sum_of_squares
    ! Declare variables
    integer :: n, i, sum
    ! Prompt user for input
    print *, "Enter a positive integer:"
    read *, n
    ! Initialize sum

    ! Loop through numbers from 1 to n
    do i = 1, n
        ! Calculate square of i and add to sum
        sum = sum + i**2
    end do
    ! Print result
