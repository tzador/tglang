! This code snippet demonstrates the use of nested if statements in FORTRAN

! Declare variables
integer :: x, y

! Get input from user
print *, "Enter values for x and y:"
read *, x, y

! Check if x is less than or equal to y
if (x <= y) then

    ! Check if x is equal to y
    if (x == y) then
        print *, "x is equal to y"
    else
        print *, "x is less than y"
    
    ! Check if y is even
    if (mod(y, 2) == 0) then
        print *, "y is an even number"
    end if
    
! If x is not less than or equal to y, check if x is greater than y
else if (x > y) then
    print *, "x is greater than y" 
    
    ! Check if x is divisible by y
    if (mod(x, y) == 0) then
        print *, "x is divisible by y"
    end if

! If none of the above conditions are met, print error message
else
    print *, "Invalid input. Please enter valid values for x and y."
end if
