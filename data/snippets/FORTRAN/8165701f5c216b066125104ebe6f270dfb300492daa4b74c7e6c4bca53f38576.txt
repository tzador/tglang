! This program calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
program fibonacci
    implicit none
    integer :: n, term, a = 0, b = 1, temp ! declaring variables as integers
    ! n is the desired term, term is the result, a and b are used for calculations, temp is a temporary variable
    print*, "Enter the value of n:"
    read*, n ! read in the value of n from user
    term = a ! initializing term to 0
    do while (n >= 0) ! loop until desired term is reached
        temp = a + b ! calculating next term
        a = b ! shifting values
        b = temp ! shifting values
        term = temp ! updating term
        n = n - 1 ! decrementing n
    end do ! end loop
    print*, "The nth term of the Fibonacci sequence is:", term
