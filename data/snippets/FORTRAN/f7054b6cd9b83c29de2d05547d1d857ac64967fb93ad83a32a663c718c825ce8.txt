! This program calculates the value of the n-th term in a Fibonacci sequence,
! using an iterative approach.

program fibonacci

    implicit none

    !Declaring variables
    integer :: n, fibResult, prev1, prev2, i

    print *, "Enter the value of n: "
    read *, n

    !Initializing first two terms of the sequence
    prev1 = 0
    prev2 = 1

    !Calculating the n-th term
    if (n == 0) then
        fibResult = prev1
    elseif (n == 1) then
        fibResult = prev2
    else
        do i = 2, n
            fibResult = prev1 + prev2
            prev1 = prev2
            prev2 = fibResult
        enddo
    endif

    !Printing the result
    print *, "The n-th term in the Fibonacci sequence is: ", fibResult
