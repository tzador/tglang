! Input from the user
      READ (*,*) n
! Declare variables
      INTEGER :: i, factorial
! Initialize factorial variable
      factorial = 1
! Loop over numbers from 1 to n
      DO i = 1, n
! Calculate factorial by multiplying current value with number
         factorial = factorial * i
      END DO
! Print the result
      PRINT *, "Factorial of", n, "is", factorial
! End program
