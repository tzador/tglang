PROGRAM myprogram
! This line initializes the start of the program

IMPLICIT NONE
! This line ensures that all variables must be explicitly declared

INTEGER :: n, factorial, i
! This line declares an integer variable 'n' used for input, an integer variable 'factorial' for calculation, and an integer variable 'i' for loop indexing

PRINT *, "Enter a number: "
! This line prints a prompt for user input

READ *, n
! This line reads in an integer value from user input and stores it in 'n'

factorial = 1
! This line initializes 'factorial' to 1

DO i = 1, n
! This line begins a 'DO' loop that iterates from 1 to 'n'
    factorial = factorial * i
    ! This line calculates the factorial by multiplying 'factorial' by 'i' at each iteration

END DO
! This line marks the end of the 'DO' loop

PRINT *, "Factorial of", n, "is", factorial
! This line prints the result of the factorial calculation

END PROGRAM myprogram
! This line marks the end of the program
