PROGRAM myProgram
! This is a FORTRAN program that calculates the factorial of a number
IMPLICIT NONE  ! ensures all variables must be declared
INTEGER :: num, fac, i  ! declares integer variables

! reading input from user
PRINT*, "Enter a number: "  ! prompts user to enter a number
READ*, num  ! reads the input number

! initializing factorial to 1
fac = 1

! calculating factorial using do loop
DO i = 1, num  ! do loop iterates from 1 to num
    fac = fac * i  ! calculates factorial by multiplying with each iteration
END DO  ! end of do loop

! printing output
PRINT*, "Factorial of ", num, " is ", fac  ! prints the result to the screen
END PROGRAM  ! end of program
