! This is a code snippet in FORTRAN
real :: x(10), avg, sum
integer :: i

! Initializing the array with values
do i = 1, 10
    x(i) = i
end do

! Calculating the average of the array
sum = 0
do i = 1, 10
    sum = sum + x(i)
end do
avg = sum / 10

! Printing the results
print*, "The average of the array is: ", avg

! Evaluating conditional statements
if (avg >= 5) then
    print*, "The average is greater than or equal to 5"
else
    print*, "The average is less than 5"
end if

! Calculating the factorial of a number
integer :: n, factorial
factorial = 1
do n = 1, 5
    factorial = factorial * n
end do

! Printing the factorial
print*, "The factorial of 5 is: ", factorial

! Finding the largest number in the array
integer :: max
max = x(1)
do i = 2, 10
    if (x(i) > max) then
        max = x(i)
    end if
end do
print*, "The largest number in the array is: ", max

! Solving a quadratic equation
real :: a, b, c, x1, x2, discriminant
! Input coefficients
print*, "Enter the coefficients (a, b, c) of the quadratic equation: "
read*, a, b, c

! Calculating the discriminant
discriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c

! Checking the number and type of roots
if (discriminant > 0) then
    x1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)
    x2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)
    print*, "The roots are real and distinct: ", x1, x2
else if (discriminant == 0) then
    x1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)
    print*, "The root is real and equal: ", x1
else
    print*, "The roots are complex and distinct."

! Subroutine to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
subroutine convert_temp(f, c)

! Main program
real :: fahrenheit, celsius
print*, "Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: "
read*, fahrenheit
