! This is a program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
  ! The variable `n` holds the user-defined limit for the sequence
  integer :: n

  ! Prompt user for input
  print *, 'Enter the limit for the Fibonacci sequence:'
  read *, n

  ! Initialize array to hold the sequence
  integer, dimension(n) :: fibonacci

  ! Set first two elements of array to 0 and 1, since they are known values in the sequence
  fibonacci(1) = 0
  fibonacci(2) = 1

  ! Loop through the rest of the array, calculating each element as the sum of the previous two
  do i = 3, n
    fibonacci(i) = fibonacci(i-1) + fibonacci(i-2)
  end do

  ! Print out the calculated sequence
  print *, 'The Fibonacci sequence up to', n, 'is:'
  do i = 1, n
    print *, fibonacci(i)
  end do

  ! End program
  end program
