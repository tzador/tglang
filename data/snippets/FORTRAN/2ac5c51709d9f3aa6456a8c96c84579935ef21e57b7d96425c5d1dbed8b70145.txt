! In FORTRAN, the "!" symbol is used for comments

! This program calculates the sum and product of the first n natural numbers

program summation
  implicit none                  ! to ensure all variables are declared explicitly
  integer :: n                   ! declare the variable n as an integer
  real :: sum, prod              ! declare the variables sum and prod as real numbers

  print *, "Enter a value for n: "  ! prompt the user to enter a value for n
  read *, n                         ! read in the value for n from the user 

  sum = 0                       ! initialize the variable sum to 0

  do i = 1, n                 ! loop from i = 1 to n, incrementing by 1 each time
    sum = sum + i             ! add i to the current value of sum
    prod = prod * i           ! multiply i by the current value of prod
  end do                       ! end of do loop

  print *, "The sum is: ", sum            ! print the value of sum
  print *, "The product is: ", prod    ! print the value of prod 

end program summation    ! end of program
