! This program calculates the factorial of a given number
program factorial
implicit none
integer :: n, i, fact ! Define variables for input, loop counter, and factorial result
print*, "Enter a number: "
read*, n ! Prompt user for input and read it into n
fact = 1 ! Set initial value of fact to 1
do i = 1, n ! Start loop from 1 to n
fact = fact * i ! Multiply current factorial value by loop counter
end do
print*, "The factorial of", n, "is", fact ! Output result
end program factorial
