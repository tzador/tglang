!**This program calculates the average of an array of numbers.

!**Initializing variables
INTEGER :: array(10) !declaring array to hold 10 numbers
INTEGER :: sum = 0 !variable to hold sum of numbers
INTEGER :: count = 0 !variable to hold count of numbers
REAL :: average !variable to hold average value

!**Taking input from user
PRINT*, 'Enter 10 numbers:' !prompt user to enter 10 numbers
DO i = 1, 10 !loop to take input 10 times
    READ*, array(i) !read input from user and store in array
END DO

!**Calculating sum
DO i = 1, 10 !loop to iterate through array
    sum = sum + array(i) !add current element of array to sum
END DO

!**Calculating average
average = REAL(sum) / 10.0 !convert sum to real number and divide by 10

!**Checking for empty array
IF (count == 0) THEN !check if count variable is still 0
    PRINT*, 'Array is empty!' !if so, print message
ELSE !else, array has numbers
    PRINT*, 'The average of the array is:', average !print average
END IF

end
