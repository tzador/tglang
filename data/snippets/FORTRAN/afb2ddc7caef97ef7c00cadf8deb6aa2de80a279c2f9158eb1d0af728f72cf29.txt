Desc: This code snippet is written in FORTRAN, a programming language primarily used for scientific and engineering applications. It declares three variables, I as an integer, N as an integer, and SUM as a real number. The SUM variable is initialized to 0.0. 

Next, it prompts the user to input a value for N. If the value is less than or equal to 0, the program will jump to the label 10. Otherwise, the program will enter a DO loop, where the value of I will be incremented from 1 to N. Within the loop, the SUM variable will be updated by adding 1/I to it. This loop will continue until the condition of I <= N is satisfied. 

After the loop, the program will output the string "THE SUM IS" followed by the value of SUM. Finally, the program will stop execution. If the value of N was invalid, the program will jump to label 10 and output the error message "ERROR: INVALID INPUT FOR N" before stopping execution. The END statement marks the end of the program.
