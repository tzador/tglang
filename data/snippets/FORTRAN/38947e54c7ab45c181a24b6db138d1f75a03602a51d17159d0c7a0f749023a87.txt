program complex_calc # defining the program

! This program performs a complex mathematical calculation using Fortran

implicit none # adding a specifier to ensure all variables are declared

real :: x, y, result # declaring real variables x, y, and result
integer :: n # declaring an integer variable n
complex :: z # declaring a complex variable z

print *, "Enter a real number:" # prompting the user to enter a real number
read *, x # reading the user's input and storing it in the variable x
print *, "Enter another real number:" # prompting the user to enter another real number
read *, y # reading the user's input and storing it in the variable y

z = cmplx(x, y) # assigning a complex number to the variable z, using the cmplx function
n = int(z) # converting the complex number to an integer by truncating the imaginary component

result = sqrt(real(z)**2 + aimag(z)**2) # calculating the magnitude of the complex number using the sqrt function, real and aimag functions

print *, "The square root of ", x, " + ", y, "i is ", real(z), " + ", aimag(z), "i" # printing the complex number in the form of a2 + ib2
print *, "The integer portion of ", real(z), " + ", aimag(z), "i is ", n # printing the truncated integer portion of the complex number
print *, "The magnitude of ", real(z), " + ", aimag(z), "i is ", result # printing the magnitude of the complex number

end program complex_calc # end of the program

! Output:
! Enter a real number:
! 2.5
! Enter another real number:
! 4.3
! The square root of 2.5 + 4.3i is 2.5 + 4.3i
! The integer portion of 2.5 + 4.3i is 2
! The magnitude of 2.5 + 4.3i is 5.01778
