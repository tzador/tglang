! This is a program to calculate the volume and surface area of a sphere
program sphere_volume_area
  
  ! Declare variables
  real :: radius, volume, area
  
  ! Set value for radius
  radius = 5.0
  
  ! Calculate volume and surface area
  volume = (4.0/3.0) * pi * radius ** 3
  area = 4.0 * pi * radius ** 2
  
  ! Print results to console
  print *, "Radius of sphere: ", radius
  print *, "Volume of sphere: ", volume
  print *, "Surface area of sphere: ", area
  
end program sphere_volume_area
