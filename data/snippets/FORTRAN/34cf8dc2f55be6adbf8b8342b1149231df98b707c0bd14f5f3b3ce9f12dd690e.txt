! This code snippet calculates the value of pi using the Leibniz formula

program calculate_pi
    implicit none

    integer :: n_iterations ! variable to store the number of iterations
    real :: pi, current_pi, denominator, numerator, term, error ! variables for calculations
    
    ! Prompt user for number of iterations
    write(*, *) "Enter the number of iterations: "
    read(*, *) n_iterations
    
    pi = 0.0 ! initialize pi to 0
    denominator = 1.0 ! initialize denominator to 1
    
    ! Start loop to calculate the value of pi
    do i = 1, n_iterations, 1 ! loop from 1 to n_iterations, increment by 1 each time
        numerator = (-1) ** (i+1) ! calculate the value of the numerator 
        term = numerator / denominator ! calculate the value of the current term in the series
        pi = pi + term ! update the value of pi 
        
        ! Calculate and store the error between the current pi and the actual value of pi
        error = abs(pi - real(pi, 8)) 
        
        ! Print the current value of pi and the error
        write(*, *) "Pi after", i, "iterations =", pi, "with an error of", error
         
        denominator = denominator + 2.0 ! increment the denominator by 2 for the next term
    end do
