program quadratic_equation

! This program solves quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0
! It takes input coefficients a, b and c from user and calculates the roots of the equation

implicit none

! declaring variables
real :: a, b, c ! coefficients
real :: discriminant, root1, root2 ! discriminant and roots of the equation

! Get input from the user
print*, "Enter the values of a, b and c: "
read*, a, b, c

! Calculate discriminant
discriminant = b**2 - 4.0*a*c

! Check for complex roots
if (discriminant < 0.0) then
    print*, "The roots are complex numbers, cannot be calculated."
else
    ! Calculate the two roots
    root1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2.0 * a)
    root2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2.0 * a)

    ! Output the roots
    print*, "The roots of the quadratic equation are: "
    print*, "Root 1 = ", root1
    print*, "Root 2 = ", root2
end if
