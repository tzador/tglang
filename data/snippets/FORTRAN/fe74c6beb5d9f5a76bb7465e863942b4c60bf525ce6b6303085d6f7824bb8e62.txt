c This program calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
c Note: This version uses a DO loop for iteration

      program fibonacci
      implicit none
      integer :: n, i, n1, n2, n3

      print*, "Enter the value of n: "
      read*, n

      n1 = 0              ! First number in the sequence
      n2 = 1              ! Second number in the sequence

      do i=3, n           ! Loop from 3 to n since first 2 numbers are known
         n3 = n1 + n2     ! Calculate nth number by adding previous 2 numbers
         n1 = n2          ! Move n2 to n1 for next iteration
         n2 = n3          ! Move n3 to n2 for next iteration
      end do

      print*, "The", n, "th number in the Fibonacci sequence is: ", n3

      end program fibonacci
