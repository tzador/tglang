! This program calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula
implicit none ! explicit declaration of all variables
real :: a, b, c ! declaring input variables as real numbers
real :: s            ! declaring semiperimeter as real number
real :: area         ! declaring area as real number
integer :: i, j      ! declaring integer variables for loop counters
integer :: n         ! declaring variable for number of triangles
