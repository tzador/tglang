    ! This program calculates the sum of two complex numbers

    ! Input real and imaginary parts of first complex number from user
    print *, "Enter the real part of the first complex number:"
    read *, real_part1

    print *, "Enter the real part of the second complex number:"
    read *, real_part2

    ! Create the two complex numbers using the real and imaginary parts

    ! Calculate the sum of the two complex numbers
    sum_of_complex_nums = complex_num1 + complex_num2
