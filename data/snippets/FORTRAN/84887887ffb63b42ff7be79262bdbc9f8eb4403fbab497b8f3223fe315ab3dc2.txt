PROGRAM SUBROUTINE
C This is a sample FORTRAN code snippet for a subroutine
C Declaration of variables
      INTEGER I,J,K,X,Y,Z,W
      REAL A,B,C,D
      CHARACTER*10 E,F
C This section assigns values to variables
      I = 5
      J = 10
      K = I + J
      A = 3.14
      B = 2.5
      C = A * B
      D = 6.0
      E = 'FORT'
      F = 'RAN'
C This section prints out the assigned values
      WRITE (*,*) 'The value of I is:', I
      WRITE (*,*) 'The value of J is:', J
      WRITE (*,*) 'The sum of I and J is:', K
      WRITE (*,*) 'The value of A is:', A
      WRITE (*,*) 'The value of B is:', B
      WRITE (*,*) 'The product of A and B is:', C
      WRITE (*,*) 'The value of E is:', E
      WRITE (*,*) 'The value of F is:', F
C This section calls the subroutine and passes variables as arguments
      CALL MY_SUBROUTINE (I,J,K,A,B,D,E,F)
      END
      SUBROUTINE MY_SUBROUTINE (X,Y,Z,W,A,B,C,D)
C This subroutine adds two numbers and multiplies them with a third number
      Z = X + Y
      W = Z * A
C This section prints out the calculated values
      WRITE (*,*) 'The sum of X and Y is:', Z
      WRITE (*,*) 'The product of the sum and A is:', W
      WRITE (*,*) 'The value of C is:', C
      WRITE (*,*) 'The value of D is:', D
      RETURN
      END SUBROUTINE
