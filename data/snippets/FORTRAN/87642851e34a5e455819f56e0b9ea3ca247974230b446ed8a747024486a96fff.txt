!! This code snippet is a program that calculates the factorial of a given number

program factorial_calculation
    implicit none

    integer :: input_number ! input number whose factorial is to be calculated
    integer :: factorial ! variable to store the factorial value
    integer :: i ! loop variable

    print *, "Enter a number to calculate its factorial:"
    read *, input_number

    factorial = 1 ! initialize factorial to 1 since 0! = 1

    do i = 1, input_number ! loop from 1 to input number
        factorial = factorial * i ! multiply factorial by each number
    end do

    print *, "Factorial of ", input_number, "is: ", factorial ! print the calculated factorial
end program factorial_calculation
