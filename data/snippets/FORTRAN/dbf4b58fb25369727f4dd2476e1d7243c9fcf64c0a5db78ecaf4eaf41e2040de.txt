! Declare integer variables
integer :: i, n, sum

! Get input from user
print *, "Enter the value of n:"
read *, n

! Use 'do' loop to iterate from 1 to n
do i = 1, n
    sum = sum + i
end do

! Print the sum
print *, "The sum of first ", n , " numbers is ", sum

! Use 'if' statement to check if sum is even or odd
if (mod(sum, 2) == 0) then
    print *, "The sum is an even number."
else
    print *, "The sum is an odd number."
end if
