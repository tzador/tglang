   ! This program performs operations with complex numbers
   
   ! Define variables and arrays
   complex :: c1, c2, c3(2)
   integer :: i, j, k
   real :: x, y
   
   ! Assign values to complex numbers
   c1 = (4.5, 2.0)
   c2 = (3.0, -1.5)
   
   ! Perform complex arithmetic
   c3(1) = c1 * c2  ! Multiply c1 and c2
   c3(2) = c1 / c2  ! Divide c1 by c2
   
   ! Print results
   print *, 'c1 = ', c1
   print *, 'c2 = ', c2
   print *, 'c3(1) = c1 * c2 = ', c3(1)

   ! Loop through an array of complex numbers and perform arithmetic
   do i = 1, 5  ! Loop through array indices 1 to 5
      c3(i) = c1 ** i  ! Raise c1 to the power of i

   ! Print updated array values

   ! Calculate the magnitude and phase of complex numbers
   x = abs(c1)  ! Magnitude of c1
   y = atan2(imag(c1), real(c1))  ! Phase of c1
   
   ! Print magnitude and phase values
