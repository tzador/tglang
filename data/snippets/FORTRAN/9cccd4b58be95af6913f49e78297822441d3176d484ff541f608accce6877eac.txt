subroutine quadratic_equation(a, b, c, x1, x2)
  ! This subroutine solves a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0
  ! Input:
  !   a - the coefficient of x^2
  !   b - the coefficient of x
  !   c - the constant term
  ! Output:
  !   x1 - the first root of the equation
  !   x2 - the second root of the equation
  implicit none
  real :: a, b, c ! declare variables as real numbers

  ! calculate the discriminant
  real :: discriminant
  discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

  ! calculate the two roots
  if (discriminant >= 0) then
    ! in case of a real and distinct roots
    x1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    x2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

  else
    ! in case of complex roots
    x1 = (-b + sqrt(-discriminant)) / (2*a)
    x2 = (-b - sqrt(-discriminant)) / (2*a)

  end if

  ! print the roots
  write(*,*) "The first root is:", x1
  write(*,*) "The second root is:", x2
