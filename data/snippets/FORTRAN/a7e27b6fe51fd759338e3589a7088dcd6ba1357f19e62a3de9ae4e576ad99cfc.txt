PROGRAM QUADRATIC_SOLVER
! This program solves for the roots of a quadratic equation 
! using the quadratic formula

! Declare variables
REAL :: a, b, c, discriminant, x1, x2

! Prompt user for coefficients
WRITE(*,*) "Enter coefficient a: "
READ(*,*) a
WRITE(*,*) "Enter coefficient b: "
READ(*,*) b
WRITE(*,*) "Enter coefficient c: "
READ(*,*) c

! Calculate discriminant
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

! Check for complex roots
IF (discriminant < 0) THEN
    WRITE(*,*) "This equation has complex roots."
    STOP
END IF

! Calculate roots
x1 = (-b + SQRT(discriminant)) / (2*a)
x2 = (-b - SQRT(discriminant)) / (2*a)

! Print results
WRITE(*,*) "The roots of the equation are: "
WRITE(*,*) "x1 = ", x1
WRITE(*,*) "x2 = ", x2
