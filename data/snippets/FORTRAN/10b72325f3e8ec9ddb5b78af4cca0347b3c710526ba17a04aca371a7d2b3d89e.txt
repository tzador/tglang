PROGRAM CODE
! This is a FORTRAN program annotation, denoted by "!".

IMPLICIT NONE
! This statement enforces explicit declaration of all variables.

REAL :: pi = 3.14159
! This declares a real variable named "pi" with an initial value of 3.14159.

INTEGER :: num
! This declares an integer variable named "num" with no initial value.

CHARACTER(10) :: name = "John Smith"
! This declares a character string variable named "name" with an initial value of "John Smith".

LOGICAL :: flag = .TRUE.
! This declares a logical variable named "flag" with an initial value of .TRUE.

DIMENSION array(5)
! This statement declares an array with 5 elements.

CALL subroutine(pi, num)
! This statement calls a subroutine named "subroutine" with the variables "pi" and "num" as input.

IF (num == 0) THEN
    ! This is a conditional statement that checks if the value of "num" is equal to 0.
    flag = .FALSE.
    ! If the condition is true, the value of "flag" is set to .FALSE.
ELSE
    flag = .TRUE.
    ! If the condition is false, the value of "flag" is set to .TRUE.
END IF

DO i = 1, 5
    ! This is a DO loop that will execute 5 times.
    array(i) = i * num
    ! This statement assigns a value to each element in the array.
END DO

PRINT *, name
! This statement prints out the value of the "name" variable.

END PROGRAM CODE
! This is the end of the FORTRAN program.
