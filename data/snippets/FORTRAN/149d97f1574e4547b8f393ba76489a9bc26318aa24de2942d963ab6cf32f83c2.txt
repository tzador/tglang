! This is a FORTRAN code snippet that calculates the factorial of an input number.
! `n` is the input number, `fact` is the output factorial
! Assumes `n` is a positive integer
program factorial

! Declare variables
integer :: n, i, fact

! Prompt user for input
print*, "Enter a positive integer: "
read*, n

! Check if input is positive
if(n < 0) then
  print*, "Input must be a positive integer."
  stop
end if

! Initialize factorial to 1
fact = 1

! Loop from 1 to `n` and multiply by each number
do i = 1, n
  fact = fact * i
end do

! Print result
print*, "Factorial of", n, "is", fact

end program factorial
