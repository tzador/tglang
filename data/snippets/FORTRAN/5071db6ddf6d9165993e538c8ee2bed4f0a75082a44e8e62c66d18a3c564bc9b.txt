! This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci sequence
  program fibonacci

  implicit none

  integer :: n, i
  integer, dimension(100) :: fibonacci

  ! Get user input
  print *, "Enter the number of terms in the sequence:"
  read *, n

  ! Set first two terms of the sequence
  fibonacci(1) = 0
  fibonacci(2) = 1

  ! Loop through the remaining terms and calculate using the previous two terms
  do i = 3, n
     fibonacci(i) = fibonacci(i-1) + fibonacci(i-2)
  end do

  ! Print the sequence
  print *, "Fibonacci Sequence:"
  do i = 1, n
     print *, fibonacci(i)
  end do

  end program
