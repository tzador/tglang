program complex_numbers
  ! This program performs basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers in FORTRAN
  implicit none

  ! Define variables
  complex :: a, b, c  ! Complex numbers
  complex :: sum, diff, prod, quot  ! Results of arithmetic operations

  ! Initialize values for complex numbers
  a = (2.5, 4.3)  ! a = 2.5 + 4.3i
  b = (0.8, 1.2)  ! b = 0.8 + 1.2i

  ! Perform arithmetic operations
  sum = a + b  ! Sum of a and b
  diff = a - b  ! Difference between a and b
  prod = a * b  ! Product of a and b
  quot = a / b  ! Quotient of a and b

  ! Print results to console
  print *, "Results of Arithmetic Operations on Complex Numbers:"
  print *, "a =", a
  print *, "b =", b
  print *, "Sum of a and b:", sum
  print *, "Difference between a and b:", diff
  print *, "Product of a and b:", prod
  print *, "Quotient of a and b:", quot
