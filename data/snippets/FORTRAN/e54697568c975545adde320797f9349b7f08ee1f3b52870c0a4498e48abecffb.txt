! The following program calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function
program factorial

  implicit none ! Explicitly declaring all variables to avoid errors

  integer :: num, result ! Declaring variables to store the input number and the factorial result

  integer function factorial_calc (n) ! Creating a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number
    integer :: n ! Variable to store the current iteration of the recursive function
    if (n == 0) then
      factorial_calc = 1 ! Base case: if the input number is 0, the factorial is 1
    else
      factorial_calc = n * factorial_calc(n-1) ! Recursive case: multiplying the current number with the factorial of (n-1)
    end if
  end function factorial_calc

  print*, "Enter a number: " ! Prompt the user to enter a number
  read*, num ! Read the number entered by the user

  result = factorial_calc(num) ! Calling the recursive function to calculate the factorial of the input number

  print*, "The factorial of", num, "is", result ! Displaying the result to the user

end program factorial
