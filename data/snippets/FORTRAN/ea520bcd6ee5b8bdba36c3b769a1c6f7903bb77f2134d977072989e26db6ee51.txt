PROGRAM COMPLEX_CALCULATION

! This program calculates the root-mean-square error of two arrays of complex numbers

IMPLICIT NONE

! Declare variables
COMPLEX :: array1(10), array2(10) ! Two arrays of complex numbers
COMPLEX :: difference(10) ! Array to store the differences of the two arrays
REAL :: sum ! Cumulative sum of the squared differences

! Initialize variables
sum = 0

! Populate the arrays with random complex numbers
DO i = 1, 10
    array1(i) = (i, i+1)
    array2(i) = (i+0.5, i+1.5)
END DO

! Calculate the differences between each complex number in the arrays
DO i = 1, 10
    difference(i) = array1(i) - array2(i)
END DO

! Square each difference and add it to the cumulative sum
DO i = 1, 10
    sum = sum + (REAL(difference(i)) ** 2 + AIMAG(difference(i)) ** 2)
END DO

! Calculate the root-mean-square error
REAL :: rms_error
rms_error = SQRT(sum / 10)

! Output the result
PRINT*, "The root-mean-square error of the two arrays is ", rms_error
