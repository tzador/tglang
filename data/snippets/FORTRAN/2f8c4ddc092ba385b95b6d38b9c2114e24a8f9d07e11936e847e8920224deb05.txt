! This is a program that calculates the standard deviation of a set of numbers
! Here we initialize some variables and constants
integer :: n, i
real*8 :: sum, mean, std_dev, x, var

n = 10 ! number of elements in the set
mean = 0.0 ! mean value of the set
sum = 0.0 ! sum of the elements in the set
var = 0.0 ! variance of the set

! We prompt the user to enter the numbers
print *, "Enter the numbers:"
do i = 1, n
    read *, x ! read in each number and add it to the sum
    sum = sum + x
end do

! Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the number of elements
mean = sum / n

! Loop through the set again to calculate the variance
do i = 1, n
    read *, x
    var = var + (x - mean)**2 ! sum the squared difference of each number from the mean
end do

! Calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance
std_dev = sqrt(var / (n-1))

! Print out the results
print *, "The standard deviation is:", std_dev

! End program
end
