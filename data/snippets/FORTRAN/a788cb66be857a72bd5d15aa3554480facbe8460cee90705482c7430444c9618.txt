    !This program solves a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula

    real :: a, b, c     !coefficient variables
    real :: discriminant, root1, root2  !variables for results
    
    !get user input for coefficients a, b, and c
    print *, "Enter the coefficients a, b, and c separated by spaces: "
    read *, a, b, c
    
    !calculate the discriminant
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    
    !check if the equation has real roots
    if (discriminant >= 0) then
