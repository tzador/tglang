! Program to find the roots of a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula

PROGRAM quadratic
  IMPLICIT NONE ! Declaring all variables
  REAL :: a, b, c ! coefficients of the quadratic equation
  REAL :: discriminant, root1, root2 ! variables to store discriminant and roots
  REAL :: complexRoot1, complexRoot2 ! variables to store complex roots
  REAL :: realPart, imaginaryPart ! variables to store real and imaginary parts of complex roots

  ! Prompt user to input values for a, b, and c
  WRITE(*,*) "Enter the coefficients of the quadratic equation (a, b, c): "
  READ(*,*) a, b, c

  ! Calculate discriminant
  discriminant = (b**2) - (4 * a * c)

  ! Check if discriminant is positive, negative, or zero
  IF (discriminant > 0.0) THEN ! Two real and distinct roots
    root1 = (-b + SQRT(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    root2 = (-b - SQRT(discriminant)) / (2*a)

    ! Print the results
    WRITE(*,*) "The quadratic equation has two real and distinct roots:"
    WRITE(*,*) "Root 1: ", root1
    WRITE(*,*) "Root 2: ", root2

  ELSE IF (discriminant == 0.0) THEN ! Two real and equal roots
    root1 = -b / (2*a)
    root2 = -b / (2*a)

    ! Print the results
    WRITE(*,*) "The quadratic equation has two real and equal roots:"
    WRITE(*,*) "Root 1: ", root1
    WRITE(*,*) "Root 2: ", root2

  ELSE ! Two complex roots
    realPart = -b / (2*a)
    imaginaryPart = SQRT(ABS(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    ! Complex roots always come in pairs: a+bi and a-bi
    complexRoot1 = realPart + imaginaryPart * CMPLX(0.0, 1.0)
    complexRoot2 = realPart - imaginaryPart * CMPLX(0.0, 1.0)
