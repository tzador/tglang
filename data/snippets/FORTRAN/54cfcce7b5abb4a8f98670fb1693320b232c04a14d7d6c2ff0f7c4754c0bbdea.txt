! This is a FORTRAN code snippet.
! It calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain limit.

! Variables:
! N: integer to hold limit of sequence
! FIB: array to store Fibonacci numbers
! I: loop counter
! J: number being added to previous two numbers in sequence
! K: index in array
! L: counter for do loop

! Initialize variables
PROGRAM FIBONACCI
    INTEGER :: N, FIB(N), I, J, K
    CHARACTER(LEN=30) :: MESSAGE

! User input for limit of sequence
    WRITE(*,*) "Enter the limit for the Fibonacci sequence:"
    READ(*,*) N

! Set first two numbers in sequence to 0 and 1
    FIB(1) = 0
    FIB(2) = 1

! Loop to calculate and store the Fibonacci numbers
    DO I = 3, N
        J = FIB(I-1) + FIB(I-2) ! Calculate new number by adding previous two numbers
        FIB(I) = J ! Store new number in array
    END DO

! Print out sequence up to the limit
    WRITE(MESSAGE,10) FIB(1:N)
    WRITE(*,*) MESSAGE
    STOP

10  FORMAT(200(I3,",")) ! Format to print array

! End of program
END PROGRAM FIBONACCI
