PROGRAM fibonacci
! This program generates the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and calculates their average.

IMPLICIT NONE

! Declare variables and initialize them
INTEGER :: num_of_nums = 20
INTEGER :: i, fib1 = 0, fib2 = 1, next_num
REAL :: sum = 0.0, average = 0.0

! Print the title and initial values
PRINT *, "Fibonacci Sequence"

! Loop through the numbers to generate and print each number
DO i = 1, num_of_nums
   next_num = fib1 + fib2
   PRINT *, next_num
   
   ! Calculate the sum of the first 20 numbers
   sum = sum + next_num

   ! Update values for next iteration
   fib1 = fib2
   fib2 = next_num
END DO

! Calculate the average of the 20 numbers
average = sum / num_of_nums

! Print the average
PRINT *, "The average of the first 20 numbers is", average
