PROGRAM complex_numbers
! This program performs operations on complex numbers.
! Define variables for real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers.
  REAL :: real1, real2, imag1, imag2
! Define results variables for addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
  REAL :: sumReal, sumImag, diffReal, diffImag, prodReal, prodImag
! Prompt user for input of first complex number.
  WRITE(*,*) 'Enter the real and imaginary parts of the first complex number:'
  READ(*,*) real1, imag1
! Prompt user for input of second complex number.
  WRITE(*,*) 'Enter the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number:'
  READ(*,*) real2, imag2
! Perform operations on complex numbers.
  sumReal = real1 + real2
  sumImag = imag1 + imag2
  diffReal = real1 - real2
  diffImag = imag1 - imag2
  prodReal = (real1 * real2) - (imag1 * imag2)
  prodImag = (real1 * imag2) + (imag1 * real2)
! Display results to user.
  WRITE(*,*) 'The sum of the two complex numbers is:', sumReal, '+', sumImag, 'i'
  WRITE(*,*) 'The difference of the two complex numbers is:', diffReal, '+', diffImag, 'i'
  WRITE(*,*) 'The product of the two complex numbers is:', prodReal, '+', prodImag, 'i'
