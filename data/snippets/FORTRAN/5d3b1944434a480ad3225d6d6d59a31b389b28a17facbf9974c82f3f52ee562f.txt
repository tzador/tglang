! This is a code snippet written in FORTRAN
! It contains a complex equation to calculate the value of pi
program pi_calculation
     implicit none
     integer, parameter :: dp = selected_real_kind(15, 307)
     real(dp) :: pi, term, sum
     integer :: i

     ! Initialize variables
     pi = 0.0_dp
     term = 0.0_dp
     sum = 0.0_dp

     ! Loop through the first 1000 terms of the series
     do i = 1, 1000
          term = 4.0_dp * (-1)**(i+1) / ((2*i-1) * (2*i+1))
          sum = sum + term
     end do

     ! Multiply by 4 to get the value of pi
     pi = 4 * sum

     ! Print the result
     print *, "The value of pi is: ", pi

end program pi_calculation
