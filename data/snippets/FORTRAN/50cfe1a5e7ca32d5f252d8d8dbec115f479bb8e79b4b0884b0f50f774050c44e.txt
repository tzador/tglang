! This is a FORTRAN program that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation
program quadratic_roots
implicit none
! Declarations.
real :: a, b, c     ! coefficients of the quadratic equation
real :: root1, root2 ! roots of the equation
real :: discriminant
integer :: i, n      ! loop variable and number of equations to solve

! Prompt user for the number of equations to solve.
write(*,*) 'Enter the number of equations to solve:'
read(*,*) n

! Loop through each equation.
do i = 1, n
    ! Prompt user for the coefficients of the equation.
    write(*,*) 'Enter the coefficients of equation ', i, ':'
    read(*,*) a, b, c

    ! Calculate the discriminant.
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

    ! If the discriminant is less than zero, there are no real roots.
    if (discriminant < 0) then
        write(*,*) 'There are no real roots'
    else
        ! Calculate the roots.
        root1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
        root2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

        ! Print the roots.
        write(*,*) 'Root 1 is: ', root1
        write(*,*) 'Root 2 is: ', root2
