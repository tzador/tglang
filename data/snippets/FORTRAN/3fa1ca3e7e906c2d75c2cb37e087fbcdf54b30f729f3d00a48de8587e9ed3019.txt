! This is a simple program in FORTRAN that calculates the factorial of a number

program factorialCalculation

    implicit none         ! declaring all variables explicitly 
    
    integer :: num, fact ! declaring variables for storing user input and factorial result
    integer :: counter ! declaring variable for loop counter
    
    write(*,*) 'Enter a positive integer:' ! prompting user to enter a number
    read(*,*) num ! reading user input and storing in `num` variable
    
    fact = 1 ! initializing `fact` variable to 1
    
    do counter = 1, num ! starting a do loop to iterate from 1 to `num` value
        fact = fact * counter ! multiplying `fact` variable with `counter` in each iteration
    end do
    
    write(*,*) 'The factorial of', num, 'is', fact ! displaying the result to the user
    
end program factorialCalculation ! marking the end of program
