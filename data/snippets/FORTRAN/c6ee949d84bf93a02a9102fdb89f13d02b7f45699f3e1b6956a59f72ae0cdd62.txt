program myprogram ! Start of program
implicit none ! Declares all variables as explicitly declared
integer :: i, numOfLoops  ! Declares integer variables
real :: sum ! Declares sum as real number
character(len=20) :: name ! Declares character string with length of 20 characters
print *, "Enter your name:" ! Print statement
read *, name ! Reads input from user and assigns it to name variable
print *, "Enter the number of loops:" ! Print statement
read *, numOfLoops ! Reads input from user and assigns it to numOfLoops variable
sum = 0.0 ! Initializes sum variable to 0
do i = 1, numOfLoops ! Looping from 1 to numOfLoops
    sum = sum + i ! Adds value of i to sum variable
    print *, "Current value of sum:", sum ! Prints current value of sum in each iteration
end do ! End of loop
print *, "Hello ", name, "!" ! Prints greeting with user's name
print *, "The sum of numbers from 1 to ", numOfLoops, " is ", sum ! Prints final result
end program myprogram ! End of program
