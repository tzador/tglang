program roots
  ! This program calculates the roots of a quadratic equation
  ! with user-input coefficients and prints the results

  implicit none
  real :: a, b, c        ! coefficient variables
  real :: disc, root1, root2   ! other variables
  integer :: status      ! status of quadratic equation

  ! get input from user for coefficients
  print *, "Enter the coefficients a, b, and c:"
  read *, a, b, c

  ! calculate discriminant
  disc = b**2 - 4.0*a*c

  ! check status of equation
  if (disc > 0.0) then                   ! if discriminant is positive
    status = 1                            ! equation has two real roots
  else if (disc == 0.0) then              ! if discriminant is zero
    status = 0                            ! equation has one real root
  else                                    ! if discriminant is negative
    status = -1                           ! equation has two complex roots
  end if

  ! calculate roots based on status
  if (status == 1) then                   ! if equation has two real roots
    root1 = (-b + sqrt(disc))/(2.0*a)     ! calculate first root
    root2 = (-b - sqrt(disc))/(2.0*a)     ! calculate second root
    ! print results
    print *, "Two real roots: ", root1, root2
  else if (status == 0) then              ! if equation has one real root
    root1 = -b/(2.0*a)                    ! calculate root
    ! print result
    print *, "One real root: ", root1
  else                                    ! if equation has two complex roots
    ! print result
    print *, "Two complex roots"
