! This is a program that calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a set of data
program calculate
real, dimension(10) :: data ! declare a real array of size 10 to store the data
real :: mean, variance, stddev ! declare real variables to store the mean, variance, and standard deviation
real :: sum, sum_squares ! declare real variables to store the sum and sum of squares

! initialize variables
mean = 0.0
variance = 0.0
stddev = 0.0
sum = 0.0
sum_squares = 0.0

! prompt user to enter data
write(*,*) "Enter 10 numbers:"
do i = 1, 10
    read(*,*) data(i) ! read in data from user
end do

! calculate sum and sum of squares
do i = 1, 10
    sum = sum + data(i) ! calculate the sum of the data
    sum_squares = sum_squares + data(i)**2 ! calculate the sum of squares of the data
end do

! calculate mean
mean = sum/10.0 ! calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the number of data points

! calculate variance
variance = (sum_squares/10.0) - (mean**2) ! calculate the variance using the formula: (sum of squares / number of data points) - (mean squared)

! calculate standard deviation
stddev = sqrt(variance) ! calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance

! output results
write(*,*) "Mean = ", mean
write(*,*) "Variance = ", variance
write(*,*) "Standard Deviation = ", stddev

end program calculate
