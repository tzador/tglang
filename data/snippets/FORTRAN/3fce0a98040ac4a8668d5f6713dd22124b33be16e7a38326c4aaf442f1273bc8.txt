! This program calculates Euler's constant
INTEGER :: iterations, i ! Define variables

REAL :: e_constant = 1.0, factorial = 1.0, power ! Set values for constant and factorial

READ *, iterations ! Get desired number of iterations from user input

DO i = 1, iterations ! Start loop

    factorial = factorial * REAL(i) ! Calculate factorial using loop index

    power = e_constant ** -i ! Calculate power using loop index

    e_constant = e_constant + power / factorial ! Update e constant value

END DO ! End loop

PRINT *, "Euler's constant approximation after", iterations, "iterations:", e_constant ! Print result
