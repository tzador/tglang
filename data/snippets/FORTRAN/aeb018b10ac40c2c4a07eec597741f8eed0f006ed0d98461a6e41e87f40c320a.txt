SUBROUTINE ComplexMath(A, B, N, CNUM)

! This subroutine performs complex number arithmetic on two complex vectors, A and B, of length N.
! The result is stored in CNUM, which is also a complex vector of length N.

IMPLICIT NONE                ! Ensures that all variables must be explicitly declared

INTEGER :: N                 ! Input parameter, length of complex vectors A, B, and CNUM
COMPLEX :: A(N), B(N), CNUM(N)  ! The three complex vectors that will be manipulated
INTEGER :: I                 ! Loop index
COMMON /CONSTANTS/ Pi        ! Access Pi constant

N = SIZE(A)                   ! Sets N to the length of vector A

CNUM = (0.0, 0.0)             ! Initializes CNUM to all zeroes
DO I = 1, N                   ! Loop over N elements
  CNUM(I) = A(I) + B(I)       ! Performs addition of complex numbers
  CNUM(I) = CNUM(I) * Pi      ! Multiplies the result by Pi
