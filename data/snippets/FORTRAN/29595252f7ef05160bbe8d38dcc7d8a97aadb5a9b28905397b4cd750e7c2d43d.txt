PROGRAM complex_number_operations
    ! This program performs basic operations on complex numbers.

    IMPLICIT NONE

    ! Define complex number variables c1 and c2
    COMPLEX c1, c2

    ! Define real number variables r, s
    REAL r, s

    ! Initialize the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers
    c1 = (1.0, 2.0)
    c2 = (3.0, 4.0)

    ! Print the values of c1 and c2
    PRINT *, 'c1 = ', c1
    PRINT *, 'c2 = ', c2

    ! Addition of two complex numbers
    c1 = c1 + c2
    PRINT *, 'c1 + c2 = ', c1

    ! Subtraction of two complex numbers
    c1 = c1 - c2
    PRINT *, 'c1 - c2 = ', c1

    ! Multiplication of a complex number with a real number
    r = 2.0
    c1 = r * c1
    PRINT *, 'r * c1 = ', c1

    ! Division of a complex number by a real number
    s = 3.0
    c2 = c2 / s
    PRINT *, 'c2 / s = ', c2
