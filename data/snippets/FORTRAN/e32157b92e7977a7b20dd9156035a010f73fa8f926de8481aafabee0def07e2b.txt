! This program finds the shortest distance between two points in three-dimensional space

PROGRAM shortest_distance

REAL :: x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2
! declare the input variables as real numbers

REAL :: distance
! declare the variable for storing the shortest distance

WRITE(*,*) "Enter the coordinates of the first point:"
READ(*,*) x1, y1, z1
! prompt the user to enter the coordinates of the first point
! and read the inputs

WRITE(*,*) "Enter the coordinates of the second point:"
READ(*,*) x2, y2, z2
! prompt the user to enter the coordinates of the second point
! and read the inputs

distance = SQRT( (x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2 + (z2-z1)**2 )
! calculate the distance using the Euclidean formula

WRITE(*,*) "The shortest distance between the two points is", distance
! output the shortest distance to the user
