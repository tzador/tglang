! This is a program that calculates the surface area of a cone
! The program asks for user input for the radius and height of the cone

program cone_surface_area

  implicit none

  real :: radius, height, surface_area

  ! --- ask for user input ---
  write(*, *) "Enter the radius of the cone:"
  read(*, *) radius

  write(*, *) "Enter the height of the cone:"
  read(*, *) height

  ! --- calculate surface area ---
  surface_area = 3.14159265 * radius * (radius + sqrt(height**2 + radius**2))

  ! --- print results ---
  write(*, *) "The surface area of the cone is", surface_area

end program cone_surface_area
