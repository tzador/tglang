PROGRAM prime_numbers
c This program calculates and prints out the prime numbers between 1 and 100
c First, we declare the necessary variables
      INTEGER :: i, j, n
      LOGICAL :: is_prime

c We need an array to store the prime numbers
      INTEGER, DIMENSION(100) :: primes

c First, we check if 1 is a prime number or not
      primes(1) = 0

c Next, we start our loop to check for all numbers between 2 and 100
      DO i = 2, 100

c By default, we assume the number is prime
         is_prime = .TRUE.

c Next, we check if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and itself
         DO j = 2, i - 1
            IF (MOD(i, j) == 0) THEN
c If the number is divisible by any other number, we mark it as not prime
               is_prime = .FALSE.
c We exit the loop since the number is not prime
               EXIT
            END IF
         END DO

c If the number passes our prime check, we add it to our array
         IF (is_prime) THEN
            primes(n) = i
c We also increment our counter variable for the number of prime numbers
            n = n + 1
         END IF
      END DO

c Finally, we print out the prime numbers stored in our array
      WRITE(*, '(A)') "The prime numbers between 1 and 100 are:"
      WRITE(*, '(100(I3, 1X))') primes

c End of program
