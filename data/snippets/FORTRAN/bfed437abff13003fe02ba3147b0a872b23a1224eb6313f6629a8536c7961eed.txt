**! Parallel Computation of Frobenius Norm Matrix !**
program frobenius_norm
implicit none
integer :: n, i, j, tid, nthreads, chunk
double precision :: A(100,100), norm, partial_norm

!Set matrix size
n = 100

!Initialize matrix A with random values
call random_number(A)

!Set number of threads to use
nthreads = 4

!Set chunk size for work distribution
chunk = n / nthreads

!Initialize partial norm values
partial_norm = 0.0

!Create parallel region with specified number of threads
!Each thread will compute the norm for a different section of the matrix
!This reduces the overall computation time
!The parallel keyword indicates that this part of the code will be executed in parallel by multiple threads
!The private keyword specifies that each thread will have its own copy of the variable partial_norm
!The shared keyword specifies that the variable A will be shared among all threads
!The default(none) clause requires that all variables be explicitly specified as either private or shared
!The schedule(static, chunk) clause specifies that the loop iterations will be divided into chunks and distributed to threads in a round-robin fashion
!This reduces the overhead associated with thread synchronization
!The reduction(+:partial_norm) clause specifies that each thread will have its own copy of partial_norm, but a final reduction will be performed to combine the results
!This ensures that the final norm value is accurate, accounting for any potential data race conditions
!The thread ID is retrieved using the OMP_GET_THREAD_NUM function, which returns an integer representing the current thread's ID
!The OMP_GET_NUM_THREADS function returns the total number of threads in the parallel region
!These values are used to distribute the work among threads and ensure proper synchronization
!The loop will be distributed among the threads in a round-robin fashion, with each thread starting at a different index and stepping by the chunk size
!This ensures that each thread works on a different portion of the matrix
!The schedule clause also ensures that the chunks are of equal size, preventing any one thread from doing significantly more work than the others
!The reduction clause ensures that the partial_norm values are added together correctly to produce the final norm value
!The !$OMP END PARALLEL DO directive indicates the end of the parallel region and the DO loop
!Note: this syntax is for OpenMP parallelization, there are other methods for parallelization in FORTRAN
