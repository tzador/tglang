program main
! This is a program in FORTRAN that calculates the area of a triangle
! and prints it out to the user
implicit none          ! ensures all variables are explicitly declared
 
! declare variables for the base, height and area of triangle
real :: base, height, area
 
! prompt user for input values
print *, "Enter base of triangle:"
read *, base
print *, "Enter height of triangle:"
read *, height
 
! calculate the area of triangle using formula: (base * height)/2
area = (base * height) / 2
 
! print out the calculated area to the user
print *, "The area of the triangle with base", base, "and height", height, "is", area
