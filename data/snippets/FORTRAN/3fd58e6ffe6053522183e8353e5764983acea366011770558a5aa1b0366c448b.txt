! This code snippet is written in FORTRAN

program square_roots
  implicit none          ! prevents accidental declaration of variables
  real :: a,b,c,d,x1,x2   ! declares real variables

  print*, "Please enter values for a, b, c (separated by spaces):"
  read*, a, b, c         ! reads in values from user

  d = b**2 - 4.0*a*c      ! calculates value under square root

  ! conditional to handle imaginary solutions
  if (d < 0.0) then
    print*, "Imaginary solutions"
  else
    ! calculates and prints the two possible solutions
    x1 = (-b + sqrt(d))/(2.0*a)
    x2 = (-b - sqrt(d))/(2.0*a)
    print*, "The two possible solutions are:", x1, "and", x2
  end if
