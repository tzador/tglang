! This is a code snippet in FORTRAN that takes in two arrays of integers and computes their sum
! Declare the two arrays and their sizes
INTEGER, DIMENSION(20) :: A, B
INTEGER :: i, sizeA, sizeB

! Take input from the user for the size of the arrays
PRINT *, "Enter the size of array A (max 20): "
READ *, sizeA
PRINT *, "Enter the size of array B (max 20): "
READ *, sizeB

! Take input from the user for the elements of array A
PRINT *, "Enter the elements of array A: "
READ *, (A(i), i = 1, sizeA)

! Take input from the user for the elements of array B
PRINT *, "Enter the elements of array B: "
READ *, (B(i), i = 1, sizeB)

! Declare a new array C for storing the sum of arrays A and B
INTEGER, DIMENSION(sizeA) :: C

! Compute the sum of the two arrays and store the result in array C
DO i = 1,sizeA
    C(i) = A(i) + B(i)
END DO

! Print the elements of array C, which is the sum of arrays A and B
PRINT *, "The sum of arrays A and B is: "
PRINT *, (C(i), i = 1, sizeA)
