! This program calculates the roots of a quadratic equation
! Inputs are coefficients a, b, and c
! Outputs are the roots x1 and x2
program quadratic_roots

! Declare variables
real :: a, b, c, x1, x2, discriminant, real_part, imaginary_part

! Ask for user input
write(*,*) "Enter coefficient a:"
read(*,*) a
write(*,*) "Enter coefficient b:"
read(*,*) b
write(*,*) "Enter coefficient c:"
read(*,*) c

! Calculate discriminant
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

! Check if discriminant is positive, negative, or zero
if (discriminant .gt. 0) then  ! roots are real and distinct
    x1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    x2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    write(*,*) "The roots are:", x1, "and", x2
else if (discriminant .eq. 0) then  ! roots are real and equal
    x1 = -b / (2*a)
    x2 = x1
    write(*,*) "The roots are:", x1, "and", x2
else ! discriminant is negative, roots are complex
    real_part = -b / (2*a)
    imaginary_part = sqrt(-discriminant) / (2*a)
    write(*,*) "The roots are:", real_part, "+", imaginary_part, "i and", real_part, "-", imaginary_part, "i"
