PROGRAM complex_code_snippet  ! Program declaration statement
IMPLICIT NONE  ! Includes declarations of all variables used

  ! Variable Declaration
  INTEGER :: i ! Variable for loop counter
  REAL :: sum ! Variable for storing sum value
  CHARACTER(len=100) :: string_variable  ! Variable for storing a string, with a maximum of 100 characters
  COMPLEX :: complex_variable  ! Variable for storing complex numbers
  LOGICAL :: flag  ! Variable for storing a boolean value

  ! Initializing variables
  i = 1
  sum = 0.0
  string_variable = "This is a long string"  ! String assignment
  complex_variable = (1.0, 2.0)  ! Complex number assignment
  flag = .TRUE.  ! Boolean assignment

  ! Main code begins
  DO WHILE (i < 10)  ! Loop statement
    IF (MOD(i, 2) == 0) THEN  ! Conditional statement
      sum = sum + i**2  ! Summation calculation
    ELSE
      sum = sum + i  ! Alternate summation calculation
    END IF
    i = i + 1  ! Loop counter increment
  END DO

  ! Output printing
  PRINT *, "The sum value is: ", sum  ! Print statement with asterisk acting as placeholder for variable
  PRINT *, "The string variable is: ", string_variable
  PRINT *, "The complex variable is: ", complex_variable

  ! Finalizing program
  WRITE(*, '(A)') 'Program completed successfully!'  ! Write statement for final output message
END PROGRAM complex_code_snippet
