! This program calculates the factorial of a given number

! Declare variables
INTEGER :: num, fact, i

! Prompt user for input
PRINT *,"Enter a positive integer:"
READ *, num
 
! Initialize factorial to 1
fact = 1

! Use a DO loop to iterate through numbers 1 to num
DO i = 1,num
    ! Update factorial by multiplying it with current value of i
    fact = fact * i
END DO

! Print the result
PRINT *, "The factorial of", num, "is", fact

! END
