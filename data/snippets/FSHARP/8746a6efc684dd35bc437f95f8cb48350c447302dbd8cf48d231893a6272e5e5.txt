// This is a function that takes in two parameters 
// and returns the sum of the two numbers

let sum x y =
    x + y

// This function takes in a list of integers 
// and uses recursion to find the highest number in the list

let rec findMax numbers =
    match numbers with
    | [] -> 0 // base case, returns 0 if list is empty
    | [x] -> x // base case, returns x if list has only one element
    | x :: xs -> // pattern matching, splits list into first element x and rest of list xs
        let maxRest = findMax xs // recursively calls function on the rest of the list
        if x > maxRest then x // checks if first element x is greater than maxRest
        else maxRest // if not, returns maxRest as the highest number

// Example usage:
let numbers = [10; 2; 7; 19]
let highest = findMax numbers // highest = 19
