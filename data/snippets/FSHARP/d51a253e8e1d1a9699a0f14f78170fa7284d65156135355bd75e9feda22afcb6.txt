//Example usage of functions
printfn "The factorial of 5 is %i" (factorial 5) //Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
printfn "The 10th Fibonacci number is %i" (fibonacci 10) //Output: The 10th Fibonacci number is 55
printfn "%s is a palindrome? %b" "racecar" (isPalindrome "racecar") //Output: racecar is a palindrome? true
printfn "%s is a palindrome? %b" "hello" (isPalindrome "hello") //Output: hello is a palindrome? false
