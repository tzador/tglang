// Creates a function called 'calculate_discount' that takes in a tuple of three integers representing 
// the original price, discount percentage, and sales tax percentage
let calculate_discount (price, discount, salesTax) =
    let discounted_price = price - (price * discount / 100)
    let taxed_price = discounted_price + (discounted_price * salesTax / 100)
    taxed_price // Returns the final price after discount and sales tax have been applied

// Example usage:
let original_price = 100
let discount_percentage = 20
let sales_tax_percentage = 10
let final_price = calculate_discount (original_price, discount_percentage, sales_tax_percentage) // Outputs 90
