// This code snippet creates a recursive function, 'factorial', that takes in a parameter, 'n', and returns the factorial of that number.
// The variable 'n' represents the number for which the factorial is to be calculated.

let result = factorial 5 // calling the 'factorial' function with a value of 5

// The result variable stores the result of calling the factorial function with a value of 5, which is 120.

printfn "The factorial of %d is %d" 5 result // printing the result to the console

// This line uses string formatting to print the result of the factorial function to the console in a readable format.
