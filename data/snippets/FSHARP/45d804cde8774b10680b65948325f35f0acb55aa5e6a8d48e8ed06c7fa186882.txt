// Usage:
// Create a new calculator object
let calculator = new Calculator()

// Calculate the sum of 5 and 3
let sum = calculator.calculate "add" 5.0 3.0
// Output: 8.0

// Calculate the difference between 10 and 7
let difference = calculator.calculate "subtract" 10.0 7.0
// Output: 3.0

// Calculate the product of 2.5 and 4
let product = calculator.calculate "multiply" 2.5 4.0
// Output: 10.0

// Calculate the quotient of 12 and 3
let quotient = calculator.calculate "divide" 12.0 3.0
// Output: 4.0
