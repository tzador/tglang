//Declare a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of the squared values
let squareSum (numbers : int list) : int =
    numbers 
    |> List.map (fun x -> x*x) //Map each number to its squared value
    |> List.sum //Sum all the squared values

//Example function call
//Input: [1; 2; 3]
//Output: 14

//**Explanation:**

//- The `squareSum` function is declared, taking in a list of integers and returning an integer.
//- The `List.map` function is used to map each number in the list to its squared value, using an anonymous function.
//- The `List.sum` function is used to sum all the squared values in the mapped list.
//- Finally, an example function call is given, with an input of [1; 2; 3] and an output of 14.
