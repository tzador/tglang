// Define a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
let rec factorial n =
    if n = 0 then
        1 // Base case: if n is 0, factorial is 1
    else
        n * factorial (n-1) // Recursive case: multiply n by factorial of n-1

// Define a list of numbers to calculate the factorial of
let numbers = [3; 5; 7; 10]

// Iterate through the list and print the factorial of each number
for n in numbers do
    let result = factorial n
    printfn "Factorial of %d is %d" n result

// Output:
// Factorial of 3 is 6
// Factorial of 5 is 120
// Factorial of 7 is 5040
// Factorial of 10 is 3628800
