let rec factorial n = // recursive function to calculate factorial
    if n = 0 then 1 // if input is 0, return 1 as factorial of 0 is 1
    else n * factorial (n - 1) // else call factorial function again with input - 1 and multiply it with input

// testing the factorial function with input 5
factorial 5 // should return 120 as 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
