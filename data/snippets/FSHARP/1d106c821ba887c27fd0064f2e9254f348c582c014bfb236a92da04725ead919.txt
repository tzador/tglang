// This is a recursive function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence at a given number 'n'.
// It uses pattern matching to handle the base cases of 0 and 1, and then recursively calls itself to calculate the remaining numbers.
// The output is an integer value representing the Fibonacci number at the given input.
