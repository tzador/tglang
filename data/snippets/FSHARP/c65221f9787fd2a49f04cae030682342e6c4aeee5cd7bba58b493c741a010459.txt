// Creating a recursive function to calculate factorial

let rec factorial n =
    match n with
    | 0 -> 1
    | 1 -> 1
    | _ -> n * factorial(n - 1)

// Calling the factorial function and printing the result

printfn "Factorial of 5 is %d" (factorial 5)

(* Output: Factorial of 5 is 120 *)

// Creating a list of even numbers using a list comprehension

let evenNums = [ for i in 0..10 do if i % 2 = 0 then yield i ]

// Calculating the sum of the even numbers in the list

let sum = List.fold (+) 0 evenNums

// Printing the list and the sum

printfn "Even numbers: %A" evenNums
printfn "Sum of even numbers: %d" sum

(* Output: Even numbers: [0; 2; 4; 6; 8; 10]
           Sum of even numbers: 30 *)
