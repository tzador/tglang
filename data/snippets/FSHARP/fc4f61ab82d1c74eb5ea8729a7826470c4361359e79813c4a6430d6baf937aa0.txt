// Define a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
let rec factorial n =
    match n with
    // Factorial of 0 is 1
    | 0 -> 1
    // Use tail recursion to calculate the factorial of n-1, then multiply by n
    | _ -> n * factorial (n-1)

// Example usage
factorial 5 // Output: 120
