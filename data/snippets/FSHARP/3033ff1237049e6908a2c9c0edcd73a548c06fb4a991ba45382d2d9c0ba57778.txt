(*F# program to calculate the average of a list of numbers*)
 
//define list of numbers
let numbers = [12; 56; 92; 43; 27]

//define function to calculate the sum of a list
let rec sumList list = 
    match list with
    | [] -> 0 //base case: empty list returns 0
    | head::tail -> head + (sumList tail) //recursive case: add head to the sum of the rest of the list

//calculate total sum
let totalSum = sumList numbers

//calculate number of elements in the list
let count = List.length numbers

//calculate average
let average = double(totalSum) / double(count)

//print the average
printfn "The average of the list is: %f" average
