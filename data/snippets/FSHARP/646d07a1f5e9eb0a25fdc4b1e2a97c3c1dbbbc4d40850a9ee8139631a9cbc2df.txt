// This code snippet demonstrates a function that checks if a given number is prime

/// Function to check if a number is prime
let isPrime (num: int) = 

    let rec checkDivisors (n: int) (divisor: int) = 

        if divisor = 1 then 
            true // if the number has reached 1 as the last divisor, it is prime
        else 
            if n % divisor = 0 then
                false // if the remainder is 0, the number is not prime
            else
                checkDivisors n (divisor-1) // continue checking with the next smallest divisor

    match num with
    | x when x <= 1 -> false // numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime
    | x when x = 2 -> true // 2 is a prime number
    | x when x % 2 = 0 -> false // even numbers (besides 2) are not prime
    | _ -> checkDivisors num (num/2) // start checking divisors from half the number since it has no divisors greater than half

// Example usage
let result = isPrime 13 // result will be true since 13 is a prime number
