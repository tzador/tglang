/// Defines a function to sum elements in a list recursively
let rec sum list =
    match list with
    | [] -> 0 // Base case: empty list returns 0
    | x::xs -> x + sum xs // Recursive call: adds first element of list to sum of rest of list

// Sample list
let list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]

// Prints sum of elements in list
printfn "Sum is %d" (sum list)

// Output: Sum is 15
