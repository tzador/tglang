/// A simple function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all elements
let sumList (list: int list) =
    match list with
    | [] -> 0
    | x::xs -> x + sumList xs

// Example list to test the function
let myList = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]

// Calling the function and printing the result
printfn "The sum of the list is %d" (sumList myList)

// Output:
// The sum of the list is 15
