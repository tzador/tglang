let rec fibonacci n = 
    match n with
    | 0 -> 0
    | 1 -> 1
    | _ -> fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

// This function calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive approach.
// It first checks if n is 0 or 1, if so it returns the corresponding term.
// Otherwise, it recursively calls itself to calculate the previous two terms and adds them together.
// This results in the nth term being calculated.
