// Create a function to calculate the sum of squares of a list of numbers
let rec sumOfSquares (lst: int list) =
    match lst with
    | [] -> 0 // If the list is empty, return 0
    | x::xs -> (x * x) + sumOfSquares xs // Calculate the square of the first number and add it to the sum of squares of the rest of the list

// Example usage
let myList = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
let sum = sumOfSquares myList // Call the function with the list and store the result
// Output: 55
