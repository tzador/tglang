(* This function takes in a list of integers and
 * returns the sum of all the numbers in the list *)

let rec sumList (lst : int list) : int =
    match lst with
    | [] -> 0 // base case: if list is empty, sum is 0
    | head::tail -> head + sumList tail // recursive case: add head to sum of rest of list

// Example usage:

let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]

sumList numbers // Output: 15
