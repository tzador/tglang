(* This code snippet shows a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder *)

// Define a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder as parameters
let calculateCylinderVolume (radius: float) (height: float) =
    // Calculate the base area of the cylinder
    let baseArea = 3.14 * radius * radius

    // Calculate the volume by multiplying the base area with the height
    let volume = baseArea * height

    // Return the volume to the caller
    volume

// Call the function with a radius of 5 and height of 10 and print the result
printfn "The volume of the cylinder is %f units." (calculateCylinderVolume 5.0 10.0)

(* Output:
The volume of the cylinder is 785.000000 units.
