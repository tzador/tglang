// Define a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
let rec factorial n =
    if n = 1 then
        1
    else
        n * factorial (n - 1)

// Define a function to print the factorial of a number
let printFactorial n =

// Call the function with input 5 and print the result
printFactorial 5

// Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
