// This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of the squares of all numbers in the list

let rec sumOfSquares xs =
    match xs with
    | [] -> 0 // if list is empty, return 0
    | x::xs' -> (x*x) + sumOfSquares xs' // square the first element and add to the sum of squares of remaining list

// Example usage:
// sumOfSquares [1; 2; 3] => 14
// sumOfSquares [-1; 0; 2] => 5
