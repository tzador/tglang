(* This is a function that calculates the area of a circle given its radius *) 
let areaOfCircle radius = 
    let pi = 3.14159 (* define pi as a constant *) 
    let radiusSquared = radius * radius  (* calculate radius squared *) 
    pi * radiusSquared (* return the result, which is the area *) 
    
(* Example usage *) 
areaOfCircle 5.0 (* output: 78.53975 *)
