//Define a function that takes in a list and returns the average of its elements
let averageOfList (numbers: List<float>) : float =
    let mutable sum = 0.0 //Use mutable keyword to declare a mutable variable
    for number in numbers do //Use loop to iterate over the list
        sum <- sum + number //Add each element to the sum variable
    let length = float (List.length numbers) //Convert the list length to a float
    sum / length //Return the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list

//Example usage of the function
let myList = [1.5; 2.5; 3.5; 4.5]
let average = averageOfList myList //Call the function with the created list
printfn "Average of list is %f" average //Print the result to the console
