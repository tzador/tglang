let rec factorial n =
    if n = 0 then 1
    else n * factorial (n - 1)

// This is a recursive function in F#. 
// It calculates the factorial of a given number by multiplying it with the factorial of the number one less than it.
// The base case is when n = 0, where the factorial is 1.
// This function takes in an integer n and outputs an integer, the factorial of n.
// Example: factorial 4 = 24
