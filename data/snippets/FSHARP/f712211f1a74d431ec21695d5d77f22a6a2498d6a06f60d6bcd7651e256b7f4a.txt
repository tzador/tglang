// Define a function that takes two lists and returns the sum of their elements

let rec sum l1 l2 =
    match l1, l2 with
    | [], [] -> 0
    | x::xs, [] -> x + sum xs []
    | [], y::ys -> y + sum [] ys
    | x::xs, y::ys -> x + y + sum xs ys

// Example usage

let list1 = [1; 2; 3; 4]
let list2 = [5; 6; 7; 8]

sum list1 list2 // Output: 36
