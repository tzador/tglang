let rec factorial n =
    match n with
    | 0 -> 1
    | n -> n * factorial (n-1)
(* This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given integer 
through a recursive function. It has a 'match' expression to handle 
the base case where n is 0 and the recursive case where n is multiplied by
the factorial of n-1. *)

// Example usage:
let result = factorial 5
// Output: 120 (since 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)
