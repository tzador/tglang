// This code snippet uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number

let rec factorial num =
    if num = 0 then 1
    else num * factorial (num-1)

let result = factorial 5 // calling the factorial function with the argument 5
printfn "The factorial of 5 is %d" result // printing the result

// Output: The factorial of 5 is 120 
// Explanation: The function calculates the product of all numbers from 1 to the given number, in this case 5.
