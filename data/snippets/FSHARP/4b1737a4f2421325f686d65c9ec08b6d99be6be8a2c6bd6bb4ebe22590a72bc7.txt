(* Define a function to calculate the average of a list of integers *)

let rec average list =
    match list with
    | [] -> 0.0 // if list is empty, return 0.0 as average
    | x::xs -> // pattern match the head and tail of the list
        let sum = List.fold (fun acc x -> acc+x) 0 xs // calculate sum of the list
        let count = List.length list // calculate length of the list
        let average = float sum / float count // calculate average
        average // return average value

// Example Usage:
let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] // create a list of integers
let result = average numbers // call the average function on the list
printfn "The average is %f." result // print the result: "The average is 3.0."
