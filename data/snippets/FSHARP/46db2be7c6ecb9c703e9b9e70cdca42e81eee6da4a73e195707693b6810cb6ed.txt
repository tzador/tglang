// This code snippet uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number

let rec factorial n =
    if n = 0 then 1
    else n * factorial (n-1)
    
printfn "Enter a number to calculate its factorial:"
let input = Console.ReadLine()
let number = int input

let result = factorial number

printfn "The factorial of %d is %d" number result 

// Sample Output:
// Enter a number to calculate its factorial:
// 5
// The factorial of 5 is 120
