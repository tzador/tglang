let rec calculateFibonacci (num: int) =

// This function recursively calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number, num.
// The match expression checks if the number is 0 or 1, as those are the base cases for the sequence.
// Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with num-1 and num-2 and adds the results together.
