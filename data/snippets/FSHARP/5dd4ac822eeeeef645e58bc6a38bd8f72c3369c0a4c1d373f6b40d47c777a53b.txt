(* This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion in FSharp. It first defines a function named "factorial" which takes in a parameter "n" and matches it with either 0 or any other value. If the value is 0, the function returns 1, otherwise it recursively calls itself to calculate the factorial of the given number. *)
