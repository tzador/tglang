let rec factorial n =
    match n with
    | 0 -> 1
    | 1 -> 1
    | _ -> n * factorial(n-1)

// This function calculates the factorial of a given number.
// It uses pattern matching to handle different cases of the input.
// The function is recursive, calling itself with a smaller input until the base cases are reached.

// Example usage:
let result = factorial 5
// Output: 120
