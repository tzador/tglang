let rec factorial x =
    match x with
    | 0 -> 1
    | 1 -> 1
    | _ -> x * factorial (x-1)

// This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number.
// It takes in an integer 'x' and returns an integer.
// The 'match' keyword is used to check for different conditions of the input.
// If 'x' is 0 or 1, then the result is 1.
// Otherwise, it multiplies 'x' with the factorial of (x-1) and returns the result.
// This ensures that the function will continue to call itself with smaller values of 'x' until it reaches the base case.
// For example, if x = 5, the function will calculate 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 and return the result as 120.
