// sum function that takes in a list of integers and returns their sum
let rec sum listOfInts = // 'let' keyword defines a function in F# and 'rec' stands for recursive
    match listOfInts with // 'match' keyword is used for pattern matching
    | [] -> 0 // empty list case, return 0
    | x :: xs -> x + (sum xs) // x :: xs is used to destructure the list into head and tail, and add the head value to the sum of the tail
