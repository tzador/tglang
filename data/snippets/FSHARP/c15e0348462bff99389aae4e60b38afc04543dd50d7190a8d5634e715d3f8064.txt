// Define two functions: one to add numbers in a list and the other to multiply numbers in a list

/// Sum function
let rec sumList (lst: int list) =
    match lst with
    | [] -> 0
    | x::xs -> x + sumList xs

/// Product function
let rec productList (lst: int list) =
    match lst with
    | [] -> 1
    | x::xs -> x * productList xs
