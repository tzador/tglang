(*This function takes in two lists of integers and combines them into a new list with the sum of corresponding elements from both lists*)

let rec combineLists list1 list2 =
    match list1, list2 with
    | [], _ -> []
    | _, [] -> []
    | x::xs, y::ys -> (x+y) :: (combineLists xs ys)

/* Example usage:
let list1 = [1; 2; 3]
let list2 = [4; 5; 6]
combineLists list1 list2
Output: [5; 7; 9] */
