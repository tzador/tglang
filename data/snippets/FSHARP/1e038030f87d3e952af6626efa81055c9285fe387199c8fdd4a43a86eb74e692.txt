let rec power x n =
    match n with
    | 0 -> 1
    | _ -> x * power x (n-1)

//This function calculates the power of a number x raised to the nth power
//using recursion in functional programming style.

//Inputs:
// x - the base number
// n - the power to raise x to

//Outputs:
// The result of x raised to the nth power

//Example:
power 2 3 //returns 8
