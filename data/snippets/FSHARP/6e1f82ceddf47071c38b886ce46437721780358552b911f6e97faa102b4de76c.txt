// This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list

let rec sumEvenNumbers (listOfNumbers: list<int>) : int =
    match listOfNumbers with
    | [] -> 0 // Base case if list is empty, return 0
    | x::xs when x % 2 = 0 -> x + sumEvenNumbers xs // If current number is even, add it to the sum and recursively call function on rest of the list
    | x::xs -> sumEvenNumbers xs // If current number is odd, just recursively call function on rest of the list

// Example usage: 
let numberList = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
let sum = sumEvenNumbers numberList // sum = 12
