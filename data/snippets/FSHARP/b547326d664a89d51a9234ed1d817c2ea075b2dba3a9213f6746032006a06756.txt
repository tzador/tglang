(*Declaring a function that accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of all elements*)
let rec sumList (inputList: int list) =
    match inputList with
    | [] -> 0 //base case: empty list, return 0
    | head::tail -> head + sumList tail //recursive call, adds current element to sum of rest of list

(*Example input list*)
let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]

(*Calling function and printing output*)
printfn "The sum of the list is %i" (sumList numbers)

(*Output: The sum of the list is 15*)
