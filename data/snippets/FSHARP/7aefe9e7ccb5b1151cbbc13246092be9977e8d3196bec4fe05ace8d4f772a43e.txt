//This code snippet is written in the F# programming language
//It showcases a function that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list
//The list is provided as a parameter to the function

let evenSum (list : int list) =
    list
    |> List.filter (fun x -> x % 2 = 0) //Filter the list to only include even numbers
    |> List.sum //Sum all the numbers in the list

//Example usage:
//let result = evenSum [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] //result will be 2 + 4 = 6
