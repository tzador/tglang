(* Define a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number *)
let rec factorial x =
    match x with
    | 0 -> 1
    | _ -> x * factorial (x-1)

(* Define a list containing numbers 1 to 5 *)
let numList = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]

(* Apply the factorial function to each element in the list *)
let factorialList = List.map factorial numList

(* Output the list of factorial values *)
