(*creates a function to calculate the factorial of a number*)
let rec factorial n =
    if n = 0 then 1
    else n * factorial (n - 1)

(*iterates through a list and calculates the factorial of each element*)
let rec factorialList list =
    match list with
    | [] -> []
    | head::tail -> (factorial head)::(factorialList tail)

(*defines a list of numbers to calculate factorial on*)
let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]

(*prints the result of the factorialList function with the numbers list as input*)
printfn "Factorials of numbers: %A" (factorialList numbers)

(*output: Factorials of numbers: [1; 2; 6; 24; 120]*)
