// Define a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the elements
let rec sumList (lst : int list) =
    match lst with
    | [] -> 0 // If the list is empty, return 0
    | x::xs -> x + sumList xs // Otherwise, add the first element to the sum of the remaining elements

// Define a list of integers
let lst = [1;2;3;4;5]

// Call the function and store the result in a variable
let sum = sumList lst

// Print the result to the console
printfn "The sum of the list is %d" sum

Output:
The sum of the list is 15
