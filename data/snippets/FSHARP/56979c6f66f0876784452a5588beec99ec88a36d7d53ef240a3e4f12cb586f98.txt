//Function to calculate factorial of a number
let factorial num = 
    let rec factHelper num acc = 
        if num = 0 then
            acc
        else
            factHelper (num-1) (num * acc)
    factHelper num 1

//Function to calculate the summation of numbers in a list
let rec sumList list = 
    match list with
    | [] -> 0
    | x::xs -> x + sumList xs

//Example usage
printfn "Factorial of 5 is %d" (factorial 5) // Prints "Factorial of 5 is 120"
printfn "Sum of [1;2;3;4;5] is %d" (sumList [1;2;3;4;5]) // Prints "Sum of [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] is 15"
