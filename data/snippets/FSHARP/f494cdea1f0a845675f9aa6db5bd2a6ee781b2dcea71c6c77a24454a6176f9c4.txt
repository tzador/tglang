let rec factorial n = // define a recursive function to calculate factorial
    if n = 0 then 1 // base case: if n is 0, factorial is 1
    else n * factorial (n-1) // recursive case: multiply n by factorial of n-1

let result = factorial 5 // call the function with input 5 to calculate factorial

printfn "Factorial of %d is %d" 5 result // print the result to console

// output: Factorial of 5 is 120
