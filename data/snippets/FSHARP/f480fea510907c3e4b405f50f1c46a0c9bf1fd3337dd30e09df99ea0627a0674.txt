/// This is a function that calculates the Nth Fibonacci number recursively
/// Parameters:
/// n: integer value representing the position of the Fibonacci number to be calculated
let rec Fibonacci(n: int): int =
    match n with
    | 0 -> 0 // Base case for Fibonacci sequence, first number is always 0
    | 1 -> 1 // Second number in the sequence is always 1
    | _ -> Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2) // Calculate the Fibonacci number by recursively calling the function with n-1 and n-2

// Example usage
Fibonacci(6) // Output: 8
