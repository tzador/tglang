//Define a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers
let rec sumEvenNumbers (numbers: int list) =
    match numbers with
    | [] -> 0 //base case, return 0 when list is empty
    | head :: tail -> //pattern matching, 'head' is first element, 'tail' is rest of list
        if (head % 2 = 0) then //check if 'head' is even
            head + sumEvenNumbers tail //if even, add 'head' to sum and pass 'tail' to recursive call
        else
            sumEvenNumbers tail //if not even, ignore 'head' and pass 'tail' to recursive call

//Example usage and output:
let numbers = [1; 5; 2; 4; 6]
