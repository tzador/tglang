//A function named "calculateAverage" that takes in a list of integers and returns the average
let calculateAverage(list: int list): float = 
    let sum = List.sum list
    let length = List.length list
    sum / float length

//This is an example list of integers
let numbers = [5; 10; 15; 20; 25]

//Printing the average of the list using the "calculateAverage" function
printfn "The average is: %f" (calculateAverage numbers)

//Output:
The average is: 15.000000
