// This is a F# code snippet to calculate the factorial of a given number

let rec factorial n =
    match n with
    | 0 -> 1
    | 1 -> 1
    | _ -> n * factorial (n-1)

// The above function uses recursion to calculate the factorial
// The keyword "let" is used to create a value or function
// "rec" keyword is used to allow recursive calls
// "match" is used to match different cases and provide different outputs
// "_" is a wildcard character used to match any other value not specified
// "->" is used to specify the output of a case
// The function takes in a parameter "n" and returns an integer
// The function has a base case for when n is 0 or 1
// If neither of these cases match, the function calls itself with n-1
// This continues until a base case is reached and the factorial is calculated
