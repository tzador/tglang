// This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number in F#

let rec factorial n = // The function is recursive, taking the parameter n as input
    if n < 0 then // If n is less than 0, throw an error
        failwith "n must be non-negative"
    elif n = 0 then // If n is equal to 0, the factorial is 1
        1
    else // If n is greater than 0, recursively call the function with n - 1 and multiply it with n
        n * factorial(n - 1)

// Example usage:
let result = factorial 5 // Call the factorial function with 5 as input
printfn "%d" result // Print the result, which should be 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
