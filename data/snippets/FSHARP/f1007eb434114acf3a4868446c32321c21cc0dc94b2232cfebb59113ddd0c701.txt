(* This code snippet calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n *)
 
let rec sumOfSquares n =
    match n with
    | 0 -> 0 (* base case, returns 0 *)
    | _ -> n * n + sumOfSquares (n - 1) (* recursively calls function with n-1 for each iteration *)
 
let result = sumOfSquares 5 (* calls function with value of n as 5 *)
 
printfn "The sum of squares from 1 to 5 is %d" result (* prints result in formatted string *)
