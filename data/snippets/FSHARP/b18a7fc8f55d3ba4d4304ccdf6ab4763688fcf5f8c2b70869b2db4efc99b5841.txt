(* This function calculates the average of a list of integers  *)

let average list =
    // create a mutable variable to store the sum
    let mutable sum = 0
    // loop through the list and add each element to the sum variable
    for i in list do
        sum <- sum + i
    // calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list
    let avg = sum / (List.length list)
    // return the average
    avg 

// example usage:
let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
let result = average numbers
// result should be 3
