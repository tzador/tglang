// Define a function that takes in two integers and returns their product

// Define a list of integers

// Define a recursive function that takes in a list of integers and returns the factorial of the first element in the list

// Call the multiply function with two integers and store the result in a variable

// Print the result
printfn "The result is %d" result 

// Call the factorial function with the intList variable and print the result

// Output:
// The result is 6
// The factorial of the first element in intList is 1
