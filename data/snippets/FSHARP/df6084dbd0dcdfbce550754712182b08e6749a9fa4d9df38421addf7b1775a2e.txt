//Create a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number
//Input: num (int) - the number to find the factorial of
//Output: factorial (int) - the factorial of the input number
let rec factorial num =
    match num with
    | 0 -> 1 //base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    | _ -> num * factorial (num - 1) //recursive call: multiply num by factorial of num-1

//Example usage:
let result = factorial 5 //result = 120 (5! = 120)
