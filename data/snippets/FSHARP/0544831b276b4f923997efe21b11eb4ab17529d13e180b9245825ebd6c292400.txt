// This code snippet uses pattern matching to determine the type of a shape and calculate its area
type Shape =
    | Rectangle of width: float * length: float
    | Circle of radius: float

let area shape =
    match shape with
    | Rectangle (width, length) -> width * length
    | Circle (radius) -> 3.14 * radius * radius

// Usage example
// Creates a rectangle with width 5 and length 10
let rectangle = Rectangle (5.0, 10.0)

// Calculates the area of the rectangle
let rectangleArea = area rectangle

// Prints the area of the rectangle
printfn "The area of the rectangle is %f" rectangleArea
