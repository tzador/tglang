// Define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
let rec factorial n =
    match n with
    | 0 -> 1 // If n is 0, return 1 (base case)
    | _ -> n * factorial (n-1) // If n is not 0, call factorial again with n-1 and multiply with n

// Calculate the factorial of 5
factorial 5 // Output: 120
