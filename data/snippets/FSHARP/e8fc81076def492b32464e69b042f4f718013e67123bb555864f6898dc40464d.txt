(* Define a mutable record type with properties for a person's name, age, and occupation *)
type Person = { mutable Name: string; mutable Age: int; mutable Occupation: string }

(* Create a function to update the person's age based on a given number *)
let updateAge (person: Person) (newAge: int) =
    if newAge < person.Age then
        printfn "You cannot decrease a person's age!"

(* Create an array of Person records *)
let people = [| { Name = "John"; Age = 25; Occupation = "Engineer" }; { Name = "Jane"; Age = 30; Occupation = "Teacher" }; { Name = "Bob"; Age = 40; Occupation = "Manager" }|]

(* Iterate through the array and update ages *)
for person in people do
    updateAge person 32

(* Print updated ages *)
for person in people do
    printfn "%s is now %d years old." person.Name person.Age

(* Output:
John is now 32 years old.
Jane is now 32 years old.
Bob is now 40 years old.
