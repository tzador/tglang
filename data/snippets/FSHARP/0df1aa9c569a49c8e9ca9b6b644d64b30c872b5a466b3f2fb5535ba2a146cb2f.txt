// Define a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1 // Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
  | _ -> n * factorial(n-1) // Recursive case: multiply n by the factorial of n-1
  
// Calculate and print the factorial of 6

// Output:
// The factorial of 6 is 720
