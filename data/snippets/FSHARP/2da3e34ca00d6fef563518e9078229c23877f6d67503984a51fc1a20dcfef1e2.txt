(* This is a complex function using F# *)

let rec fibonacci n =  // creates a recursive function called fibonacci with parameter n
    match n with  // uses pattern matching
    | 0 -> 0  // matches the first case where n is 0, output is 0
    | 1 -> 1  // matches the second case where n is 1, output is 1
    | _ -> fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2)  // matches any other case where n is not 0 or 1, recursively calls fibonacci function with n-1 and n-2 and adds the outputs together

// sample output
fibonacci 6  // returns 8, since 8 is the 6th number in the fibonacci sequence
