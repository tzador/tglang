// This code snippet uses Scala's higher-order functions to create an anonymous function that returns the length of a list

val list_length = (list: List[Int]) => list.foldLeft(0)((acc, _) => acc + 1)

// The 'val' keyword declares a value in Scala, in this case it is assigned to an anonymous function that takes in a list of type Int as a parameter.

// The 'list_length' variable is assigned the value of the anonymous function. This variable can later be used to call the function and pass in a list as an argument.

// The 'list.foldLeft' function loops through the list and applies a function to each element and an accumulated value.

// The first argument in the foldLeft function is the initial value, in this case it is set to 0.

// The second argument is the anonymous function that takes in two parameters: the accumulator (here represented by 'acc') and the current element (represented by '_').

// The anonymous function simply increments the accumulator by 1 for each element in the list, giving us the total length of the list.

// To use this function, we can call it with a list of integers as an argument:

val nums = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
println(list_length(nums)) // Output: 5 

// This code snippet showcases the power of higher-order functions in Scala which allows for concise and powerful solutions to complex problems.
