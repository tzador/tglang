// Define a case class named "Student" with two parameters, "name" and "age"
case class Student(name: String, age: Int)

// Instantiate an object of the Student class
val student1 = Student("John", 18)

// Define a function named "greet" that takes in a Student object as parameter and returns a string
// The string should greet the student by name and state their age
def greet(student: Student): String = {
    s"Hello ${student.name}, you are ${student.age} years old."
}

// Call the "greet" function with the student1 object as argument
greet(student1)

// Output: Hello John, you are 18 years old.
