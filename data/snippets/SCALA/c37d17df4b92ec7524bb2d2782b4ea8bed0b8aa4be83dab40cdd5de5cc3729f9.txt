// A function that recursively calculates the factorial of a number
// Input: n - the number whose factorial is to be calculated
// Output: the factorial of n
def factorial(n: Int): Int = {
  if (n == 0 || n == 1) 1 // base case: 0! and 1! are both 1
  else n * factorial(n - 1) // recursive call to find factorial of n-1
}

// An example call to the function
val result = factorial(5) // result will be equal to 120, which is 5!
