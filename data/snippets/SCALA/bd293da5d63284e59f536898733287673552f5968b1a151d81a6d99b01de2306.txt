//Create a class called "Person" with two parameters, "name" and "age"
class Person(name: String, age: Int) {
  //Define a method "greet" that returns a greeting message with the person's name and age
  def greet: String = s"Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old."
}

//Create an object called "main" to run the code

  //Create an instance of the Person class with the name "John" and age 25
  val john = new Person("John", 25)
  //Call the "greet" method on the john instance
