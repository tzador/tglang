/*
This code snippet is a demonstration of a complex class declaration in Scala.
It includes a constructor, private and public fields, a method, and an object instantiation.
*/

//Defining the class "Person", with a constructor that takes in 3 parameters
class Person(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int) {
  //private field for storing the person's first name
  private val _firstName = firstName
  //public field for storing the person's last name
  val lastName = lastName
  //public field for storing and accessing the person's age
  var _age = age

  //method for changing the person's last name
  def changeLastName(newLastName: String): Unit = {
    this.lastName = newLastName
  }
}

//instantiating an object of the Person class with values for the constructor parameters
val person1 = new Person("John", "Smith", 30)

//accessing and printing the person's first and last names
println(s"First name: ${person1._firstName}") //should return "John"
println(s"Last name: ${person1.lastName}") //should return "Smith"
