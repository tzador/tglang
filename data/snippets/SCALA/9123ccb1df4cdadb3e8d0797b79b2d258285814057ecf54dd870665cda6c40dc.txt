//This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of the squares of all the even numbers in the list
def squareSum (numbers: List[Int]): Int = {
  var sum: Int = 0
  for (num <- numbers) { //loop through the list of numbers
    if (num % 2 == 0) { //check if the number is even
      sum += num * num //square the number and add it to the sum
    }
  }

//Example usage
val myNumbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
squareSum(myNumbers) //returns 56 (4^2 + 6^2 = 16 + 36 = 56)
