// Define a case class with three parameters
case class Person(name: String, age: Int, occupation: String)

// Create an empty list to store instances of Person
var peopleList = List.empty[Person]

// Create a function that takes a person and adds them to the list
def addPersonToList(person: Person): Unit = {
  peopleList = peopleList :+ person
}

// Create an instance of Person
val john = Person("John", 30, "Engineer")

// Add John to the list using the function
addPersonToList(john)

// Print out all the people in the list using pattern matching
for (person <- peopleList) {
  person match {
    case Person(name, age, occupation) => println(s"$name is $age years old and works as an $occupation")
    case _ => println("Invalid person")

}

// Output:
// John is 30 years old and works as an Engineer
