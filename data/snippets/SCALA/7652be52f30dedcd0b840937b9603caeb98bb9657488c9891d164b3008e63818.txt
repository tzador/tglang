// This is a Scala code snippet for finding the average of a list of numbers
// First, we define a function that takes in a list of integers and returns their average
def average(numbers: List[Int]): Double = {
  // We use the reduceLeft function to sum up all the elements in the list
  // and the size function to get the number of elements in the list
  val sum = numbers.reduceLeft(_ + _)
  val size = numbers.size
  // We return the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list
  sum / size.toDouble
}

// Now, we create a list of numbers to test our function on
val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

// We call our average function on the list of numbers and print the result
println("The average of the numbers is " + average(numbers))

// Output: The average of the numbers is 3.0
