/* Variables and Data Types */

// Declaring variables in Scala is similar to other programming languages
var num: Int = 10 // declaring a variable num of type Int and assigning it a value of 10

// Basic data types in Scala include: Int, Double, Boolean, Char, String
// Scala also has a type inference feature, so data types can be inferred if they are not explicitly specified
// This means the above variable declaration can also be written as:
var num = 10 // num will be inferred as Int

/* Functions and Control Structures */

// Functions in Scala are declared using the keyword "def"
def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = {
  // This is a function that takes in two parameters of type Int and returns a value of type Int
  return x + y
}

// Control structures in Scala are similar to other programming languages, including if/else, for loops, while loops, etc.

/* Classes and Objects */

// Classes and objects are fundamental to object-oriented programming in Scala
// Classes are declared using the keyword "class", and objects are declared using the keyword "object"
class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) { // declaring a class Person with two properties: name (immutable) and age (mutable)
  def sayHello(): Unit = {
    println(s"Hello, my name is ${this.name}") // using string interpolation to print the person's name
  }
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    // creating an instance of the Person class and accessing its properties
    val person = new Person("John", 20)
    println(person.name) // output: John
    println(person.age) // output: 20

    // calling the sayHello function from the Person class
    person.sayHello() // output: Hello, my name is John
  }
}
