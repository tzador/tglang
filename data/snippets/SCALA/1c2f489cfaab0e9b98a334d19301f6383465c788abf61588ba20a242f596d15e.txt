// Define a class called "Shape" with a constructor that takes in two integers for the shape's dimensions
class Shape(var width: Int, var height: Int) {
  // Define a method called "area" that calculates the area of the shape
  def area(): Int = {
    // Multiply the width and height variables to get the area
    width * height
  }
  
  // Define a method called "printArea" that prints the area of the shape using the "area" method
  def printArea(): Unit = {
    println("The area of the shape is: " + area())

}

// Create an instance of the Shape class with a width of 5 and a height of 3
val shape = new Shape(5, 3)

// Call the "printArea" method to print the area of the shape
shape.printArea()

// Output: The area of the shape is: 15
