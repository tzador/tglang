//This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns a list of their squares

def squareList(list: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
  //Create a new empty list to hold the squares
  var resultList = List[Int]()
  
  //Loop through the input list and square each number
  for (num <- list) {
    var square = num * num
    //Add the square to the resulting list
    resultList = resultList :+ square
  }
  //Return the list of squares
  resultList

//Example usage of the function
val inputList = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
val outputList = squareList(inputList)
println(outputList)
//Output: List(1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36)
