//This code snippet generates a list of even numbers using a for comprehension

//Define a range of numbers from 1 to 20
val range = 1 to 20

//Use a for comprehension to filter out odd numbers and generate a new list of even numbers
val evenNumbers = for {
  num <- range //iterate through the range of numbers
  if num % 2 == 0 //check if the current number is even
} yield num //add the number to the new list of even numbers

//Print out the list of even numbers
println(evenNumbers)
