// This function uses recursion to count the number of times it is called 
// and returns the count as an Int value. It takes in one parameter, num, 
// which is the number of times the function will call itself. It defines a 
// nested function, loop, which takes in two parameters, n and acc. The 
// function checks if n is equal to 0, and if it is, it returns the acc 
// parameter. If n is not equal to 0, the function calls itself with n - 1 
// and acc + 1 as the parameters. This continues until n is equal to 0, then 
// the final count is returned. To use this function, simply call it with 
// the desired number of recursive calls, e.g. recursiveCount(5) will return 
// 5.
