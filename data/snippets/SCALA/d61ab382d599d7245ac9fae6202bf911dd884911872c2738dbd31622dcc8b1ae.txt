//This code snippet will create a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
//Factorial of a number n is defined as n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1

def factorial(n: Int): Int = {  //Creation of the factorial function that takes in an integer and returns an integer
  if (n == 0) //Base case: if n is 0, then factorial is 1
    1 
  else 
    n * factorial(n - 1) //Recursive call to the factorial function, multiplying n with the factorial of n-1
}

//Example of using the factorial function
val result = factorial(10) //Calling the factorial function with input 10
println(result) //Printing the output of the factorial function, which should be 10! = 3628800
