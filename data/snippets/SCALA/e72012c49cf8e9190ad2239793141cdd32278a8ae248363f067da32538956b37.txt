//This code snippet demonstrates a complex function that calculates the factorial of a given number

//Defining a recursive function to calculate the factorial
//The function takes in an integer as input and returns the factorial
def factorial(num: Int): Int = {
    //Using pattern matching to handle edge cases
    //If the number is 0 or 1, return 1 as the factorial of both these numbers is 1
    //Otherwise, continue with the recursive calculation
    num match {
        case 0 | 1 => 1
        case _ => num * factorial(num - 1)
    }
}

//Declaring a variable to store the input number
val input = 5

//Calling the factorial function with the input number and storing the result
val result = factorial(input)

//Printing the result
println(s"The factorial of $input is $result")

//Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
