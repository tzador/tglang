// Define a case class that represents a person
case class Person(name: String, age: Int, occupation: String)

// Create a list of Person objects
val people = List(
  Person("John", 30, "Software Engineer"),
  Person("Jane", 28, "Accountant"),
  Person("Mike", 32, "Lawyer"),
  Person("Emily", 26, "Doctor")
)

// Create a function that filters the list of people by their age
def filterByAge(peopleList: List[Person], age: Int): List[Person] = {
  peopleList.filter(_.age == age)
}

// Call the function and print the resulting list
val filteredList = filterByAge(people, 30)
println(filteredList)

// Output: List(Person(John,30,Software Engineer))
