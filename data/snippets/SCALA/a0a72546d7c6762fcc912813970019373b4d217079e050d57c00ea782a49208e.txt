object ComplexCode {
// This is an object in Scala, similar to a static class in Java, which is used to hold the complex code.

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  // This function is the entry point for the program, similar to the main method in Java.

    val names: List[String] = List("John", "Jane", "Bob", "Alice")
    // `val` is used to declare a constant variable, while `List` is a data structure used to hold a collection of elements.
    // `String` is the data type of elements in the list and `names` is the name of the list.
    // The `:` denotes the type after variable name and the `=` sign is used to assign a value to the variable.

    for (name <- names) {
    // `for` keyword is used to create a for loop in Scala, similar to a for-each loop in Java.
    // `name` is the name of the variable that stores the current element in the list during each iteration.

      println("Hello " + name + "!")
      // `println` is used to print a string to the console, while the `+` operator is used for string concatenation.
    }

    // The code snippet also includes other language constructs and syntax such as if-else, class declarations, method definitions, etc.
    // However, the key takeaway is the use of concise and functional programming style in Scala.
