//This program calculates the average of the elements in an array

//Define an integer array with elements
val numbers = Array(3, 5, 8, 12, 7)

//Create a variable to store the sum of elements
var sum = 0

//Loop through the array and add each element to the sum variable
for (num <- numbers) {

}

//Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the size of the array
val average = sum / numbers.length

//Print the average
println(s"The average of the numbers in the array is: $average")
