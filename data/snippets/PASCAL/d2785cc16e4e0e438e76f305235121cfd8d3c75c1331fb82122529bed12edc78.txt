{ This is a complex code snippet in PASCAL that uses various data types and functionalities. }

{ First, we define a record type to store information about a student. }
type
  StudentRecord = record
    name: string;
    roll_number: integer;
    courses: array[1..5] of string;
    grade: array[1..5] of real;
  end;

{ Next, we declare an array of StudentRecords to store data for multiple students. }
var
  students: array[1..10] of StudentRecord;

{ Then, we prompt the user to enter the information for each student and store it in the array. }
for i := 1 to 10 do
begin
  writeln('Enter name of student ', i, ':');
  readln(students[i].name);
  writeln('Enter roll number of student ', i, ':');
  readln(students[i].roll_number);
  writeln('Enter the grades for each course (separated by spaces) for student ', i, ':');
  for j := 1 to 5 do
  begin
    read(students[i].grade[j]);
  end;
  readln;
end;

{ Next, we calculate the average grade for each student and display it. }
for i := 1 to 10 do
begin
  total := 0; { variable to store the sum of grades }
  for j := 1 to 5 do
  begin
    total := total + students[i].grade[j];
  end;
  average := total / 5; { calculate average }
  writeln('Average grade for student ', i, ': ', average:0:2);
end;

{ Finally, we search for and display the student with the highest average grade. }
highest_average := -1; { variable to store highest average grade }
highest_index := -1; { variable to store the index of the student with highest average grade }
for i := 1 to 10 do
begin
  if students[i].grade > highest_average then { check if current student's average grade is higher }
  begin
    highest_average := students[i].grade;
    highest_index := i;
  end;
end;
writeln('Student with highest average grade is ', students[highest_index].name);
writeln('Roll number: ', students[highest_index].roll_number);
writeln('Average grade: ', students[highest_index].average:0:2);
