{
This code snippet is a program that calculates the value of pi using the Archimedes method.
It takes in an input for the number of sides of a polygon, then calculates the perimeter and the apothem.
The apothem is then used to calculate the estimated value of pi.
}
program ArchimedesPi;

var
  numSides, i: integer; //declaring variables
  perimeter, apothem, pi: real; 

begin
  writeLn("Enter the number of sides of the polygon: "); //prompting user for input
  readLn(numSides); //getting input from user

  perimeter:= 1; //initializing the perimeter to 1
  apothem:= 1; //initializing the apothem to 1

  //loop to calculate the perimeter and apothem
  for i:= 1 to numSides do
  begin
     perimeter := perimeter * 2; //calculating perimeter by doubling the previous value
     apothem := (perimeter/2)/2; //calculating apothem by dividing the perimeter by 2 and then by 2 again
  end;

  //calculating estimated value of pi
  pi := (perimeter * numSides) / (2 * apothem);

  writeLn("The estimated value of pi is: ", pi); //outputting the estimated value of pi
end.
