program complexCode;

{
  This program demonstrates a complex code snippet in PASCAL
  It takes in user input and performs calculations to output a result
}

var

begin
  writeln('Please enter three numbers: ');
  readln(num1, num2, num3);

  result := (num1 * 2) + (num2 / 3) - (num3 * 4);
  
  if (result > 10) then
  begin
    writeln('The result is greater than 10.');
  end
  else
  begin
    writeln('The result is less than or equal to 10.');
  end;

  result := (num1 + num2) * num3;

  writeln('The result of the second calculation is: ', result:0:2);

  if (num1 + num2 + num3) = 0 then
  begin
    writeln('The sum of the three numbers is equal to 0.');
  end
  else
  begin
    writeln('The sum of the three numbers is not equal to 0.');
  end;

  writeln('The result of the fourth calculation is: ', result:0:2);
  
end.
