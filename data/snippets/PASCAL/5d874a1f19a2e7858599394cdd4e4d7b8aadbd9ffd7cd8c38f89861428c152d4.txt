{This program calculates the area of a circle. 
It takes the radius from user input and uses the formula 
pi times the radius squared. 
The result is then displayed to the user.}

Program CalculateArea;

var
  radius, area : real; {declaring variables to hold user input and calculated area}

begin

  writeln('Enter the radius of the circle: '); {prompting user for input}
  readln(radius); {reading input from user and storing it in the radius variable}

  area := 3.14 * sqr(radius); {calculating area using the formula}

  writeln('The area of the circle is: ', area:0:2); {displaying the result to the user}

end.
