program Sample;

var
    num1, num2, sum: integer;

begin
    { Input of two numbers }
    writeln('Enter first number: ');
    readln(num1);
    writeln('Enter second number: ');
    readln(num2);

    { Calculation and Output }
    sum := num1 + num2;
    writeln('Sum of ', num1, ' and ', num2, ' is ', sum);

    { Displaying numbers from 1 to 10 }
    writeln('Numbers from 1 to 10:');
    for i := 1 to 10 do
    begin
        writeln(i);
