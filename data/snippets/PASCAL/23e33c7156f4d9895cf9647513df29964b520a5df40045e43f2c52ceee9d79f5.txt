This is a code snippet written in Pascal.
It generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
}
program FibonacciSequence;
var
  n, i, a, b, c : integer;
begin
  write('Enter the value of n:');
  readln(n);
 	a := 0;
  b := 1;
  
  {
  For loop is used to iterate n times to generate the sequence.
  }
  for i := 1 to n do
  begin
    if i = 1 then
      writeln(b)
    else
    begin
      c := a + b;
      writeln(c);
      a := b;
      b := c;
    end;
    
    {
    This is a nested while loop to find the Nth number in the sequence.
    As the for loop executes, the while loop finds the Nth number.
    }
    while i = n do
    begin
      writeln('The Nth number in the sequence is: ', c);
      i := i + 1;
    end;
  end;
end.
