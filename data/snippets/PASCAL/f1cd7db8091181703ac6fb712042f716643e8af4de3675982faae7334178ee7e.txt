{The following code snippet is a function that calculates the sum of two integers and returns
the result. It uses a local variable to store the sum and uses the built-in 'write' function 
to display the result to the user.}

function sum(integer1, integer2: integer): integer;
var
  sum: integer; {local variable}
begin
  sum := integer1 + integer2; {calculate the sum}
  writeln('The sum of ', integer1, ' and ', integer2, ' is: ', sum); {display the result}
  sum := sum * 2; {multiply the sum by 2}
  writeln('The sum doubled is: ', sum); {display the new result}
  sum := sum / 2; {divide the sum by 2 to return it to its original value}
  writeln('The original sum is: ', sum); {display the original result}
  sum := sum mod 10; {use the 'mod' operator to return the remainder of the sum divided by 10}
  writeln('The remainder of the sum divided by 10 is: ', sum); {display the remainder}
end;
