{ This program calculates the factorial of a given number }

program FactorialCalculator;

var
    n, i, factorial: integer; { n is the number to calculate factorial for, i is for loop iteration, and factorial is the result }

begin
    write('Enter a number to calculate factorial for: ');
    readln(n); { gets user input for n }
    factorial := 1; { initializes factorial to 1 }

    for i := 1 to n do { loops from 1 to n }
    begin
        factorial := factorial * i; { multiplies factorial with the current value of i }
    end;

    writeln('Factorial of ', n, ' is ', factorial); { prints the result }

    readln; { keeps the output window open until user presses enter }
end.

{ Output Example:
Enter a number to calculate factorial for: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120
