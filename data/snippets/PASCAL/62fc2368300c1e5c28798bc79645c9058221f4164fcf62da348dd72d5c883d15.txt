program AnnotatedSnippet;
{
    This is a program that shows an example of a complex PASCAL code snippet.
    It declares variables, assigns values, and performs various mathematical operations.
    This code snippet is annotated to explain each line of code.
}

// Declaring variables
var
    firstNum, secondNum, result: integer;  // These are variables of type integer

// Assigning values to the variables
begin
    firstNum := 5;  // The value 5 is assigned to the variable firstNum
    secondNum := 8; // The value 8 is assigned to the variable secondNum

    // Performing mathematical operations
    result := firstNum + secondNum;      // Adds firstNum and secondNum and stores the result in the variable result
    result := result * 2;                // Multiplies the current value of result by 2 and stores it back in result
    result := result div 3;              // Divides the current value of result by 3 and stores it back in result
    result := result - firstNum;         // Subtracts firstNum from the current value of result and stores it back in result

    // Outputting the result
    writeln('The final result is:', result);     // Prints the final result to the console

end. // end of program AnnotatedSnippet
