This is a code snippet in PASCAL that demonstrates the use of a function and a for loop.

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. 
In this snippet, we have a function that finds the factorial value of a given number.

For loops are used to repeat a section of code for a fixed number of times. 
In this snippet, we use a for loop to calculate the factorial of a number by multiplying all the numbers from 1 to the given number.

} 

program factorialCalculation; {Name of the program}

var
	num: integer; {Variable declaration}

{Function declaration}
function factorial(n: integer): integer;
var 
	factorialValue: integer; {Variable to store the factorial value}
	i: integer; {Variable for for loop iteration}
begin
	factorialValue := 1; {Initial value of factorial}
	for i := 1 to n do {For loop to multiply all numbers from 1 to n}
	begin
		factorialValue := factorialValue * i; {Multiply current value with current number}
	end;
	factorial := factorialValue; {Return the final factorial value}
end;

begin
	write('Enter a number to calculate factorial: '); {Prompt user for input}
	readln(num); {Read input from user}
	write('Factorial of ', num, ' is ', factorial(num)); {Call the function and print result}
end.
