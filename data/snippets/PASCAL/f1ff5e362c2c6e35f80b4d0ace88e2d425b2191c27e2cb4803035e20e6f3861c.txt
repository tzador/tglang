    This code snippet is a simple program that takes in
    two numbers from the user and returns the sum of the two numbers.
}

program SimpleAddition;
{$MODE OBJFPC} // sets the Delphi compatibility mode for Pascal

var
    num1, num2, sum: Integer; // declares the variables as integers

begin
    writeln('Enter the first number: '); // prompts the user to enter the first number
    readln(num1); // takes in the input from the user and stores it in the num1 variable
    writeln('Enter the second number: '); // prompts the user to enter the second number
    readln(num2); // takes in the input from the user and stores it in the num2 variable

    sum := num1 + num2; // performs addition on the two numbers and stores the result in the sum variable

    writeln('The sum of ', num1, ' and ', num2, ' is: ', sum); // prints out the result to the user
end.
