{ 
  This program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. 
  The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number.
}

program factorial(input,output);
var num : integer; {variable for the input number}
function fact(n : integer): integer; {function for calculating factorial using recursion}

  if n > 1 then
    fact := n * fact(n-1) {if the number is greater than 1, recursively call the function to multiply by the previous number}
  else
    fact := 1; {if n = 0 or 1, return 1 as the factorial value}
end;

  writeln('Enter a number:');
  readln(num); {take input from user}
  writeln('The factorial of ', num, ' is ', fact(num)); {output the calculated factorial value}
