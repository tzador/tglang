{ A procedure that calculates the factorial of a given integer and prints the result }
procedure CalculateFactorial(number : integer);
var
  i, factorial : integer;
begin
  factorial := 1;
  for i := 1 to number do
  begin
    factorial := factorial * i;
  end;
  WriteLn('The factorial of ', number, ' is: ', factorial); { Will print the result to the console }
end;

{
The procedure can be called multiple times, each time with a different integer value
Example:
CalculateFactorial(5); { This will calculate the factorial of 5 and print the result }
CalculateFactorial(3); { This will calculate the factorial of 3 and print the result }
}
