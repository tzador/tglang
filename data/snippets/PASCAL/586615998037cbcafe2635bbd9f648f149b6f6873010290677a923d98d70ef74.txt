This is a program in PASCAL that calculates the area of a triangle
}

program area_of_triangle;

var
    base, height, area: real;

begin
    {
    Take user input for the base and height of the triangle
    }
    writeln('Enter the base of the triangle:');
    readln(base);
    writeln('Enter the height of the triangle:');
    readln(height);

    {
    Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula: (base * height) / 2
    }
    area := (base * height) / 2;

    {
    Display the area of the triangle to the user
    }
    writeln('The area of the triangle is: ', area);
