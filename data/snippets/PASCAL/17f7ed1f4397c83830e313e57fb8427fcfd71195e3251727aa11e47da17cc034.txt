{ This program calculates the factorial of a given number.
  The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number.
  For example, the factorial of 5 is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. }

program Factorial;

var
  num, factorial: integer; { declaring variables to store input and calculated factorial }
  i: integer; { loop variable }

begin
  write('Enter a number: ');
  readln(num); { getting input from user }

  factorial := 1; { initializing factorial to 1 }

  { loop to calculate factorial }
  for i := 1 to num do
    factorial := factorial * i;

  writeln('The factorial of ', num, ' is ', factorial); { printing the result }
end.
