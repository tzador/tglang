// This code snippet is a recursive function in pascal that calculates the factorial of a given number

function factorial(n:integer):integer;      // declare the function with an input parameter n of type integer and return type integer 
begin
  if (n = 0) or (n = 1) then                 // base case: if n is 0 or 1, return 1 as the factorial
        factorial := 1
  else                                       // recursive case: if n is greater than 1, call the factorial function with n-1 as the input
        factorial := n * factorial(n - 1);   // multiply n with the result of factorial function called with n-1
end;

// output the factorial of a given number

writeln('Factorial of 5 is ', factorial(5));  // output "Factorial of 5 is 120" to the console
