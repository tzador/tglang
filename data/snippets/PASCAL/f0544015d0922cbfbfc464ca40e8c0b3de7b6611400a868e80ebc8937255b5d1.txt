{
  This is a program in PASCAL that calculates the factorial of a number
  and prints the result.
}
program FactorialCalc;

var
  num, i, factorial: integer; {declaring variables}

begin
  writeln('Enter a number: '); {prompt user to enter a number}
  readln(num); {read the input and store it in num variable}
  
  factorial := 1; {initializing factorial variable to 1}
  
  {
    Using a for loop to calculate the factorial of the input number.
    The loop runs from 1 to the input number and multiplies each value
    to the factorial variable.
  }
  for i := 1 to num do
  begin
    factorial := factorial * i; {calculating factorial}
  end;
  
  {
    Printing the result using formatted output.
    The %d specifier is used to print an integer value.
  }
  writeln('Factorial of %d is: ', num, factorial);
end.
