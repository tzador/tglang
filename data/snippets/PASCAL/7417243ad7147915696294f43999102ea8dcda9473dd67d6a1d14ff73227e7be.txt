{ This program generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. }

program RandomNumberGuessingGame;

{

Before starting the game, we need to initialize the random number generator
to generate a random number between 1 and 100.

Algorithm:
1. Declare a variable to store the random number
2. Initialize the random number generator using the current system time
3. Generate a random number between 1 and 100 and store it in the variable

}

var
    randomNumber: Integer; { variable to store the random number }

begin
    Randomize; { initializes the random number generator }

    { generate a random number between 1 and 100 }
    randomNumber := Random(100) + 1;

    { ask the user to guess the number }
    Write('Guess the number (between 1 and 100): ');

    { declare a variable to store the user's guess }
    var userGuess: Integer;

    { use a loop to keep asking the user to guess until they get it right }
    repeat
        { read the user's input and store it in the userGuess variable }
        Readln(userGuess);

        { check if the user's guess matches the random number }
        if userGuess = randomNumber then
        begin
            { if the guess is correct, display a success message }
            WriteLn('Congratulations! You guessed the random number correctly.');
        end
        else if userGuess < randomNumber then
        begin
            { if the guess is lower than the random number, display a hint }
            Write('Try a higher number: ');
        end
        else
        begin
            { if the guess is higher than the random number, display a hint }
            Write('Try a lower number: ');
        end;
    until userGuess = randomNumber; { exit the loop when the user guesses correctly }
end.
