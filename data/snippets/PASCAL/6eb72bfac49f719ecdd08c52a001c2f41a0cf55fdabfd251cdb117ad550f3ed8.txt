{
This code snippet is a program that calculates the area of a triangle using the Heron's formula.
}

program AreaOfTriangle;

var
  a, b, c, s: real; //the three sides and the semi-perimeter of the triangle
  area: real; //the calculated area

begin
  writeln('Enter the three sides of the triangle: '); //asks the user to input the three sides
  readln(a, b, c); //reads the user input and assigns them to the variables
  s := (a + b + c) / 2; //calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle
  area := sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)); //calculates the area using Heron's formula
  writeln('The area of the triangle is: ', area); //outputs the calculated area
end.

Explanation:
This program first declares the necessary variables - 'a', 'b', 'c', 's' and 'area'.
Then it asks the user to input the three sides of the triangle.
Next, it reads the user input and assigns them to the variables.
Then it calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle using the formula 's = (a + b + c) / 2'.
After that, it uses Heron's formula 'area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))' to calculate the area.
Finally, it outputs the calculated area to the user.
