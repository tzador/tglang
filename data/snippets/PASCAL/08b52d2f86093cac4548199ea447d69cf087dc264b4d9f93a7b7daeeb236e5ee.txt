{This is a program that generates the sum of two numbers. 
It takes user input and then calculates the sum and prints the result.}

program SumOfNumbers; //program name
 
var //declaring variables
 num1, num2, sum : integer; //num1 and num2 store the input numbers and sum stores the calculated sum
 
begin
    writeln('Enter the first number: '); //asks user to input first number
    readln(num1); //reads the first number and stores it in num1 variable
    
    writeln('Enter the second number: '); //asks user to input second number 
    readln(num2); //reads the second number and stores it in num2 variable
    
    sum := num1 + num2; //calculates the sum and stores it in sum variable
    
    writeln('The sum of ', num1, ' and ', num2, ' is ', sum, '.'); //prints the sum result
