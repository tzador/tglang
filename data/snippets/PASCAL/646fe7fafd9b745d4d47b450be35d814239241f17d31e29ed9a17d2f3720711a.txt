{This is a program that calculates the sum of two numbers in PASCAL.}

program SumOfNumbers;
var
  a, b, sum: integer; # declaring variables for the two numbers and the sum

begin
  WriteLn('Enter the first number: '); # prompting user to enter first number
  Readln(a); # storing the user input into variable a
  WriteLn('Enter the second number: '); # prompting user to enter second number
  ReadLn(b); # storing the user input into variable b
  
  sum := a + b; # calculating the sum of both numbers and storing it in variable sum
  WriteLn('The sum of ', a, ' and ', b, ' is: ', sum); # displaying the result with proper formatting
end.
{Output: Enter the first number:
