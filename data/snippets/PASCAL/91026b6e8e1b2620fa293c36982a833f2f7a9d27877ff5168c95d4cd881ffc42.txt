//This example code is a function named "findMax" that takes in an array of integers and returns the maximum value in the array.

function findMax(arr: array of integer): integer;
var
    i, max: integer;

begin
    max := arr[0];      //Set the initial max value to the first element in the array

    for i := 1 to arr.length-1 do    //Loop through the rest of the array
        begin
            if arr[i] > max then     //Compare each element to the current max
                max := arr[i];       //If the element is larger, set it as the new max
        end;

    findMax := max;                  //Return the final max value
end;
