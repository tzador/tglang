program ArrayExample;
// This is a simple program in PASCAL that demonstrates the use of arrays

var
  ratings : array[1..10] of integer; // declaring an array with 10 elements
  i : integer; // declaring a variable used for loops
  average : real; // declaring a variable to store average rating

begin
  // getting input from user to populate the array
  writeln('Please enter 10 ratings from 1 to 10: ');
  for i := 1 to 10 do // looping 10 times to fill the array
    readln(ratings[i]); // reading input and storing it in the array

  // calculating the average of the ratings
  average := 0; // initializing average to 0
  for i := 1 to 10 do // looping through the array
    average := average + ratings[i]; // adding each rating to the sum
  average := average / 10; // calculating the average by dividing the sum by the number of ratings

  // displaying the ratings and average to the user
  writeln('The ratings you entered are:');
  for i := 1 to 10 do // looping through the array
    writeln('Rating ', i, ': ', ratings[i]); // displaying each rating with its index
  writeln('The average rating is: ', average:0:2); // displaying the average rating with 2 decimal places
end.
