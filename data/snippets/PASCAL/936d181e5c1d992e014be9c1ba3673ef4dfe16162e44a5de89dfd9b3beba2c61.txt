{ Begin a program to calculate compound interest in Pascal Programming Language }

program Compound_Interest_Calculation;

{ Declare variables }
var
  Principal_amount, Interest_rate, Time, Compound_interest, Total: real;

{ Take input from user }
begin
  writeln('Enter the principal amount: ');
  readln(Principal_amount);
  writeln('Enter the interest rate: ');
  readln(Interest_rate);
  writeln('Enter the time period in years: ');
  readln(Time);

  { Calculate the compound interest }
  Compound_interest := Principal_amount * (power((1 + (Interest_rate / 100)), Time));
  Total := Principal_amount + Compound_interest;

  { Output the results }
  writeln('The compound interest is: ', Compound_interest:0:2);
  writeln('The total amount after ', Time:0:0, ' years is: ', Total:0:2);
end.

{ Output should be:
The compound interest is: $110.47
The total amount after 5 years is: $610.47 }
