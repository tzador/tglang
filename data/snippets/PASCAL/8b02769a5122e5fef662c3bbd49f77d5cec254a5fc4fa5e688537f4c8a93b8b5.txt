{
    This code snippet demonstrates a recursive function to find the factorial of a given number.
    It uses a while loop to iterate through the numbers and a recursive function to calculate the factorial.
}
program Factorial;

var
   num, result: integer;

{
    This recursive function takes in a number as a parameter and returns its factorial
}
function factorial(n: integer): integer;
begin
    if n = 0 then
        factorial := 1
    else
        factorial := n * factorial(n-1);
end;

begin
    writeln('Enter a number to find its factorial:');
    readln(num);

    {
        This while loop iterates through the numbers from 1 to the input number
        and calculates the factorial using the factorial function.
    }
    while num > 0 do
    begin
        result := factorial(num);
        writeln('The factorial of ', num, ' is: ', result);
        num := num - 1;
    end;
end.
