{This code snippet is a program that prompts the user for two numbers and performs various operations on them.
It also uses a function to find the average of the numbers.}

program NumberOperations;

var
  num1, num2: integer; {Declare variables for the numbers}
  result: real; {Declare variable for the result}
  
{Function to find the average of two numbers}
function FindAverage(a, b: real): real;
begin
  FindAverage := (a + b) / 2;
end;

begin
  {Prompt user for first number}
  write('Enter the first number: ');
  readln(num1);
  
  {Prompt user for second number}
  write('Enter the second number: ');
  readln(num2);
  
  {Perform various operations on the numbers and store the results in variables}
  result := num1 + num2;
  writeln('The sum of the two numbers is: ', result);
  
  result := num1 - num2;
  writeln('The difference between the two numbers is: ', result);
  
  result := num1 * num2;
  writeln('The product of the two numbers is: ', result);
  
  result := num1 / num2;
  writeln('The quotient of the two numbers is: ', result);
  
  {Use the FindAverage function to find the average of the numbers and display the result}
