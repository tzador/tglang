Explanation:

This program is written in the Pascal programming language, with the purpose of calculating the factorial of a given number. 

The first line, program FactorialCalculator(input, output);, declares the program name and specifies the input and output formats. 

The next section, var num, fact: integer;, declares the variables used in the program. "num" will store the given number and "fact" will store the factorial value. 

Inside the program, the "begin" and "end" keywords specify the beginning and end of the program.

To ask the user for input, the program uses the "writeln" function, followed by the "readln" function to read the input and store it in the variable "num".

Next, the program initializes the variable "fact" to 1, as every factorial starts with a value of 1. Then, a while loop is used to calculate the factorial. The loop will continue as long as the value of "num" is greater than 1. Inside the loop, the value of "fact" is multiplied by "num" and then "num" is decremented by 1. This process continues until "num" reaches 1.

Finally, the program uses the "writeln" function again to output the factorial value, along with a message for the user. 

The program ends with the "end." keyword, followed by the closing annotation, "}", to mark the end of the program.
