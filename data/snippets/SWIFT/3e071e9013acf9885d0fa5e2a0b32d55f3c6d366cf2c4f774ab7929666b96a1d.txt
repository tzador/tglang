/* This is a complex code snippet in SWIFT demonstrating a function that calculates the total amount of a shopping cart with discounts applied */

// Define the function with two parameters, items and discounts
func calculateTotal(items: [String: Int], discounts: [String: Double]) -> Double {

    // Create a variable to store the total amount
    var totalAmount: Double = 0.0
    
    // Iterate through the items and their quantities
    for (item, quantity) in items {
        // Call a helper function to get the price for each item
        let price = getPrice(for: item)
        // Calculate the subtotal for each item by multiplying its price with the quantity
        let subtotal = price * Double(quantity)
        
        // Check if the item has a discount associated with it
        if let discount = discounts[item] {
            // Calculate the discounted amount by subtracting the discount percentage from 1 and multiplying it with the subtotal
            let discountedAmount = (1 - discount) * subtotal
            // Update the total amount by adding the discounted amount
            totalAmount += discountedAmount
        } else {
            // If there is no discount, simply add the subtotal to the total amount
            totalAmount += subtotal
        }
    }
    
    // Return the total amount
    return totalAmount
}

// Helper function to retrieve the price for each item
func getPrice(for item: String) -> Double {
    // In this example, we are hardcoding the prices, but in a real-world scenario, this price could come from a database or API call
    var price = 0.0
    switch item {
    case "shirt":
        price = 15.99
    case "pants":
        price = 29.99
    case "shoes":
        price = 54.99
    case "socks":
        price = 9.99
    default:
        break
    }
    return price
}

// Initialize a dictionary with the items and their quantities
let items = ["shirt": 2, "pants": 1, "shoes": 1, "socks": 3]

// Initialize a dictionary with the items and their discount percentages
let discounts = ["shirt": 0.1, "pants": 0.2, "shoes": 0.15]
