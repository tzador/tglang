/* This is a code snippet in Swift that calculates the average of an array of integers */

// Declare and initialize an array of integers
let numbers = [12, 34, 56, 78, 90]

// Define a variable to keep track of the sum of the integers in the array
var sum = 0

// Loop through the array and add each integer to the sum variable
for num in numbers {
    sum += num
}

// Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
let average = sum / numbers.count

// Print the resulting average
print("The average of the array is \(average)")
