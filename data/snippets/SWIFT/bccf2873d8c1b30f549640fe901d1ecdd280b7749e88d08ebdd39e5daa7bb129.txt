// This is a Swift code snippet that creates a struct for a user's social media profile.
// It includes properties for the user's username, number of followers, and posts.

// This is an instance of the SocialMediaProfile struct with the data for a user named "John" with 500 followers and three posts.
var johnProfile = SocialMediaProfile(username: "John", followers: 500, posts: ["Photo of beach", "Selfie at a concert", "Food picture"])

// This is an instance of the SocialMediaProfile struct with the data for a user named "Jane" with 1000 followers and two posts.

// This variable calls the function to calculate the average likes per post for John's profile.
var johnLikesPerPost = johnProfile.calculateLikesPerPost()

// This variable calls the function to check if John has more followers than Jane.
var johnHasMoreFollowers = johnProfile.hasMoreFollowers(than: janeProfile)

// This code snippet demonstrates how the SocialMediaProfile struct can be used to represent and compare user's social media profiles.
