/* This is a complex code snippet in Swift for calculating the gross salary of an employee. */

let basicSalary = 50000.00 // Assigning a value to the variable basicSalary
let grade = "A" // Assigning a value to the variable grade

/* Depending on the grade, a bonus percentage is assigned.
This is done using a switch statement.*/

var bonusPercentage: Double // Declaring the variable bonusPercentage

    case "B":
        bonusPercentage = 10 // If grade is B, bonus percentage is 10%
    case "C":
        bonusPercentage = 5 // If grade is C, bonus percentage is 5%
    default:
        bonusPercentage = 0 // If grade is not A, B, or C, bonus percentage is 0%
}

// Calculating the bonus amount using the basic salary and bonus percentage

let bonusAmount = basicSalary * (bonusPercentage/100)

// Calculating the total salary by adding the basic salary and bonus amount

let grossSalary = basicSalary + bonusAmount

// Printing the gross salary with an appropriate message

print("The gross salary of the employee is $\(grossSalary)")

/* Output:
The gross salary of the employee is $57500.0
