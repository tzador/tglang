// This is a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the average of all the numbers in the array
func calculateAverage(numbers: [Int]) -> Double {
    // First we declare a sum variable to store the sum of all the numbers
    var sum = 0
    // Loop through the array and add each number to the sum variable
    for number in numbers {
        sum += number
    }
    
    // Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
    let average = Double(sum) / Double(numbers.count)
    // Return the average value
    return average
}

// Example usage of the function
let numbers = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
let average = calculateAverage(numbers: numbers)
print(average) // Output: 9.0
