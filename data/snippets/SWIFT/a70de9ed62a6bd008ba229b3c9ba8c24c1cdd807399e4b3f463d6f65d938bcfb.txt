/*
This is a multi-line comment in Swift.
It is used to provide explanations or contextual information for the code.

In this code snippet, we will be creating a class named "Person".
The class will have properties such as name, age, and occupation.
It will also have methods for setting and getting the properties.

First, we declare the class with the class keyword,
followed by the name of the class and curly brackets.

Inside the class, we define our properties using the var keyword,
followed by the name of the property and its data type.
We also use the init() method to assign values to the properties upon object creation.

Next, we define our methods using the func keyword,
followed by the name of the method, parentheses, and curly brackets.
The setProperties() method takes in parameters for each property and assigns them accordingly.
The getProperties() method simply returns the property values.

Lastly, we create an instance of the class and call the methods to set and get the properties.

// Declaring the class
class Person {

    // Defining properties
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var occupation: String

    // Assigning values to properties
    init(name: String, age: Int, occupation: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.occupation = occupation
    }

    // Method to set properties
    func setProperties(name: String, age: Int, occupation: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.occupation = occupation
    }

    // Method to get properties
    func getProperties() -> (String, Int, String) {
        return (self.name, self.age, self.occupation)
    }
}

// Creating an instance of the class
var person = Person(name: "John", age: 30, occupation: "Developer")

// Setting properties using the setProperties method
person.setProperties(name: "Alex", age: 25, occupation: "Designer")

// Getting properties using the getProperties method
let (name, age, occupation) = person.getProperties()

// Printing the values
print("Name: \(name)")
print("Age: \(age)")
print("Occupation: \(occupation)")
