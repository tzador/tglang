// Example of a Swift class with properties, methods, and initializers

class Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var occupation: String
    
    init(name: String, age: Int, occupation: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.occupation = occupation
    }
    
    func introduce() {
        print("Hi, my name is \(name) and I am \(age) years old. I am currently working as a \(occupation).")
    }
    
    func celebrateBirthday() {
        age += 1
        print("Happy birthday to me! I am now \(age) years old.")
    }
    
    func changeOccupation(newOccupation: String) {
        occupation = newOccupation
        print("I am now a \(occupation).")
    }
}

// Example of creating an instance of the Person class and calling methods

let person = Person(name: "John", age: 25, occupation: "Software Engineer")

person.introduce() // Output: Hi, my name is John and I am 25 years old. I am currently working as a Software Engineer.

person.celebrateBirthday() // Output: Happy birthday to me! I am now 26 years old.

person.changeOccupation(newOccupation: "Data Scientist") // Output: I am now a Data Scientist.
