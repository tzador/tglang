/*
A function that calculates the factorial of a given number
Parameters:
- number: An integer value to calculate the factorial of
Returns:
- The factorial of the given number (an integer value)
*/
func factorial(_ number: Int) -> Int {
    if number < 0 {
        // Factorials are only defined for non-negative integers
        return -1
    }
    
    if number == 0 || number == 1 {
        // Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
        return 1
    } else {
        // Recursive case: calculate factorial recursively by multiplying the current number by the factorial of the previous number
        return number * factorial(number - 1)

// Example usage:
let number = 5
let factorialOfNumber = factorial(number)
print("Factorial of \(number) is \(factorialOfNumber)")

// Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
