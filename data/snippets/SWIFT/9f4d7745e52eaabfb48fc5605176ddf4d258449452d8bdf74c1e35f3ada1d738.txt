// This is a code snippet to find the average of an array of numbers in Swift
// Declare an array of numbers
let numbers = [3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 10]
// Initialize a variable to store the sum of numbers
var sum = 0
// Loop through the array and add each number to the sum variable
for num in numbers {
    sum += num
}
// Divide the sum by the number of elements in the array to find the average
let average = sum / numbers.count
// Print the average
print("The average of the numbers is \(average)")
// Output: The average of the numbers is 6
