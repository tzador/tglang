/*This code snippet uses a for loop to iterate through an array of numbers and prints the square root of each number. It also checks for negative numbers and outputs a message if found.
The use of the 'guard' statement is used to safely unwrap the optional value and ensures the code runs smoothly.*/

var numbers = [4, 6, -8, 16, 25]
for num in numbers {
    let squareRoot = sqrt(Double(num))
    guard let result = squareRoot else { //checking for negative numbers
        print("Invalid number")
        continue
    }
    print(result)
