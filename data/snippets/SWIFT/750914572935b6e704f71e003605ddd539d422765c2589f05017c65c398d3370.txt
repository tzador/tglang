// This is a long and complex code snippet in SWIFT
// It contains a function that calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula
// The function takes in three side lengths as parameters and returns the area as a Double
func calculateTriangleArea(sideA: Double, sideB: Double, sideC: Double) -> Double {
    // Calculate the semi-perimeter using the three side lengths
    let semiPerimeter = (sideA + sideB + sideC) / 2
    
    // Calculate the difference between the semi-perimeter and each side length
    let difA = semiPerimeter - sideA
    let difB = semiPerimeter - sideB
    let difC = semiPerimeter - sideC
    
    // Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    let area = sqrt(semiPerimeter * difA * difB * difC)
    
    // Return the area as a Double
    return area
}
// Call the function with different side lengths
let triangleArea1 = calculateTriangleArea(sideA: 5, sideB: 6, sideC: 7)
let triangleArea2 = calculateTriangleArea(sideA: 10, sideB: 12, sideC: 15)

// Print out the results
print("The area of the triangle with sides 5, 6, and 7 is \(triangleArea1).")
print("The area of the triangle with sides 10, 12, and 15 is \(triangleArea2).")
