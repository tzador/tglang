// In this code snippet, we have declared a function named 'sumOfOddNumbers' that takes in an array of integers and returns the sum of all odd numbers in the array. Inside the function, we declare a variable 'sum' to store the sum of odd numbers. Then, we use a for loop to iterate through each number in the array. Inside the loop, we use an if statement to check if the number is odd by using the modulo operator to check if the remainder when divided by 2 is not equal to 0. If the number is odd, we add it to the sum variable. Finally, we return the sum of odd numbers. We can use this function by passing in an array of numbers and storing the result in a variable, and then printing the variable to see the output.
