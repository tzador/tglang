//This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

func factorial(number: Int) -> Int {
    //Check if number is equal to 0 or 1
    if number == 0 || number == 1 {
        return 1
    }
    //Initialize a variable to store the result
    var result = 1
    //Use a for loop to calculate the factorial
    for i in 2...number {
        //Multiply result by current number
        result *= i
    }
    //Return the result
    return result
}

//Call the function and print the output
let number = 5
let result = factorial(number: number)
print("The factorial of \(number) is \(result)")

//Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
