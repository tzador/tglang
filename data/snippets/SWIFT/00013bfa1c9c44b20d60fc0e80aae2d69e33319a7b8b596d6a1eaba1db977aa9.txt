// This is a code snippet in SWIFT that generates a nested dictionary

let people = [
    "John": [
        "age": 25,
        "height": 175,
        "weight": 70,
        "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking"]

    "Mary": [
        "age": 30,

        "weight": 60,
        "hobbies": ["painting", "dancing"]

// The code above creates a dictionary called 'people' with three key-value pairs.
// Each value is a nested dictionary containing attributes like age, height, weight, and hobbies of the person.

// To access the information of a specific person, you can use dot notation like so:
people["John"]?.age // this will output 25

// You can also loop through the dictionary to get information of all the people:
for (person, info) in people {
    print("\(person)'s height is \(info["height"] ?? 0)cm and their hobbies are \(info["hobbies"] ?? [])")
}

// Output:
// John's height is 175cm and their hobbies are ["reading", "hiking"]
// Mary's height is 165cm and their hobbies are ["painting", "dancing"]
// David's height is 180cm and their hobbies are ["photography", "cooking"]
