// This is a comment in SWIFT that will not affect the code
// This code snippet creates an array of strings and a dictionary of integers
// The array will store names of people and the dictionary will store their corresponding ages

var names = ["Samantha", "Ben", "Emily", "Max"]
var ages = [String: Int]()

// Loop through the array and add names and ages to the dictionary
for name in names {
    switch name { // Use switch statement to handle different cases
    case "Samantha": // If name is Samantha, set age to 26
        ages[name] = 26
    case "Ben": // If name is Ben, set age to 30
        ages[name] = 30
    case "Emily": // If name is Emily, set age to 24
        ages[name] = 24
    default: // If name is not found, set age to 0
        ages[name] = 0
    }
}

// Print out the dictionary of ages
for (name, age) in ages {
    print("\(name) is \(age) years old")

// Output: 
// Samantha is 26 years old
// Ben is 30 years old
// Emily is 24 years old
// Max is 0 years old
