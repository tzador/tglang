//This is a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the average of all the numbers in the array
func calculateAverage(arr: [Int]) -> Float {
    //Initialize a variable to store the total sum
    var totalSum = 0
    //Loop through the array and add each number to the total sum
    for number in arr {
        totalSum += number
    }
    //Calculate the average by dividing the total sum by the number of numbers in the array
    let average = Float(totalSum) / Float(arr.count)
    //Return the average
    return average
}

//Example usage of the function
let numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
let average = calculateAverage(arr: numbers) //outputs 15.0
