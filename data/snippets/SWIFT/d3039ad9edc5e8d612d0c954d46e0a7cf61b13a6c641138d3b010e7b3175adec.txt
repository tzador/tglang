// First we declare a function that takes in two parameters, a and b, both of type Int
func calculateSquareDifference(a: Int, b: Int) {
    // We declare two variables, sumOfSquares and squareOfSums, both starting at 0
    var sumOfSquares = 0
    var squareOfSums = 0
    // We then loop through a range of numbers between a and b, including both ends
    for i in a...b {
        // We add the squared value of i to the sumOfSquares variable
        sumOfSquares = sumOfSquares + (i*i)
        // We also add i to the squareOfSums variable, which will later be squared
        squareOfSums = squareOfSums + i
    }
    // Now we square the value of squareOfSums
    squareOfSums = squareOfSums * squareOfSums
    // Finally, we calculate the difference between the sumOfSquares and squareOfSums
    let difference = sumOfSquares - squareOfSums
    // Print out the value of difference
    print("The square difference between \(a) and \(b) is \(difference)")
