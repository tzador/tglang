// This function returns the average of two numbers
func average(_ num1: Int, _ num2: Int) -> Int {
    let sum = num1 + num2
    return sum / 2 // dividing by 2 to get average
}

// Creating an array of numbers
let numbers = [1, 5, 9, 12, 25, 30]

// Iterating through the array and printing the average of each pair
for i in 0..<numbers.count - 1 { // Iterating through all but the last number in the array
    let averageNum = average(numbers[i], numbers[i+1])

}

// Output:
// The average of 1 and 5 is 3
// The average of 5 and 9 is 7
// The average of 9 and 12 is 10
// The average of 12 and 25 is 18
// The average of 25 and 30 is 27
