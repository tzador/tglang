// This is an example of a complex function in SWIFT that calculates the average of an array of integers and returns a tuple containing the average and the number of elements in the array.
 
func calculateAverage(of array: [Int]) -> (average: Double, numberOfElements: Int){
 
    // Initializing variables to store the total sum and number of elements in the array
    var totalSum = 0
    var numberOfElements = 0
 
    // Looping through the array and calculating the total sum and number of elements
    for element in array{
        totalSum += element
        numberOfElements += 1
    }
 
    // Calculating the average by dividing the total sum by the number of elements
    let average = Double(totalSum) / Double(numberOfElements)
 
    // Returning the average and number of elements as a tuple
    return (average, numberOfElements)
}
 
// Example usage of the function with an array of integers
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let result = calculateAverage(of: numbers)

// Printing the result
print("The average of the array is: \(result.average) and there are \(result.numberOfElements) elements in the array.")

// Output:
// The average of the array is: 3.0 and there are 5 elements in the array.
