// This code snippet creates a function that takes in two integers as parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers.

func addTwoNumbers(num1: Int, num2: Int) -> Int {
    return num1 + num2
}

// The function can be called with any two integers and will perform the necessary addition.

let sum = addTwoNumbers(num1: 5, num2: 10)

// The variable 'sum' will store the returned value of the function, which in this case is 15.
