// This is a complex function that calculates the average of an array of numbers
func calculateAverage(_ numbers: [Int]) -> Double {
    // Creating a variable to hold the total sum of numbers
    var totalSum = 0
    // Using a for-in loop to iterate through the array
    for num in numbers {
        // Adding each number to the total sum
        totalSum += num
    }
    // Dividing the total sum by the number of elements in the array to get the average
    let average = Double(totalSum) / Double(numbers.count)
    // Returning the calculated average
    return average
}
// Example usage:
let numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
let average = calculateAverage(numbers)
print("The average of the numbers is: \\(average)")
// Output: The average of the numbers is: 15.0
