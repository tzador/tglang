// This is a sample code snippet in SWIFT
var n = 6
var fib = [1, 1] // Initialize an array with first two terms of fibonacci sequence

for i in 2..<n { // Loop from third term to the nth term
    fib.append(fib[i-1]+fib[i-2]) // Appending new term to the array
}

print("The \(n)th term of the fibonacci sequence is \(fib[n-1])") // Printing the nth term
