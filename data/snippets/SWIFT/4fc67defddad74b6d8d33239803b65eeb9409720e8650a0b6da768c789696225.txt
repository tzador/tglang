//This is a complex code snippet in SWIFT
//It contains a function that calculates the mean of an array of numbers
//The function also has a parameter for optional exclusion of certain numbers from the array
func calculateMean(of numbers: [Double], excluding excludedNumbers: [Double]? = nil) -> Double {
    //Initialize a variable to hold the sum of all numbers in the array
    var sum = 0.0
    //Initialize a variable to hold the number of elements in the array
    var count = 0
    //Loop through the array of numbers
    for number in numbers {
        //Check if the excludedNumbers parameter has been passed in
        if let excluded = excludedNumbers {
            //Check if the current number is in the excludedNumbers array
            if excluded.contains(number) {
                //If it is, skip adding it to the sum and do not increment the count
                continue
            }
        }
        //Add the current number to the sum
        sum += number
        //Increment the count by 1
        count += 1
    }
    //Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the total number of elements
    let mean = sum / Double(count)
    //Return the mean
    return mean
}

//Example usage of the calculateMean function
let numbers = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7]
let exclusion = [2.2, 4.4, 6.6]
let mean = calculateMean(of: numbers, excluding: exclusion)
print("The mean of the array is \(mean)")

//Output: The mean of the array is 4.4
