//This code snippet creates a class called 'Person' with properties for name, age, and occupation
class Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var occupation: String
    
    //Initializer method to set initial values for properties
    init(name: String, age: Int, occupation: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.occupation = occupation
    }
    
    //Method to print a personal greeting
    func greeting() {
        print("Hello, my name is \(name) and I am \(age) years old. I work as a \(occupation).")
    }
}

//Creating an instance of 'Person' class
var john = Person(name: "John Smith", age: 35, occupation: "Software Engineer")

//Calling the 'greeting' method on the 'john' instance
john.greeting()

//Output: Hello, my name is John Smith and I am 35 years old. I work as a Software Engineer.
