//This is a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array

func sumArray(numbers: [Int])-> Int {
    var total = 0 //initialize a variable to hold the sum
    for num in numbers { //loop through the array
        total += num // add each number in the array to the total variable
    }
    return total //return the total sum
}

//Example usage
let array = [5, 10, 15, 20] //create an array
let sum = sumArray(numbers: array) //call the sumArray function, passing in the array as an argument
print(sum) //outputs 50, the sum of all the numbers in the array
