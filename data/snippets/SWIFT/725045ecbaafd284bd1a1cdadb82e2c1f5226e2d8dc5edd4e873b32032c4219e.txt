// This is a complex code snippet in SWIFT that uses a dictionary data type and multiple functions to perform calculations and output data.
let grades = ["John": 90, "Emily": 80, "Tyler": 70, "Sophia": 95] // Dictionary with students' names and grades

// Function to calculate the average grade
func calculateAverage(grades: [String: Int]) -> Double {
    var sum = 0 // Variable to store the sum of all grades
    for grade in grades.values { // Loop through the values in the dictionary
        sum += grade // Add each grade to the sum
    }
    return Double(sum) / Double(grades.count) // Calculate and return the average grade
}

// Function to find the student with the highest grade
func findHighestGrade(grades: [String: Int]) -> (String, Int) {
    var highestGrade: (String, Int) = ("", 0) // Tuple to store the name and grade of the student with the highest grade
    for (name, grade) in grades { // Loop through the key-value pairs in the dictionary
        if grade > highestGrade.1 { // Check if the current grade is higher than the highest grade stored in the tuple
            highestGrade = (name, grade) // Update the tuple with the new highest grade
        }
    }
    return highestGrade // Return the tuple with the highest grade
}

// Function to print the results
func printResults(grades: [String: Int]) {
    let averageGrade = calculateAverage(grades: grades) // Call the calculateAverage function
    let highestGrade = findHighestGrade(grades: grades) // Call the findHighestGrade function
    print("The average grade is \(averageGrade).") // Print the average grade
    print("The highest grade is \(highestGrade.1) earned by \(highestGrade.0).") // Print the highest grade and the student who earned it
}

printResults(grades: grades) // Call the printResults function to print the results.
