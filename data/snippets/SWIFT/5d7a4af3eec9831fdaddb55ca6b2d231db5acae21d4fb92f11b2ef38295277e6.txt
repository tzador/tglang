// This is a long and complex code snippet in SWIFT

// Declare a struct named 'Person'

struct Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var jobTitle: String?
    let country: String = "United States"
    
    // Define a function to print the person's information
    
    func printInfo() {
        if let title = jobTitle {
            print("\(name) is \(age) years old and works as a \(title) in \(country).")
        } else {
            print("\(name) is \(age) years old and lives in \(country).")
        }
    }
}

// Create an instance of the 'Person' struct

let john = Person(name: "John", age: 30, jobTitle: "Software Engineer")

// Call the 'printInfo()' function on the 'john' instance

john.printInfo()

// Output: John is 30 years old and works as a Software Engineer in United States.
