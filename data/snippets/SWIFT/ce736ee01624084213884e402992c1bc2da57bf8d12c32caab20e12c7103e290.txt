// This code snippet is a function that calculates the average of an array of integers
func calculateAverage(of array: [Int]) -> Int {
    // Declaring a variable to hold the sum of all elements in the array
    var sum = 0
    // Looping through the array and adding each element to the sum variable
    for element in array {
        sum += element
    }
    // Calculating the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
    let average = sum / array.count
    // Returning the average as an integer
    return average
}
// Example input array
let numbers = [4, 8, 10, 13, 4, 3]
// Calling the function and passing in the input array as an argument
let result = calculateAverage(of: numbers)
// Printing the result
print(result)
