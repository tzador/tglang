// Defining a struct for a car
struct Car {
    var brand: String // Property for brand of the car
    let model: String // Property for model of the car
    var color: String // Property for color of the car
    var speed: Double // Property for current speed of the car
    
    // Method to accelerate the car by a given amount
    mutating func accelerate(by amount: Double) {
        speed += amount // Increase speed by given amount
        print("The car accelerated by \(amount) and is now going \(speed) km/h.")
    }
    
    // Method to brake the car by a given amount
    mutating func brake(by amount: Double) {
        speed -= amount // Decrease speed by given amount
        print("The car braked by \(amount) and is now going \(speed) km/h.")
    }
}

// Creating an instance of the Car struct
var myCar = Car(brand: "Toyota", model: "Camry", color: "Red", speed: 60)

// Accelerating the car
myCar.accelerate(by: 20)
// Output: The car accelerated by 20 and is now going 80 km/h.

// Braking the car
myCar.brake(by: 40)
// Output: The car braked by 40 and is now going 40 km/h.
