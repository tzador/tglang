//Defining a complex data type named "Person"
struct Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var occupation: String
    //Defining a function to introduce the person
    func introduce() {
        print("Hi, my name is \(name). I am \(age) years old and I work as a \(occupation).")
    }
    //Defining a mutating function to update the person's age
    mutating func updateAge(_ newAge: Int) {

    }
}

//Creating an instance of the Person struct
var person1 = Person(name: "John", age: 25, occupation: "Software Engineer")

//Calling the introduction function on the person
person1.introduce()

//Output:
//Hi, my name is John. I am 25 years old and I work as a Software Engineer.

//Calling the updateAge function on the person
person1.updateAge(30)

//Output:
//My age has been updated to 30.
