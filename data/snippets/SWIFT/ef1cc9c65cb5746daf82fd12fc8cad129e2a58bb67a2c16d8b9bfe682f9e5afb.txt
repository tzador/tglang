///Example of a complex code snippet in SWIFT
//Define a class called Car
class Car {
    //Properties of Car class
    var make: String
    var model: String
    var color: String
    var speed: Int

    //Initializer for Car class
    init(make: String, model: String, color: String, speed: Int) {
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.speed = speed
    }

    //Function to start the car's engine
    func startEngine() {
        print("Starting engine...")
        //Code for starting the engine
        print("Engine started!")
    }

    //Function to drive the car
    func drive() {
        print("Driving \(make) \(model) at \(speed) mph...")
        //Code for driving the car
    }

    //Function to stop the car
    func stop() {
        print("Stopping \(make) \(model)...")
        //Code for stopping the car
    }
}

//Create an instance of Car class
let myCar = Car(make: "Ford", model: "Mustang", color: "Red", speed: 100)

//Call functions to start, drive, and stop the car
myCar.startEngine()
myCar.drive()
myCar.stop()

//Output:
//Starting engine...
//Engine started!
//Driving Ford Mustang at 100 mph...
//Stopping Ford Mustang...
