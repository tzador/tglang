// This is a function to calculate the average of an array of numbers
// Input: numbers - an array of numbers
// Output: average - the calculated average of the numbers in the array
func calculateAverage(numbers: [Double]) -> Double {
    // initialize a variable to hold the sum of all the numbers
    var sum = 0.0
    // loop through the array and add each number to the sum variable
    for number in numbers {
        sum += number
    }
    // divide the sum by the total number of elements in the array to get the average
    let average = sum / Double(numbers.count)

// sample input array of numbers
let numbers = [1.5, 2.8, 4.2, 6.1, 9.4]

// call the calculateAverage function with the input array
let average = calculateAverage(numbers: numbers)

// print the calculated average to the console
print("The average of the numbers is: \(average)")

// Output:
// the average of the numbers is: 4.0
