/* This is a code snippet in SWIFT that creates a function called "calculateSpeed" that takes in two parameters, distance and time.
The function then uses these parameters to calculate the speed in meters per second.

Parameters:
    distance - the distance traveled in meters
    time - the time taken in seconds

Returns:
    the calculated speed in meters per second
*/

func calculateSpeed(distance: Double, time: Double) -> Double {
    let speed = distance / time // calculates the speed using the formula: distance / time
    return speed // returns the calculated speed
}

// Example usage:
let distance = 100.0 // distance in meters
let time = 10.0 // time in seconds

let speed = calculateSpeed(distance: distance, time: time) // calls the calculateSpeed function and passes in the distance and time variables
print("The speed is \(speed) meters per second") // prints the calculated speed
