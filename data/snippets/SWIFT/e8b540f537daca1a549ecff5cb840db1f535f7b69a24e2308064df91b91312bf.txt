//This code snippet uses a for loop to generate a fibonacci sequence
//The variable "n" represents the number of terms in the sequence

var first = 0 //initializing first term as 0
var second = 1 //initializing second term as 1
var next = first + second //initializing next term

for i in 0..<n { //loop will run n times
    print(first) //printing first term
    let temp = next //storing next term in temporary variable
    next = next + second //updating next term
    second = temp //updating second term
    first = temp //updating first term with previous next term
}
