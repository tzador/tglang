// This is a program that calculates the average of a set of numbers
// First, we declare an array of numbers
let numbers = [2, 7, 13, 21, 9, 5, 17]
// Then we declare a variable to hold the sum of the numbers
var sum = 0
// Using a for-in loop, we iterate through the array and add each number to the sum
for number in numbers {
    sum += number
}
// Next, we calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total number of elements in the array
let average = sum / numbers.count
// Finally, we print out the average
print("The average of the numbers is \(average)")
