# This is a Makefile, a file used for automating the build process of a software project.
# It is written in the Make programming language, which is used for managing dependencies between files.
# This Makefile contains a target called "build" that will compile all source files and create an executable called "program".
# It also contains a target called "clean" that will remove all build artifacts.

# Define variables
CC := gcc  # Compiler used for the build process
CFLAGS := -Wall -g  # Flags to be passed to the compiler
SRCS := main.c helper_functions.c  # List of source files
OBJS := $(SRCS:.c=.o)  # List of object files

# Define phony targets
.PHONY: all clean

# Default target to be executed when "make" is called without specifying a target
