# This is a Makefile to compile and execute a simple C++ program
# It sets up variables and rules for compiling and linking the program
# Target: all will compile and link the program
# Target: clean will remove any object or executable files
#
# Variables
CC = g++ # compiler to use
CFLAGS = -Wall -std=c++11 # flags to pass to compiler
SRC = main.cpp # source file to compile
OBJ = main.o # object file to link
EXEC = program.exe # executable to create
#
# Targets and Rules
all: $(EXEC) # target to compile and link program
$(EXEC): $(OBJ) # rule to link object file to create executable
	$(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(EXEC) # command to link files
$(OBJ): $(SRC) # rule to compile source file to object file
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(SRC) # command to compile source file
clean: # target to remove object and executable files
	rm -f $(OBJ) $(EXEC) # command to remove files
