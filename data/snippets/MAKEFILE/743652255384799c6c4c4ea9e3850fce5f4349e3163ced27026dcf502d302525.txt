# This Makefile defines rules for building a C++ program using GCC compiler.

# Declare variables for compiler and flags
CC = g++
CFLAGS = -Wall -c

# Define a rule to build the executable file
# The file main.o should be built before the executable
myprogram: main.o
	$(CC) main.o -o myprogram

# Define a rule to build object files from C++ source files
# The target is dependent on the corresponding source file
main.o: main.cpp
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) main.cpp

# Define a rule to clean up the build directory
# This will delete all object and executable files
clean:
	rm -f *.o myprogram

# Declare the phony target 'all' to build the entire project
.PHONY: all
all: myprogram

# Declare the phony target 'cleanall' to clean the build directory
