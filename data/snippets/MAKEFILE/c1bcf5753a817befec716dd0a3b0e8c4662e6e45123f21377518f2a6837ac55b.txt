# This is a sample makefile snippet for building a C++ project
# It includes different build targets for compiling, linking, and cleaning
# It also uses different variables and flags for customization

# Set the compiler to use
CXX = g++

# Set any additional compiler flags
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11

# Set the project name
PROJECT = my_project

# Set the source files
SOURCES = main.cpp file1.cpp file2.cpp

# Set the object files by replacing .cpp extension with .o
OBJECTS = $(SOURCES:.cpp=.o)

# Declare the build target for compiling the source files into object files
compile: $(SOURCES)
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $^

# Declare the build target for linking the object files into an executable
link: $(OBJECTS)
	$(CXX) -o $(PROJECT) $^

# Declare the build target for cleaning up the object files and executable
clean:
	rm -f $(OBJECTS) $(PROJECT)

# Set phony targets to avoid conflicts with file names
.PHONY: compile link clean
