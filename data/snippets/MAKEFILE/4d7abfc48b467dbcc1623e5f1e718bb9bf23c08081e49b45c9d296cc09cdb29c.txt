### Set variables ###
VAR := value # sets a variable with a value

### Define phony targets ###
.PHONY: clean all # ensures that 'clean' and 'all' are always run, even if there is a file with the same name

### Define targets and specify dependencies ###
all: target1 target2 # specifies that the target 'all' depends on 'target1' and 'target2'

target1: dependency1 dependency2 # specifies that the target 'target1' depends on 'dependency1' and 'dependency2'
	@echo "Running target1"
	# commands to run for target1
	@echo "Target1 completed"

target2: dependency3 dependency4 # specifies that the target 'target2' depends on 'dependency3' and 'dependency4'
	@echo "Running target2"
	# commands to run for target2
	@echo "Target2 completed"

### Define rules ###
dependency1: # specifies that dependency1 has no dependencies
	@echo "Running dependency1"
	# commands to run for dependency1
	@echo "Dependency1 completed"

dependency2: dependency1 # specifies that dependency2 depends on dependency1
	@echo "Running dependency2"
	# commands to run for dependency2
	@echo "Dependency2 completed"

dependency3: # specifies that dependency3 has no dependencies
	@echo "Running dependency3"
	# commands to run for dependency3
	@echo "Dependency3 completed"

dependency4: dependency3 # specifies that dependency4 depends on dependency3
	@echo "Running dependency4"
	# commands to run for dependency4
	@echo "Dependency4 completed"

### Define clean rule ###
clean: # specifies that 'clean' has no dependencies
	@echo "Cleaning up"
	rm -f *.o # removes all files with the .o extension
