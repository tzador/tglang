# This is a comment in a Makefile, using the # symbol

# The first target listed is the default target if no target is explicitly specified
# This target will clean the build directory by deleting all .o files and the executable file
clean:
	rm -rf *.o executable

# This target will compile and link all the source code files to create the executable file
# The compiler used is gcc and the linker used is ld
# The -I flag is used to include a directory containing header files
# The -c flag is used to create an object file
all: main.o functions.o
	gcc -o executable main.o functions.o -I headers

# This target will compile the main source code file and create an object file
# The -g flag is used to include debug symbols for debugging purposes
main.o: main.c
	gcc -c -g main.c

# This target will compile the functions source code file and create an object file
functions.o: functions.c
	gcc -c functions.c

# This target will create a directory named build if it does not already exist
# The @ symbol is used to prevent the command from being printed to the terminal
create-dir:
	@mkdir -p build
