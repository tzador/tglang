# This is a comment in a Makefile
# Targets are commands that can be executed by the make tool

# Declare a variable
VAR = "Hello world"

# Define a target
target:
	@echo $(VAR)

# This target will run the 'target' target before executing its commands
main: target
	@echo "This is the main target"

# This target will delete any generated files and dependencies
clean:
	@rm -rf output/ dependencies/

# This target will create a temporary folder and copy all source files into it
build:
	@mkdir temp/
	@cp src/*.c temp/

# This target will compile the source files in the temporary folder
compile:
	@echo "Compiling source files..."
	@cd temp/ && gcc -c *.c

# This target will link the object files and create an executable
link:
	@mkdir output/
	@echo "Linking object files..."
	@gcc -o output/main.exe temp/*.o

# This target will run the executable
run:
	@echo "Running the program..."
	@./output/main.exe

# This is the default target, it will be executed if no target is specified
# It will first clean, then build, compile, link and finally run the program
all: clean build compile link run
