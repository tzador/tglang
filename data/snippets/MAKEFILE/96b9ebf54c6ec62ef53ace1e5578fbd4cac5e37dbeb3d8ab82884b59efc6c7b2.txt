# This is a comment in a MAKEFILE, denoted by the '#' symbol
# It is used to provide information and context about the code

# 'target' is the first word in a line, followed by a colon ':'
# This indicates the target of the recipe, what we want to create or update
# In this case, we are creating an executable named 'program'

program: main.o  # The required objects for the 'program' target
  gcc main.o -o program  # The recipe to create the 'program' executable
  # 'main.o' is the first required object and '-o' specifies the output filename

main.o: main.c     # The required source files for the 'main.o' target
  gcc -c main.c    # The recipe to create the 'main.o' object file
  # 'gcc' is the compiler, '-c' specifies only compilation (no linking)

clean:            # This is a phony target, not tied to a specific file
  rm *.o program   # The recipe to clean up all object and executable files
  # 'rm' is the command to remove files, '*' is a wildcard for all files

.PHONY: clean   # This declares 'clean' as a phony target, not tied to a file
