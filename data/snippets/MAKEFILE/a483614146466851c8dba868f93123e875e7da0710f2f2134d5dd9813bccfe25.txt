# This is a Makefile, a build automation tool commonly used in software development.
# The following snippet sets up variables and rules to compile and run a C++ program.
# It assumes that a compiler and all necessary libraries are installed on the system.

# Variables
CXX = g++ # sets the C++ compiler to be used for compiling

# Rule to compile the program
program: main.o
	$(CXX) main.o -o program

# Rule to compile the main.cpp source file
main.o: main.cpp
	$(CXX) -c main.cpp

# Rule to clean up object files after compiling
clean:
	rm *.o
