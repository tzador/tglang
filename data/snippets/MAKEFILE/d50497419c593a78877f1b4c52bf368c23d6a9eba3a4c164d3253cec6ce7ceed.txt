# This is a Makefile that defines a set of rules for compiling and linking a C++ program
# Each rule consists of a target, prerequisites, and a recipe
# The target is the name of the output file, the prerequisites are the input files, and the recipe is the set of commands to run
# Variables are defined using the = sign and can be used in the recipes using $(variable_name)
# The target .PHONY is used to specify that a rule does not produce a file, but is just a name for an action

# Define the C++ compiler to use
CXX = g++
# Define the flags for the compiler
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -g

# Specify the target and the prerequisites
# Since there are no prerequisites here, this rule will always run
hello: 
	# Print a message to the console
	@echo "Compiling and linking hello.cpp"
	# Compile the hello.cpp file and create an object file
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c hello.cpp 
	# Link the object file and create the output executable
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) hello.o -o hello 
	# Print a message to the console
	@echo "Finished compiling and linking hello.cpp"

# Specify another target and the prerequisites
# The prerequisites are the source files that must be compiled before executing the rule
calculator: calculator.cpp calculator_functions.cpp
	# Print a message to the console
	@echo "Compiling and linking calculator.cpp and calculator_functions.cpp"
	# Compile both source files and create object files
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c calculator.cpp calculator_functions.cpp 
	# Link the object files and create the output executable
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) calculator.o calculator_functions.o -o calculator 
	# Print a message to the console
	@echo "Finished compiling and linking calculator.cpp and calculator_functions.cpp"

# Specify a third target and the prerequisites
# This rule does not depend on any files, but is just a name for the clean action
.PHONY: clean
# Specify the recipe
clean:
	# Remove the object files and executable
	rm -f *.o hello calculator 
	# Print a message to the console
	@echo "Removed object files and executable"

# Specify a fourth target and the prerequisites
# This rule depends on the other two targets and will run them first
all: hello calculator
	# Print a message to the console
	@echo "Successfully compiled and linked all targets"

# Specify the default target to be executed when no specific target is specified
# In this case, it will run the all target
# This is useful when there are multiple targets and the user does not need to remember their names
.DEFAULT_GOAL := all
