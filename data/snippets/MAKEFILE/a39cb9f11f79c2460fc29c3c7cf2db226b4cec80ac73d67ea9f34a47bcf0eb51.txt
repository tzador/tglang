# This is a makefile used to compile and link multiple source files
# and create an executable

# Compiler options
CC = gcc # indicates the compiler to use
CFLAGS = -g -Wall -Wextra -Werror # flags to pass to the compiler for debugging and error checking
LDLIBS = -lm # libraries to link during the linking phase

# Source files
SRCS = main.c foo.c bar.c # list of source files to be compiled
OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o) # list of object files to be created from source files

# Target executable
TARGET = myprogram # name of the executable to be created

# Make all rule
all: $(TARGET) # rule to make all targets, in this case the executable

# Rule to make executable
$(TARGET): $(OBJS) # specifies the executable target and its dependency on object files
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) -o $@ $(LDLIBS) # command to compile and link object files into the executable
	@echo "Executable '$@' successfully created!" # optional, prints a message upon successful creation of executable

# Rule to make object files
%.o: %.c # specifies the rule to make object files from corresponding source files
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@ # command to compile source file into object file

# Cleanup rule
.PHONY: clean # specifies that the 'clean' rule is not an actual file
clean: # rule to clean up object files and executable
	rm -f $(OBJS) $(TARGET) # command to remove object files and executable
	@echo "All object files and executable removed!" # optional, prints a message upon successful cleanup

# Run rule
.PHONY: run # specifies that the 'run' rule is not an actual file
run: $(TARGET) # rule to run the executable
	./$(TARGET) # command to run the executable

# Help rule
.PHONY: help # specifies that the 'help' rule is not an actual file
help: # rule to display help information
