# A Makefile is a file that contains information about how to compile and build a project.
# It is primarily used for building and managing C/C++ projects, but can be used for other languages and tasks as well.
# This snippet is a sample Makefile for a simple C++ project named "hello_world".
# Define variables for the compilation process.
CXX := g++
# Set compiler flags.
CXXFLAGS := -Wall -g -std=c++11
# Specify the source files needed for the project.
# The wildcard function is used to select all .cpp files in the current directory.
SRC := $(wildcard *.cpp)
# Specify the include directories.
INCLUDE_DIRS := -I /usr/local/include -I ./includes
# Specify the library directories.
LIB_DIRS := -L /usr/local/lib
# Specify the libraries to be linked.
LIBS := -lm
# Specify the output executable name.
EXECUTABLE := hello_world
# Define the default target.
# The first target in a Makefile is the default target that is executed when no target is specified.
# In this case, the default target is set to "all".
all: $(EXECUTABLE)

# Create a rule to build the executable.
# The "@" symbol is used to suppress the default printing of the command that is executed.
# The "-o" flag specifies the output file name.
$(EXECUTABLE): $(SRC)
	@$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(INCLUDE_DIRS) $(LIB_DIRS) $(LIBS) -o $@ $^

# Create a "clean" rule to remove the executable and any object files.
# The ".PHONY" directive tells make that "clean" is not the name of a file, but rather a command.
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	@rm -f $(EXECUTABLE) *.o

# Create a "run" rule to run the executable.
# The "$<" symbol refers to the first dependency (in this case the executable).
.PHONY: run
run: $(EXECUTABLE)
	@./$(EXECUTABLE)

# Create a "debug" rule to compile with additional debugging symbols.
# The "-g" flag is used to include debugging symbols.
.PHONY: debug
debug: CXXFLAGS += -g
debug: $(EXECUTABLE)

# Create a "help" rule to print out a help message.
