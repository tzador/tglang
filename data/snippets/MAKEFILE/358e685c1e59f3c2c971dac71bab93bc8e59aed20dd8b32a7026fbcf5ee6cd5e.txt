## Define variables
SOURCES = main.c helper.c input.c output.c # list of source files
OBJECTS = $(SOURCES:.c=.o) # list of object files created from source files
EXEC = myprogram.out # name of executable file
CC = gcc # compiler to be used

## Compilation rule 
# Creates the executable by linking all object files
$(EXEC): $(OBJECTS)
	$(CC) $^ -o $@

## Object file rules
# Generates the object file for each source file using gcc with appropriate flags
%.o: %.c
	$(CC) -c $< -o $@

## Phony targets
# These targets will not generate any file, they are used to perform specific actions
# "clean" target removes all generated files
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -rf $(OBJECTS) $(EXEC)

# "run" target compiles and runs the program
.PHONY: run
run: $(EXEC)
	./$(EXEC)

# Default target
# When "make" is executed without any target, this target will be executed
.DEFAULT_GOAL := $(EXEC)
