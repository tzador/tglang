# This makefile declares variables for the source and output directories
# and defines two rules for compiling and linking a C program.

# Define the source directory variable
SRCDIR = src
# Define the output directory variable
OUTDIR = bin

# Define the compiler flags variable
CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -g

# Define the source files variable
SOURCES = $(wildcard $(SRCDIR)/*.c)

# Define the object files variable
# by replacing the .c extension with .o for each source file
OBJECTS = $(patsubst $(SRCDIR)/%.c, $(OUTDIR)/%.o, $(SOURCES))

# Define the main target for the makefile
all: main

# Define the main rule for compiling and linking the program
main: $(OBJECTS)
	gcc $(CFLAGS) -o $(OUTDIR)/main $^

# Define a rule for creating object files
# Each object file depends on its corresponding source file
$(OUTDIR)/%.o: $(SRCDIR)/%.c
	gcc $(CFLAGS) -o $@ -c $<

# Define the clean rule for removing all generated files
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	-rm -f $(OUTDIR)/*

# Explain the different elements of the makefile

# Variables:
# - SRCDIR: The source directory for the project
# - OUTDIR: The output directory for compiled files
# - CFLAGS: Compiler flags to be used
# - SOURCES: A list of all source files in the source directory
# - OBJECTS: A list of all object files generated from the source files

# Makefile rules:
# - all: The main target of the makefile. It depends on the main rule and is the first rule to be executed.
# - main: The main rule that compiles and links the program. It depends on all object files.
# - $(OUTDIR)/%.o: A pattern rule for creating object files. It specifies that each object file depends on its corresponding source file in the source directory.
# - clean: A rule for removing all generated files. It is declared as a phony target, meaning it is not actually a file with the same name.

# Command line operations:
# - $(wildcard): A function that finds all files matching a certain pattern and returns them as a list.
# - $(patsubst): A function that replaces a pattern in a list of strings with another pattern.
# - -o: An option flag for gcc that specifies the output file name.
# - -c: An option flag for gcc that specifies to compile source files without linking.
# - -f: An option flag for rm that forces the removal of files without prompting for confirmation.
