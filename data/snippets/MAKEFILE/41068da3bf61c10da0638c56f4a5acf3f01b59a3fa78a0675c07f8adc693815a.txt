# This is a sample MAKEFILE demonstrating complex targets and rules
TARGETS = main program

# Rule for generating the main target
main: dependencies
    gcc -o main main.c

# Rule for generating the program target
program: dependencies
    gcc -o program program.c

# Rule for installing the targets
install: main program
    chmod +x main
    chmod +x program
    mkdir -p /usr/local/bin # create directory if it doesn't exist
    mv main /usr/local/bin
    mv program /usr/local/bin

# Rule for cleaning up generated files
clean:
    rm main program

# Default rule, executes when `make` command is called
all: install

# Rule for checking dependencies, creates them if they don't exist
dependencies:
    touch main.c program.c

# Rule for executing the program
run:
    ./program

# Rule for testing, executes the program with different arguments
test:
    ./program arg1 arg2 arg3
