# This is a makefile with multiple targets and dependencies
# Each dependency has its own recipe to execute when the target is called

# Main target
build: main.o helper.o
	gcc main.o helper.o -o my_program		# recipe to compile main and helper files into an executable called my_program

# Dependencies for main.o
main.o: main.c helper.h
	gcc -c main.c -o main.o			# recipe to compile main.c into an object file

# Dependencies for helper.o
helper.o: helper.c helper.h
	gcc -c helper.c -o helper.o			# recipe to compile helper.c into an object file

# Target to clean the directory of any compiled files
clean:
	rm *.o my_program				# recipe to delete all object files and the executable

# Target to create a backup of the current makefile
backup:
	cp Makefile Makefile.backup			# recipe to copy the makefile and create a backup copy
