target: prerequisites
<tab>recipe1
<tab>recipe2

## Explanation:
# This is a simple makefile target definition.
# The target name is "target" and it has "prerequisites".
# The recipe commands "recipe1" and "recipe2" will be executed 
# if any of the prerequisites are newer than the target.
# The <tab> before the recipe commands is important, as it signifies that 
# the following lines are part of the recipe and not just another target.
