# this is a Makefile
# it is used for automating tasks in software development
# the following snippet creates a target named "run", 
# which compiles and executes a C program

# this sets the default target when "make" is called without a specified target
.DEFAULT_GOAL := run

# the target "run" is dependent on the targets "compile" and "execute"
run: compile execute

# the target "compile" is dependent on the source file "main.c" and the header files "functions.h" and "constants.h"
compile: main.c functions.h constants.h
	gcc -o main main.c

# the target "execute" runs the compiled program named "main"
execute:
	./main

# the target "clean" removes the compiled program and any generated files
clean:
	rm main *.o

# the target "help" displays a message with information about the Makefile and its targets
