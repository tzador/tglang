// The following code snippet creates a smart contract that implements a voting system with different options and allows users to vote and view the results.

    // First, we define the contract with a name and owner address.
    contract VotingSystem {
        string public name; // Name of the contract
        address public owner; // Address of the owner/creator of the contract

        // Next, we define the options for voting as an enum.
        enum Option {OptionA, OptionB, OptionC} // Adding more options is possible by adding more elements to the enum

        // Then, we define a mapping to keep track of the votes for each option.
        mapping (Option => uint) public voteCount; // Maps the option to a vote count

        // We also declare an event which will be triggered when a user casts a vote.
        event Vote(address _voter, Option _votedOption);

        // Next, we create a constructor function to set the name and owner of the contract.
        function VotingSystem(string _name) public {
            name = _name; // Set the contract name
            owner = msg.sender; // Set the owner as the one who deployed the contract
        }

        // Now, we create a function for users to cast their vote.
        function castVote(Option _votedOption) public {
        
            // Make sure the user is not trying to vote for an option that doesn't exist.
            require(_votedOption == Option.OptionA || _votedOption == Option.OptionB || _votedOption == Option.OptionC);

            // Increase the vote count for the chosen option by one.
            voteCount[_votedOption]++;

            // Trigger the event to indicate that a vote has been cast.
            emit Vote(msg.sender, _votedOption);
        }

        // Finally, we create a function to retrieve the total votes for each option.
        function getVotes() public view returns (uint, uint, uint) {
            return (voteCount[Option.OptionA], voteCount[Option.OptionB], voteCount[Option.OptionC]);
        }
    }
