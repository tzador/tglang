//This code snippet is written in Solidity, a programming language used for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

contract MyContract { //Defining a contract called MyContract

    //Variables
    uint public myVariable; //Declaring a public unsigned integer variable called myVariable
    string private myString; //Declaring a private string variable called myString

    //Constructor
    constructor() public { //Defining a constructor function that runs when the contract is deployed
        myVariable = 0; //Setting the initial value of myVariable to 0
        myString = "Hello, World!"; //Setting the initial value of myString to "Hello, World!"
    }

    //Functions
    function setVariable(uint _newVar) public { //Defining a function called setVariable that takes in an unsigned integer parameter called _newVar and can be called by anyone
        myVariable = _newVar; //Updating the value of myVariable to the input parameter value
    }

    function getString() public view returns (string) { //Defining a function called getString that returns a string and can be called by anyone
        return myString; //Returning the current value of myString
    }
