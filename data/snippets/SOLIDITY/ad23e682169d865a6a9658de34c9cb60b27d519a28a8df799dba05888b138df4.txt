/* This code snippet demonstrates how Solidity can be used to create a smart contract that manages a fleet of cars. It includes various functions to add, update, and delete cars, as well as transfer ownership and calculate average mileage. The code also showcases the use of data types, control structures, and modifiers in Solidity. */
