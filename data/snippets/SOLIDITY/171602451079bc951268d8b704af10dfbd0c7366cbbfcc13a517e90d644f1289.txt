// This is a complex and long code snippet in the SOLIDITY programming language.

// Define a contract named "SmartContract"
contract SmartContract {

    // Create an integer variable "counter" and set its initial value to 0
    uint256 counter = 0;

    // Create an empty array of type address named "users"
    address[] users;

    // Create a function named "addUser" that takes in an address "user" as a parameter
    // This function adds the "user" to the "users" array
    function addUser(address user) public {
        users.push(user);
    }

    // Create a function named "getTotalUsers" that returns the length of the "users" array
    // This function can be accessed by anyone (public)
    function getTotalUsers() public view returns (uint256) {
        return users.length;
    }

    // Create a modifier named "onlyOwner"
    // This modifier restricts the use of a function to only the owner of the contract
    // The owner will be defined in the constructor
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }

    // Create a variable "owner" of type address to store the owner of the contract
    address owner;

    // Create a constructor to set the contract owner as the address of the person deploying the contract
    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Create a function named "increaseCounter" that increases the value of "counter" by 1
    // This function can only be called by the contract owner (using the modifier)
    function increaseCounter() public onlyOwner {
        counter++;
    }

    // Create a function named "getCounter" that returns the value of "counter"
    // This function can be accessed by anyone (public)
    function getCounter() public view returns (uint256) {
        return counter;
    }

    // Create an event named "UserAdded" with the address of the user as the parameter
    // This event will be emitted when a user is added using the "addUser" function
    event UserAdded(address user);

    // Create a function named "setCounter" that takes in a new value "value" as a parameter
    // This function can only be called by the contract owner (using the modifier)
    function setCounter(uint256 value) public onlyOwner {
        counter = value;
    }
