//Example contract in Solidity using inheritance and custom data types

//Contract that defines a Person struct
contract Person {
    //Variables for Person's first and last name
    string public firstName;
    string public lastName;

    //Constructor function to set the Person's name
    constructor(string memory _firstName, string memory _lastName) public {

//Contract that inherits Person and defines a Student struct
contract Student is Person {
    //Variable for Student's major

    constructor(string memory _firstName, string memory _lastName, string memory _major) Person(_firstName, _lastName) public {
        major = _major;
    }

//Contract that inherits Person and defines an Instructor struct
contract Instructor is Person {
    //Variable for Instructor's specialty
    string public specialty;

    //Constructor function to set the Instructor's name and specialty
    constructor(string memory _firstName, string memory _lastName, string memory _specialty) Person(_firstName, _lastName) public {
        specialty = _specialty;
    }
}

//Contract that defines a University with array of Students and Instructors
contract University {
    //Array of Student and Instructor structs
    Student[] public students;

    //Function to add a new Student to the students array
