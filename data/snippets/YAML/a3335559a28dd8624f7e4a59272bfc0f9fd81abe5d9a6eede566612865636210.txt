# YAML files use indentation to denote nesting levels
# Lists are denoted by a hyphen (-) at the beginning of the line
# Dictionaries are denoted by key-value pairs using a colon (:) and a space
# Nested lists and dictionaries can be created by indenting further
# Comments can be added using the pound symbol (#) at the beginning of a line
