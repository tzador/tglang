# This is a YAML document

# Here we define a mapping
mapping:
  # This is a scalar key with a string value
  key1: value1
  # This is a scalar key with an integer value
  key2: 2

# This is a sequence of strings
sequence:
  - item1
  - item2
  - item3

# This is a nested mapping
nested_mapping:
  # This is a scalar key with a boolean value
  nested_key: true
  # This is another mapping nested inside the first one
  nested_mapping_2:
    # A scalar key with a float value
    nested_key_2: 1.5
    # A sequence of integers
    nested_sequence: [1, 2, 3]
  # Another scalar key with a string value
  another_nested_key: value2
