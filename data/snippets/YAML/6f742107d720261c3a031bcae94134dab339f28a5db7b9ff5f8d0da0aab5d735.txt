# This is a complex YAML code snippet with multiple levels and data types
# It contains nested dictionaries and lists as well as strings and integers

# Define a top-level dictionary
top_level:
  # Add a key-value pair with a string value
  key1: "This is a string value"
  # Add a key-value pair with an integer value
  key2: 10
  # Add a key-value pair with a list as the value
  key3:
    # Define a list with multiple string values
    - "Value 1"
    - "Value 2"
    # Define a nested dictionary as one of the list elements
    - key4:
        # Add a key-value pair with a boolean value
        key5: true
        # Add a key-value pair with a null value
        key6: null

    # Define another nested dictionary as one of the list elements
    - key7:
        # Add a key-value pair with a float value
        key8: 1.5
        # Add a key-value pair with a list as the value
        key9:
          # Define a list with a mix of string and integer values
          - "Value 3"
          - 100
    
  # Add another key-value pair with a nested dictionary as the value
  key10:
    # Define a nested dictionary
    key11:
      # Add a key-value pair with a string value
      key12: "Another string"

  # Add a final key-value pair with a boolean value
