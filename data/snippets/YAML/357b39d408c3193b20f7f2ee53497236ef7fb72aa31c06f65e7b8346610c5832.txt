# This is a comment in YAML
# Triple dashes act as document separators
# YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language" and is a human-readable data serialization language
---
# Key-value pairs are defined using a colon ":" between the key and value
key: value
number: 123
boolean: true
string: "This is a string"
---
# Lists are denoted by hyphens "- " and can contain any type of data
list:
- string
- 123
- true
- another_list:
   - 456
   - "example"
---
# Multiple documents can be separated by triple dots "---"
key: value
---
other_key: other_value
---
# Complex data structures can be defined using indentation
key:
    - subkey: subvalue
    - subkey2: 
        - subsubkey: subsubvalue
    - subkey3: "This is a nested value"
---
# References can be used using the ampersand "&" and asterisk "*"
key: &reference
    subkey: value
other_key: *reference    # This will refer to the same value as "key"

# Conditional statements can also be used in YAML using the "?" operator
key: value
other_key: 123
condition: value2         # This key will only be defined if "other_key" is equal to 123
? other_key == 123        # Start of conditional statement
key2: value2              # This key will only be defined if the condition is true
:                         # End of conditional statement
---
# YAML also supports anchors and aliases
key1: &anchor "This is a long string"
key2: *anchor             # This key will have the same value as key1

# In conclusion, YAML is a versatile language that allows you to define complex data structures and use conditional statements and references.
