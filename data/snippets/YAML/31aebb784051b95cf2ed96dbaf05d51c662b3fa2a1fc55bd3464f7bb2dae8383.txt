# This is a YAML code snippet that generates a complex nested dictionary

# First, we define a list of fruits
fruits:
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange

# Next, we define a dictionary for each fruit with their properties
apple:
  color: red
  shape: round
  size: medium
banana:
  color: yellow
  shape: curved
  size: large
orange:
  color: orange
  shape: round
  size: small

# Now we create a nested dictionary with fruits as keys and their properties as values
fruit_properties:
  apple: &apple_properties
    color: red
    shape: round
    size: medium
  banana: &banana_properties
    color: yellow
    shape: curved
    size: large
  orange: &orange_properties
    color: orange
    shape: round
    size: small

# We can then access specific fruit properties using their anchor and alias
apple_shape: *apple_properties.shape # Output: round
banana_size: *banana_properties.size # Output: large
orange_color: *orange_properties.color # Output: orange
