# This is a YAML file that demonstrates different data types and structures.

# First, let's define a simple list of fruits.
fruits:
  - apple
  - banana
  - plum

# Next, we can define a dictionary of information about a person.
person:
  name: John Smith
  age: 27
  occupation: Software Engineer

# We can also define an array of dictionaries to represent a list of employees.
employees:
  - name: Sarah Davis
    age: 35
    occupation: Project Manager
  - name: Mike Johnson
    age: 29
    occupation: Designer
  - name: Emily Brown
    age: 32
    occupation: Product Manager

# We can also use YAML anchors and aliases to easily reuse data.
# Let's define an anchor for a list of programming languages.
languages: &languages
  - Python
  - Java
  - JavaScript
  - C++

# We can then use the anchor as an alias to define different lists.
front_end_languages: *languages
back_end_languages:
  - *languages
  - PHP
  - Ruby

# YAML also supports multi-line strings and comments.
multi_line_string: |
  This is a multi-line string
  It can span over multiple lines
  It also preserves newlines.

# We can also use YAML tags to specify data types.
# Here we have a string that will be interpreted as a boolean.
is_hired: !!bool "True"

# Another useful feature of YAML is that it allows for custom tags and data types.
# Let's define a custom color tag and use it in our data.
%COLOR red
favorite_color: !color "red"

# Finally, we can nest data structures within each other.
