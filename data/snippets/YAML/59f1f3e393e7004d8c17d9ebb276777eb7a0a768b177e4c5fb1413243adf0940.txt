# This is a YAML code snippet that creates a map with complex data types as its key-value pairs
map:
    key1: [val1, val2, val3] # key1 has an array as its value
    key2: {val1: "string", val2: true, val3: 123} # key2 has a map as its value
    key3: "A long string that may include spaces and special chars like #,$,%, etc." # key3 has a string as its value
    key4: | # key4 has a multi-line string as its value
        This is a multi-line string in YAML.
        It can contain any number of lines and special characters.
        It is denoted by the "|" symbol and is indented.
    key5: [  # key5 has an array of maps as its value
        {id: 1, name: "John", age: 32},
        {id: 2, name: "Jane", age: 28},
        {id: 3, name: "Bob", age: 45}
    ]
    key6: !Ref # key6 has a tag (denoted by the "!" symbol) that references another value in the YAML
        some_value # this is the value that will be referenced by the tag (defined elsewhere in the YAML)

# The above map can be read and parsed by a YAML parser to retrieve the key-value pairs and their corresponding data types.
