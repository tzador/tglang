# This is a YAML code snippet that uses some advanced features
# such as anchors and flow style:
# First, we define an anchor named 'base' with some key-value pairs:
base: &base
  name: John
  age: 30
  hobbies: [coding, reading, hiking]

# Then, we use the anchor to create two different mappings:
# The first mapping uses flow style:
map1: &map1
  <<: *base
  job: developer
  location: USA
  skills: [python, javascript, css]
  projects:
    - name: Project A
      description: This project requires advanced coding skills
    - name: Project B
      description: This project focuses on front-end development

# The second mapping uses block style:
map2: &map2
  name: Jane
  age: 27
  hobbies:
    - painting
    - traveling
    - cooking
  job: designer
  location: Canada
  <<: *base

# Finally, we use these mappings to create a list of employees:
employees:
  - <<: *map1
  - <<: *map2
