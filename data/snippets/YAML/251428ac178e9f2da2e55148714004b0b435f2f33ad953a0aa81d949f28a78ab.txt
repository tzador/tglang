# This is a complex YAML code snippet that includes multiple levels of nesting and different data types

items: # top level key
  - name: "item1" # first item with key value pair
    quantity: 2 # integer value
  - name: "item2" # second item with key value pair
    quantity: 5 # integer value
    description: |
      This is a multiline description for item2 which includes different
      data types such as strings, integers, and even a boolean value.
      I hope this snippet helps you generate your own YAML code!
    boolean_value: False # boolean value

      - "value1"
      - "value2"
      - "value3"
    nested_dict: # nested dictionary with string and integer values
      nested_item1: 10
      nested_item2: "value"
  - name: "item3" # third item with key value pair
    quantity: 1 # integer value
    nested_dict: # nested dictionary with nested list
      nested_list: # nested list with nested dictionaries
        - name: "nested_item1"
          quantity: 3
