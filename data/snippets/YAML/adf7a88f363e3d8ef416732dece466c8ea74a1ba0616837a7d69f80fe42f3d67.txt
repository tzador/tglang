#Defining a comments

#The code snippet above creates a YAML file with lists and dictionaries, also known as maps. 
#Lists are indicated by the "-" symbol, while dictionaries are defined by using indentation. 
#The fruits list contains three items: apple, banana, and orange. 
#The vegetables list also contains three items: carrot, spinach, and tomato. 
#The people dictionary has three entries, each containing name, age, and occupation information for different individuals. 
#Lastly, the fruit_properties dictionary is a nested dictionary, with each fruit having its own properties such as color, taste, and price.
