# This is a complex YAML code snippet

# First, we define a list of key-value pairs
team_members:
  - name: John # Name of the first team member
    age: 25 # Age of the first team member
    role: Engineer # Role of the first team member

  - name: Sarah # Name of the second team member
    age: 28 # Age of the second team member
    role: Project Manager # Role of the second team member

  - name: Alex # Name of the third team member
    age: 30 # Age of the third team member
    role: Developer # Role of the third team member

# Next, we define a nested structure for projects
projects:
  - name: Project A # Name of the first project
    owner: Sarah # Owner of the first project
    collaborators: # List of collaborators for the first project
      - John
      - Alex

  - name: Project B # Name of the second project
    owner: Alex # Owner of the second project
    collaborators: # List of collaborators for the second project
      - Sarah
      - John

# Finally, we declare a conditional statement
can_work_on_project: Alex and Sarah can work together on Project A 
if (team_members[2].name = "Alex" and team_members[1].name = "Sarah" and projects[0].name = "Project A" and
projects[0].collaborators[0] = "John" and projects[0].collaborators[1] = "Alex")
