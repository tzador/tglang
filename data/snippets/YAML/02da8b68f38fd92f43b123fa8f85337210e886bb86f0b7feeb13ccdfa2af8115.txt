  server:
    port: 3000
    host: localhost
  database:

# We can also use conditional statements in YAML
# Here we check the project version and set a default value if it is not defined
{{ project_version or 1.0 }}

# YAML also supports comments like this one
# We can use them to document our code or provide additional information

# Finally, we can use anchors and aliases in YAML to reference and reuse data
# Here we define an anchor for our project settings and use an alias to reuse it
