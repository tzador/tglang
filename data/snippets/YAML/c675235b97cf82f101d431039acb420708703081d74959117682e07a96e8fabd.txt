    # This is a YAML document
    # An example of a complex code snippet in YAML
    
    # Scalar values
    string: "This is a string value" # A string value, enclosed in double quotes
    integer: 100 # An integer value
    boolean: true # A boolean value (can also be "false" for boolean type)
    null_value: null # A null value
    
    # Sequence (arrays/lists)
    list: # A list value, indented with dashes (-) underneath the parent key
      - "This is the first item" # A string value
      - 200 # An integer value
      - false # A boolean value
      
    # Mapping (key-value pairs)
    map: # A map value, indented with colons (:) underneath the parent key
      key1: "value1" # A key-value pair - key is "key1" and value is "value1"
      key2: 300 # Another key-value pair - key is "key2" and value is 300 (integer)
      key3: # A nested map
        nested_key: "nested_value" # Nested key-value pair
      
    # Comments are preceded by a hash (#) and ignored by the parser
    # You can also use multi-line comments with the | (pipe) character
        
    # Multi-line string (with the | character)
    multiline_string: |
      This is a multi-line string
      It can contain multiple lines
      and preserve line breaks and spacing
    
    # Inline string with escaped characters
    inline_string: "This string contains a \"quote\" character"
    
    # Complex structure with nested arrays and maps

      - key: "value"

          - "item1"
          - "item2"
