# This is a YAML code snippet for a complex configuration file

# First, we define variables using the "variables" keyword
variables:
  vars:
    - var1: "value1"
    - var2: "value2"
    - var3: "value3"

# Next, we define a list of tasks to be performed
tasks:
  - name: "Task 1" # Name of first task
    type: "installation" # Type of task
    tags:
      - "server1" # Tag for server 1
      - "server2" # Tag for server 2
    when: "'var1' in vars" # Condition for task to run
    command: "sh task1.sh" # Command to run for task 1
  - name: "Task 2" # Name of second task
    type: "configuration" # Type of task
    tags:
      - "server2" # Tag for server 2
      - "server3" # Tag for server 3
    when: "'var2' in vars" # Condition for task to run
    command: "sh task2.sh" # Command to run for task 2
  - name: "Task 3" # Name of third task
    type: "cleanup" # Type of task
    tags:
      - "server3" # Tag for server 3
      - "server4" # Tag for server 4
    when: "'var3' in vars" # Condition for task to run
    command: "sh task3.sh" # Command to run for task 3
