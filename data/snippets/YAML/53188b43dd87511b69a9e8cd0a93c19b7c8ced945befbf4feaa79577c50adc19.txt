# YAML Document
---

# Explanation: A basic YAML document starts with three dashes, followed by key-value pairs

# Block Scalar: A multiline block scalar can hold multiple lines of content.
# The 'folded' style of scalar will fold all the lines into a single long line, separated by spaces
# while the 'literal' style will preserve all the line breaks and indentation.

introduction: >
In YAML, you can use the angled greater-than sign (>) to indicate that a scalar
value spans more than one line.

# Flow Mapping: Flow mapping allows for collections to be written in the same line,
# separated by commas. The key and value of each item are separated by a colon.
example_mapping: { key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3 }

# Flow Sequence: Flow sequence allows for collections to be written in the same line,
# separated by commas.
example_sequence: [ value1, value2, value3 ]

# Nested Structures: YAML allows for nested structures, such as mappings or sequences
# nested inside other mappings or sequences.
nested_mapping:
  - key1: value1
    key2: value2
  - key3: value3
    key4: value4
nested_sequence:
  - - value1
    - value2
  - - value3
    - value4
