# This is a long and complex code snippet in YAML

# Define variables

# Define tasks
tasks:
  - name: Task 1                    # Name of the task
    image: ubuntu:latest            # Docker image to use
    script:                         # Script to run
      - echo "Running task 1"
      - echo "Using ${name1}"
      - echo "Using ${name2}"
  - name: Task 2
    image: node:latest
    script:
      - npm install
      - node index.js

# Define stages
stages:
  - name: Stage 1        # Name of first stage
    tasks:               # Tasks to run in this stage
      - Task 1           # Run Task 1 from tasks
      - Task 2           # Run Task 2 from tasks
  - name: Stage 2
    tasks:
      - Task 1
      - Task 2

# Define pipeline
pipeline:
  - jobs:
      - name: Build and Test  # Name of job
        stages:               # Stages to run in this job
          - Stage 1           # Run Stage 1 from stages
          - Stage 2           # Run Stage 2 from stages
