# This is a sample YAML configuration file

# Define the root level node with its corresponding key
root:
    # Description of the key's value
    key: value

    # Use an array for multiple values
    multiple_values:
        - first_value # First item in the array
        - second_value # Second item in the array

    # Define sub-level nodes with corresponding key-value pairs
    sub_node:
        sub_key: sub_value

    # Use indentation to denote relationship between nodes
    # Nested nodes can have multiple levels
    # Values can be of different data types
    nested_node:
        nested_key:
            - string_value # List of strings
            - 1 # Integer value
            - true # Boolean value
            - [1, 2, 3] # Nested list

# Comments can be added using the '#' symbol at the beginning of a line
# Comments can also be added after a key-value pair
# Keys are case-sensitive and should be written in lowercase by convention
# Values can be written with or without quotes, but quotes are recommended for strings
# YAML files can also contain variables, which can be referenced using the '$' symbol
# Variables are defined at the top of the file, with key-value pairs in the format 'variable: value'
# Variables can be used as part of the value for any key, by simply using the variable name within curly braces
# Example:
my_variable: "Hello World"
sub_node:
    sub_key: "This is ${my_variable}"

# YAML files can also contain lists of objects, denoted by a hyphen
# Objects can have nested key-value pairs, similar to JSON
