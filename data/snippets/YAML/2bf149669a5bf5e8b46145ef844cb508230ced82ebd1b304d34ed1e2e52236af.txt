# This YAML file defines variables for Ansible playbooks

---
OK: this is the first declaration of a YAML document.
  some_var: Hello, World! # This is an example of a variable declaration
  another_var:      # This is another variable declaration
      - This is the first element of a list
      - This is the second element of a list

  a_map: # This is a map
      element_1: This is the first key/value pair
      element_2: This is the second key/value pair

# This section is used for defining tasks in Ansible playbooks
tasks:
  - name: This task prints all the declared variables
    debug: # This task prints the value of a variable using the 'debug' module
      msg: "The first variable is {{ some_var }}"
      verbosity: 2

  - name: This task iterates over a list and prints each element
    debug: # This task uses a loop to iterate over the list and prints each element using the 'debug' module
      msg: "The element at index {{ loop.index }} is {{ item }}"
    loop: "{{ another_var }}" # This is the loop declaration

  - name: This task prints each key/value pair in the map
    debug: # This task uses a loop to iterate over the map and prints each key/value pair using the 'debug' module
      msg: "The value of {{ key }} is {{ value }}"
    loop: "{{ a_map | dict2items }}" # This is the loop declaration, using the 'dict2items' filter to convert the map to a list of key/value pairs
    loop_control:
      loop_var: item
      loop_var: key # This is the variable used to store the key in each iteration
      loop_var: value # This is the variable used to store the value in each iteration
