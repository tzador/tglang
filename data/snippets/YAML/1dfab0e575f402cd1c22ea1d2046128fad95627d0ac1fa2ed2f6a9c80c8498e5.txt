# This is a complex YAML code snippet
# It contains a list, dictionary, and conditional statements

# Define a list of fruits
fruits:
    - apple
    - banana
    - orange
    - strawberry

# Define a dictionary of prices for each fruit
prices:
    apple: 1.50
    banana: 2.00
    orange: 1.75
    strawberry: 3.00

# Define a conditional that checks if the fruit is in the list
- if 'apple' in fruits:
    # Print a message with the fruit name and its price
    - "The price of an apple is $ {{ prices['apple'] }}"
- else:
    # Print a message indicating the fruit is not in the list
    - "Sorry, that fruit is not available"
