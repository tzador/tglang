  Welcome to our tutorial on YAML front matter!
  
  Front matter is a section at the beginning of a document, typically used to set metadata such as the title, author, date, and categories or tags for blog posts, articles, or documents.
  
  In YAML, front matter is enclosed in triple dashes and must appear at the very beginning of the document. It is usually followed by empty lines before the actual content starts.
  
  Let's break down the front matter in this example:
  
  - The title of our post is "A Guide to YAML Front Matter"
  - The layout is "post", indicating that this is a blog post
  - The date is set to May 20, 2020
  - The categories are "programming" and "YAML"
  - The tags are "tutorial" and "front matter"
  - The author is John Doe
  
  Now, let's see an example of how we would use this front matter in a Markdown document:
  
  # {{ page.title }}
  
  Written by {{ page.author }}
  
  Posted on {{ page.date }}
  
  Categories: {{ page.categories | join: ', ' }}
  
  Tags: {{ page.tags | join: ', ' }}

  {{ page.content }}

  You can also include code snippets in different programming languages using triple backticks followed by the language code, for example:
