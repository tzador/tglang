# This is a YAML code snippet.

# YAML is a human-readable data serialization language commonly used in configuration files.

# The following code snippet creates a list of tasks and their respective details using the YAML syntax.

# Tasks List:
tasks:
  - task: 'Do homework' # start of first task
    details: 
      subject: Math
      deadline: 2020-09-30
      completed: false
  - task: 'Study for exam' # start of second task
    details:
      subject: Science
      deadline: 2020-10-10
      completed: false
  - task: 'Write report' # start of third task
    details:
      subject: History
      deadline: 2020-10-15
      completed: true # end of third task

# Each task is represented by a hyphen (-) followed by the task name and details enclosed in curly braces ({}).

# The "task" and "details" keywords are followed by a colon (:) to indicate the start of their respective values.

# The task name and details are also indented with two spaces to indicate hierarchy.

# Comments can also be added using the pound symbol (#).

# This code snippet can be used as a template for creating a more extensive task list in a YAML file.
