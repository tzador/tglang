# This is a YAML file, used for configuration and data representation.

# This line indicates the beginning of a document, must always be used as the first line.
# Three dashes are used to separate the beginning and end of a document.

# This is a comment, can be used as descriptions or notes for different sections of the document.

# A YAML document consists of key-value pairs organized into a nested structure.

# YAML supports different data types such as strings, integers, floats, booleans, lists, and maps.

# Here is an example of a YAML document with different data types:

# Each line consists of a key, followed by a colon and a space, then the value associated with the key.

# Scalars:
name: John
age: 25
height: 5.11
is_employee: true

# Sequences:
languages:
  - Python
  - Java
  - C++
hobbies:
  - hiking
  - photography
  - cooking

# Nested maps:
personal_info:
  first_name: John
  last_name: Smith
  contact_info:
    email: johnsmith@example.com
    phone: 123-456-7890
  address_info:
    street: 123 Main Street

    zip_code: 12345

# Arrays of maps:
users:
  - name: John
    age: 25
  - name: Sarah
    age: 30

# YAML documents can also use anchors and aliases for reusable data:
sales_info: &sale
  product: laptop
  price: $1000
  sold: true

# Aliases can be used to reference the anchor:
promotion_info:
  sale: *sale
  discount: 10%

# YAML documents can also include complex structures such as flow mappings and flow sequences:
flow_mappings: {key1: value1, key2: value2}
flow_sequences: [value1, value2, value3]

# A YAML document with multiple documents can use the document separator "---" to separate them:
