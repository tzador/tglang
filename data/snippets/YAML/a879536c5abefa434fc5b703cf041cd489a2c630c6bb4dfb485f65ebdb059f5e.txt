# YAML document
# This is a sample document to demonstrate the use of YAML as a data serialization language

# Comments in YAML start with the hash symbol '#'

# Basic structure of YAML
# YAML documents are made up of key-value pairs (also called mappings), lists, and scalars (single values)

# Key-value pairs are defined using the colon ':'
# The key and the corresponding values are separated by a colon and a space
# Keys can't have spaces but values can have spaces in double quotes

# Lists are used to group similar values together
# Lists start with a hyphen '-'
# Each value in the list is preceded by a hyphen and a space

# Scalars are single values and can be integers, floats, strings, boolean, etc.

# Example YAML document with key-value pairs, lists and scalars

# This is a key-value pair representing a name and its corresponding value
name: John Smith

# This is another key-value pair representing an age and its corresponding value
age: 30

# The following is a list of hobbies. Each hobby is a value in the list
hobbies:
  - Reading
  - Writing
  - Coding

# This is a boolean value represented by 'true' or 'false'
is_employed: true

# This is a key-value pair where the value is a string containing spaces and special characters
address: "123 Main Street, Apt #5"

# Nested key-value pairs
# A key-value pair can also contain another key-value pair, forming a nested structure
personal_details:
  name: Jane Doe
  age: 25
  hobbies:
    - Painting
    - Traveling
  is_employed: false

# Lists can also contain nested structures like key-value pairs
# The following list contains two key-value pairs as its elements
