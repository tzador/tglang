# This is a complex and long code snippet in YAML language

# This YAML file is used for configuring a website's navigation menu

# First, we define the menu items and their corresponding links
menu_items:
  - Home: /home
  - About: /about
  - Products:
    - Laptops: /products/laptops
    - Phones: /products/phones

# Next, we define the menu structure, with Home being the main item
# and Products being a dropdown menu
menu_structure:
  - Home
  - Products:

# Now, we define the layout and style of the menu
menu_layout:
  # The type of menu we want, in this case a horizontal menu
  type: horizontal

  # The background color of the menu
  background_color: #fff

  # The font color of the menu items
  font_color: #000

  # The font size of the menu items
  font_size: 14px

  # The spacing between menu items and the edges of the menu
  padding: 15px 20px

# Lastly, we define any additional options for the menu
menu_options:
  # Whether to show the menu on every page or just the homepage
  show_on_all_pages: true

  # Whether to include a search bar on the menu
  include_search: false

  # Whether to make the menu sticky on scroll
  sticky_menu: true

# And that's it, our fully configured navigation menu in YAML format!
