# This is a YAML code snippet
# It defines a list of fruits and their colors

# YAML uses indentation to define hierarchies
# In this example, the list is the top level hierarchy
list:
    # Each item in the list is defined with a dash followed by a space
    - name: apple
      color: red
    - name: banana
      color: yellow
    - name: strawberry
      color: red
    - name: lemon
      color: yellow
    - name: blueberry
      color: blue
    - name: orange
      color: orange

# YAML also supports nested lists
# In this example, the list of red fruits is nested within the top level list
    - name: red fruits
      # Nested lists are defined with indentation
      list:
          # Again, each item is defined with a dash followed by a space
          - name: apple
            color: red
          - name: strawberry
            color: red

# YAML allows for multiple lines for a single value using the pipe symbol (|)
# In this example, the description for the list of fruits is written in multiple lines, as indicated by the pipe symbol (|)
