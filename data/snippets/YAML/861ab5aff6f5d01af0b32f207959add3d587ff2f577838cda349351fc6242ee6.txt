# An example for a YAML code snippet with annotations

# Comments in YAML start with a "#" and can be used for explanations or documenting the code.

# YAML files use indentation to denote hierarchy. Each level is indented by two spaces.
# YAML does not use curly braces or semicolons, so indentation is crucial for the code to run correctly.

# The colon ":" symbol is used to separate keys and values in YAML.

# A YAML document starts with three dashes "---" on a new line.

# A key-value pair in YAML is denoted by the key on the left followed by a colon and a space, then the value on the next line.
# In this example, the key is "name" and the value is "John".
# The value can also be a string, boolean, integer, list, or another key-value pair.
name: John

# A list is denoted by using a dash "-" followed by a space before each item.
