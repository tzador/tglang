# This is a complex YAML code snippet that demonstrates various properties and data types.
# It includes key-value pairs, lists, nested structures, comments, and more.

# Start with defining global properties
global:
    environment: production
    log_level: info
    database_url: "localhost:5432"

# Define a list of server nodes
servers:
  - name: server1
    ip_address: 192.168.1.1
    port: 8080
  - name: server2
    ip_address: 192.168.1.2
    port: 8081
  - name: server3
    ip_address: 192.168.1.3
    port: 8082

# Define a nested structure to hold user information
users:
  - name: John
    age: 30
    address:
        street: 123 Main St.
        city: New York
        country: USA
  - name: Jane
    age: 28
    address:
        street: 456 Maple St.

    age: 35,
    address:
        street: 789 Oak St.
        city: Chicago
        country: USA

# Set up a conditional for different environments
dev:
  # Use a different database for development
  database_url: "localhost:5433"
testing:
  # Use a different log level for testing
  log_level: debug

# Add comments for clarity
# This is the end of the YAML code snippet.
