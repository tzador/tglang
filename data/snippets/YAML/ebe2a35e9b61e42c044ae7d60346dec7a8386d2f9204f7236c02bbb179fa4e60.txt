# This is a YAML document that uses a simple configuration format with key-value pairs, lists, and nested structures

# The top-level key-value pairs are used to define basic settings for the document
# Here we are setting the document version, author, and description
version: "1.0"
author: "John Doe"
description: "Example YAML document"

# The settings key is used to define a list of settings with key-value pairs
