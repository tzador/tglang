# with various data types and nesting.
# It includes lists, dictionaries, strings, integers, and booleans.

# A dictionary with a nested list as a value
some_dict:
  key1: [1, 2, 3]
  key2: [4, 5, 6]

# A list of dictionaries with different data types as values
some_list:
  - key1: 'yes'
    key2: 15
    key3: True
  - key1: 'no'
    key2: 7
    key3: False

# A string with special characters
some_string: 'Hello!@#$%^&*()'

# An integer value
some_int: 10

# A boolean value
some_bool: True

# A nested dictionary with lists and a nested dictionary
