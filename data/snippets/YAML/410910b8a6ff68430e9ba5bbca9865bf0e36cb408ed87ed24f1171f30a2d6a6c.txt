#An example of a complex YAML configuration file

#Comments start with a pound sign and are ignored by the parser

#The top level is made up of key-value pairs, each separated by a colon
#Keys should be unique and enclosed in quotes if they have special characters
#Values can be strings, numbers, booleans, lists, or another key-value pair

#An example of a string value
name: "John Smith"

#An example of a number value
age: 28

#An example of a boolean value
is_employee: true

#An example of a list value
hobbies:
  - playing guitar
  - hiking
  - reading

#An example of a nested key-value pair
address:
  street: "123 Main Street"
  city: New York
  state: NY

#Lists and nested key-value pairs can be mixed and matched to create complex structures
#YAML also supports the use of anchors and aliases to reduce code repetition

#An example of anchors and aliases
- &name "John Smith"
