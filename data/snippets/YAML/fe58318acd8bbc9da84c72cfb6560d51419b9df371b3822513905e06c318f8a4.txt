# A complex YAML code snippet with multiple levels of nesting and arrays
# Define a map with key-value pairs
map:
  key1: value1
  key2: 2  # This key has a number as value
  key3: true  # This key has a boolean as value
  key4:
    nestedKey1: string1  # This key has a string as value
    nestedKey2: 3.14  # This key has a float as value
    nestedKey3:     # This key is an empty array
    nestedKey4:      # This key is an empty object
  key5: [1, 2, 3]  # This key has an array as value
  key6:            # This key is a list of objects
    - name: John   # First object with key-value pairs
      age: 25
    - name: Mary   # Second object with key-value pairs
      age: 30
    - name: Bob    # Third object with key-value pairs
      age: 40
      hobbies:     # This key is a nested object within the list
