# This is a YAML file
# It contains complex mapping, sequences, and nested structures
# to showcase the flexibility and power of YAML

# Define a root document
root:
  # Nested mapping with additional level
  nested:
    # Sequence of strings
    - item one
    - item two
    # Sequence of integers
    - 1
    - 2
  # Mapping with nested sequences
  mapping with nested sequences:
    # Nested sequence
    - item 1:
      # Sub-mapping
      key: value
    - item 2:
      # Nested sequence
      - nested item one
      - nested item two
      - nested item three
    - item 3:
      # Sub-mapping
      key one: 1
      key two: 2
      key three: 3
# Sequence with nested mappings
sequence with nested mappings:
  # First item
  - key: value
    # Second item
  - key one: 1
    key two: 2
    key three: 3
  # Third item
  - nested:
      - item one
      - item two
      - item three
  - mapping:
      key: value
      nested key:
        - nested item 1
        - nested item 2
        - nested item 3
