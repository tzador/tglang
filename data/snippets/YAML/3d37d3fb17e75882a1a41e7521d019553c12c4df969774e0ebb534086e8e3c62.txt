# This YAML code snippet demonstrates the use of nested lists and key-value pairs
# to create a structured and organized data set. It can be used to store and access
# information about different animals, such as their name, type, diet, habitat, and
# predators. By using YAML, we can easily define and manipulate complex data structures
# without the need for a complicated code.
