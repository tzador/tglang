# This is a complex YAML code snippet designed to test your knowledge of the language.

# Let's start with a simple list, denoted by a hyphen and a space:
- apples
- bananas
- oranges

# Now, let's add some complexity by creating a nested list:
- fruits:
  - apples
  - bananas
  - oranges
- vegetables:
  - carrots
  - lettuce
  - tomatoes

# We can also add key-value pairs using the colon and space notation:
name: John
age: 25
favorite_fruit: apples

# And finally, we can create a more complex structure by incorporating mappings and sequences:
person:
  name: John
  age: 25
  favorite_fruits:
    - apples
    - bananas
    - oranges
  favorite_vegetables:
    - carrots
    - lettuce
    - tomatoes
