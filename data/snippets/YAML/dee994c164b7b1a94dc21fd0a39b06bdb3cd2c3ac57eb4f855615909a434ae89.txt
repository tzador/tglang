# This is an example of a YAML code snippet.

# YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language" and is a human-readable data serialization language.
# It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data needs to be transferred between different programming languages.

# In this example, we have a list of fruits with their colors and prices.

fruits:
  # The "-" symbol indicates the start of a new item in the list.
  - type: apple
    color: red
    price: 1.00
  - type: banana
    color: yellow
    price: 0.50
  - type: orange
    color: orange
    price: 0.75

# We can also include comments within the code using the "#" symbol.
# This can be useful for describing the purpose of each item or for providing additional information.

# We can also create nested structures by using indentation.
# In the example below, we have a list of different types of apples, each with their own color and price.
apples:
  - type: red delicious
    color: red
    price: 1.50
  - type: granny smith
    color: green
    price: 1.25
  - type: fuji
    color: pink
    price: 1.75
