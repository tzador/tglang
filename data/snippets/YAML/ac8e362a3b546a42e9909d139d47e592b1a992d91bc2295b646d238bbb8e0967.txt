# This is a complex YAML code snippet that demonstrates the use of anchors and aliases
# An 'anchor' is defined using an '&' followed by a name, which can be referenced later
# An 'alias' is defined using an '*' followed by the name of the anchor it points to

- &person
  # This is an anchor named 'person'
  name: John
  age: 30
  job: Engineer
  
# This is a list of aliases pointing to the 'person' anchor
- *person
- *person

- &car
  # This is an anchor named 'car'
  make: Toyota
  model: Camry
  year: 2022
  owner: *person.name   # Here, we use an alias to refer to the 'name' property of the 'person' anchor

- &family
  # This is an anchor named 'family'
  members:
    - *person  # Here, we use an alias to refer to the 'person' anchor
    - name: Kate
      age: 28
      job: Doctor  # Instead of using an alias, we can also define a new value for the 'job' property

# This is a list of aliases pointing to the 'family' anchor
- *family
- *family

# In this case, 'person' and 'car' have multiple references using aliases, while 'family' has nested anchors and aliases
