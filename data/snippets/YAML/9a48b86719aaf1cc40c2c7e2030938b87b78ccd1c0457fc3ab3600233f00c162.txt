# This is a YAML file
# It is used for storing and transmitting data in a readable manner
# YAML supports all kinds of data types, including strings, integers, arrays, and more

# Here is an example of a simple YAML data structure
# It contains a string, an integer, and an array
# This data could be used for configuring a website or application

# The key-value pairs are denoted by a colon ':' and are indented with two spaces
# Arrays are denoted by a hyphen '-' and are indented with four spaces
# The order of elements in an array is preserved

# Let's create a simple website configuration using YAML
