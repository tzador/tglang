# This is a YAML code snippet that contains complex data structures and configurations

# First, we define some variables
variables:
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
    key3: value3

# Next, we create a list of users with nested properties
users:
    - name: John
      age: 25
      hobbies:
        - coding
        - reading
    - name: Mary
      age: 30
      hobbies:

        - hiking
    - name: Bob
      age: 20
      hobbies:
        - swimming
        - painting

# We also include some conditional statements
if: 
  condition: ${{ eq(variables.key1, "value1") }}
  then: 
    - name: Adam
      age: 35
      hobbies:
        - cooking
        - yoga
  else: 
    - name: Sarah
      age: 40
      hobbies:
        - photography
        - dancing

# Lastly, we define a nested dictionary for environment variables
env:
    development:
        key: value
        nested:
            key1: value1
            key2: value2
    production:
        key: value
        nested:
            key1: value1
            key2: value2
