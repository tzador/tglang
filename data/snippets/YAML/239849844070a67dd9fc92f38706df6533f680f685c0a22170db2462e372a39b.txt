# Define a literal block scalar
literal: |
  This is a long
  block of text
  spanning multiple lines
  without any special characters
  
# Define a folded block scalar
folded: >
  This is a long block of text
  spanning multiple lines but
  will be folded into a single line
  and all line breaks will be replaced with spaces.
