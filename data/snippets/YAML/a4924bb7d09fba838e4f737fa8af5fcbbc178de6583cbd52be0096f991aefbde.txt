# This is a complex YAML code snippet 
# It includes lists, objects, mappings, and special characters

# A list with items of different data types
list:
  - 1
  - "two"
  - boolean: true
  - object:
      property: "value"
      nestedObject:
        array:
          - "item 1"
          - "item 2"
  - "special character: \""

# An object with properties that have special characters
object:
  property: "This is a string with \" and \n special characters"
  another_prop: 'This is a string with single quotes \' and special characters'

# A mapping with keys and values of different data types
mapping:
  key1: "value 1"
  key2: 2
  key3: true
  key4:
    - "item 1"
    - "item 2"
# Two mappings can be merged using <<

# An array of strings and a block style string
array_of_strings:
  - "string1"
  - "string2"
  - |- 
    This is a  multiline 
    block style string 
    that allows for special characters like \\ and \"
    And preserves line breaks and indentation.
