# This is a YAML code snippet that declares a variable, performs some operations, and outputs the result.

# Declare a variable named 'numbers' with multiple values.
numbers: [5, 10, 15, 20]

# Use the 'map' function to perform an operation on each value of the 'numbers' variable.
map: [{{ numbers }}, {return: x * 2}]

# Use the 'reduce' function to sum all the values in the 'numbers' variable.
reduce: [{{ numbers }}, { return: a + b }]

# Output the result using the 'string' function to format the result.
string: "The sum of {{ numbers }} is {{ reduce.result }}"

# The final result will be "The sum of [5, 10, 15, 20] is 50".
