# Explanation:
# The code snippet above creates a list of songs with their corresponding metadata, such as title, artist, genre, year, and duration (in seconds).
# Each song is represented as a dictionary and is preceded by a hyphen (-) to indicate it is an item in the list.
# The use of indentation (two spaces) is important in YAML to indicate the hierarchy of the data.
# Comments can be added in YAML using the pound sign (#).
# The colon (:) is used to indicate key-value pairs in a dictionary.
# This snippet can be used to easily store and access information about songs in a structured manner.
