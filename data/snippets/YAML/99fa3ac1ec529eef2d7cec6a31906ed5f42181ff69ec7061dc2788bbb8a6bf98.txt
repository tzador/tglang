# This is a YAML code snippet
# It contains multiple data types and structures
# Use it as a reference or for testing purposes

# YAML starts with a series of key-value pairs, with a colon separating them
# Keys must be unique and cannot contain any special characters

key: value
another_key: "another value"

# YAML supports different data types for values, such as string, integer, and boolean

string_value: "This is a string"
integer_value: 12345
boolean_value: true

# YAML also supports lists, which are denoted by a hyphen followed by a space

list_value:
  - "Item 1"
  - "Item 2"
  - "Item 3"

# Lists can also contain nested lists or key-value pairs

nested_list:
  - "Nested Item 1"
  - another_nested_list:
    - "Nested Item 2"
    - "Nested Item 3"
  - another_key: "Nested Item 4"

# YAML also supports maps, which are similar to dictionaries in other languages
# Maps use colon and indentation to denote key-value pairs

map_value:
  key1: "Value 1"
  key2: "Value 2"

# Maps can also contain nested maps and lists

nested_map:
  key1: "Nested Map Value 1"
  key2:
    - "Nested List Item 1"
    - "Nested List Item 2"
  key3:
    nested_key1: "Nested Map Value 2"
    nested_key2: "Nested Map Value 3"
