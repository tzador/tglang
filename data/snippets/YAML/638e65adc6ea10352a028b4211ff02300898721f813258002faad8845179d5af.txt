# This is a complex code snippet written in YAML, which is a markup language used for configuration files.

# The following section defines a map with key-value pairs, where the values are strings, integers, and a boolean.
map:
  string: "This is a string value"
  integer: 42
  boolean: true

# The next section defines a list with different data types, such as strings, integers, booleans, and a map.
list:
  - "This is a string in a list"
  - 123
  - true
  - 
    another_map: 
      float: 3.14
      null_value: null

# This code also includes nested maps within the list, a common feature in YAML.
# The map below contains a nested map with a string as its value.
nested_map:
  key: 
    nested_key: "This is a nested string"

# Lastly, this code snippet includes a YAML document separator "---"
# which indicates the end of one document and the start of a new one.
# This is useful when working with multiple YAML documents in one file.
