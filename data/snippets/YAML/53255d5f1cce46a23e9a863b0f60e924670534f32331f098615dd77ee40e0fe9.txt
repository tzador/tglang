# This is a YAML code snippet that demonstrates the use of arrays and objects

# Define an array with strings
names:
  - John
  - Mary
  - Michael

# Define an object with key-value pairs
user:
  name: John
  age: 30
  hobbies:
    - reading
    - coding
    - hiking

# Use YAML anchor to create reference for an object
# Reference will be used later for duplicate object
anchors:
  - &user1
    name: John
    age: 30
    hobbies:

# Use YAML alias to duplicate an object using the reference
user2: *user1  # user2 will have the same key-value pairs as user1, but is a separate object

# Define an object with nested objects
employee:
  name: Mary
  position: Manager
  department:
    name: Finance
    location: NYC
    employees:
      - &user2  # use alias to reference the user2 object within the employees array

# Use YAML merge key to merge the key-value pairs from another object
admin:
  <<: *user1  # admin will now have the same key-value pairs as user1, in addition to its own name, age, and hobbies

# Define an array of objects using shorthand syntax
customers: [{name: Michael, age: 25}, {name: Sarah, age: 35}]

# Define an object with complex keys
