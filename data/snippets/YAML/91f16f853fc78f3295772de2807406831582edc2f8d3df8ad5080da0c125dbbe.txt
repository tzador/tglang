# This is a long and complex YAML file
# It sets up a list of users with their information

# First we define the keys and data type for each user
users:
    # The user's ID, which is a unique integer
    - key: id
      type: integer
    # The user's name, which is a string
    - key: name
      type: string
    # The user's age, which is an integer
    - key: age
      type: integer
    # The user's email address, which is a string (not required)
    - key: email
      type: string
      required: false

# Now we add some actual users to the list
# Each user is represented as a map
- id: 1 # This user's ID is 1
  name: John Doe # The user's name is John Doe
  age: 28 # John Doe is 28 years old
  email: john.doe@example.com # John Doe's email address
- id: 2 # This user's ID is 2
  name: Jane Smith # The user's name is Jane Smith
  age: 32 # Jane Smith is 32 years old
  email: jane.smith@example.com # Jane Smith's email address
- id: 3 # This user's ID is 3
  name: Bob Johnson # The user's name is Bob Johnson
  age: 45 # Bob Johnson is 45 years old
# Bob Johnson does not have an email address listed
