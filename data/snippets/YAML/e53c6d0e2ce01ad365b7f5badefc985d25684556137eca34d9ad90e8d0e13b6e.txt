# This is a sample YAML code snippet
yaml:
  # This is a nested property
  nested_property:
    # This is a list
    - item1
    - item2
    # This is a dictionary
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
    # This is a nested dictionary
    nested_dictionary:
      nested_key1: nested_value1
      nested_key2: nested_value2
# This is another property
another_property: another_value
# This is a property with a multiline value using the '|' indicator
multiline_property: |
  This is a long
  multiline value
# This is a property with a nested multiline value
nested_multiline_property:
  # This is a nested property
  nested_property:
    # This is a multiline value using the '>' indicator
    multiline_value: >
      This is a very long multiline
      value that will be folded by YAML
      to fit within a single line in the output
