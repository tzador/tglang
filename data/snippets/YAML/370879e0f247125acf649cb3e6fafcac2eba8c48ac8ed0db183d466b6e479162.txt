# This is a complex code snippet in YAML
# It contains nested lists, dictionaries, and variables

# Define a list of fruits

# Use a variable for number of items
Number of Items: 3

# Loop through list of fruits and print each item
- for fruit in Fruits:
    # Format string with variable
    - `There are ${Number of Items} fruits: ${fruit}`

# Loop through dictionary of vegetables
- for vegetable in Vegetables:
    # Print the key and value
    - `This vegetable is: ${key} - ${value}`:

    # Check for nested dictionary
    - if value is dictionary:
        # Loop through nested dictionary
        - for type in value.Variety:
            # Format string with nested variable
            - `Variety: ${type} from ${value.Origin}`
    # Check for nested list
    - elif value is list:
        # Loop through nested list
        - for type in value:
            # Format string with nested variable
            - `Variety: ${type}`
