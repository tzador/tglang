# Example of a complex YAML code snippet 

# Comments start with the '#' character 
# Here, we define a top-level key called 'variables' and assign a variable value of 'true'
variables: true

# We also define a top-level key called 'tasks' to configure a list of tasks 
# Each task has a unique name and corresponding configuration options 
tasks:
  - name: 'task1'
    action: 'run'
    command: 'python script.py'
    args:
      - arg1: value1
      - arg2: value2
    environment:
      ENV_VAR: 'test'
      PATH: '$PATH:/usr/bin:/bin'
      
  - name: 'task2'
    action: 'run'
    command: 'npm install'
    args:
      - arg1: value1
      - arg2: value2
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: 'dev'
      PATH: '$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin'

# We can also define nested keys, such as 'config' under 'tasks' 
# And add custom values for each task 
tasks:
  - name: 'task3'
    action: 'run'
    command: 'bash script.sh'
    args:
      - arg1: value1
      - arg2: value2
    config:
      type: 'bash'
      scripts:
        - script1.sh
        - script2.sh
