# This is a sample YAML code snippet with YAML object and array
# We start by defining an object with three key-value pairs
# The first key is a string, the second key is an integer, and the third key is a boolean
object:
  string_key: "This is a string"
  integer_key: 250
  boolean_key: true

# Next, we define an array with three elements
array:
  - "First Element"
  - 14
  - false

# We can also nest objects and arrays within objects and arrays
nested_object:
  nested_array:
    - "Nested element"
    - 37
    - true
  nested_object:
    nested_key: "Nested value"
    another_nested_key: 52

# YAML allows for referencing values from other keys using the "&" symbol
referencing_keys:
  first_key: &first_value "This is a referenced value"
  second_key: *first_value # This will output "This is a referenced value"

# We can also create aliases for values using the "*" symbol
aliases:
  key: &value "This is an aliased value"
  alias_one: *value # This will output "This is an aliased value"
  alias_two: *value # This will also output "This is an aliased value"
