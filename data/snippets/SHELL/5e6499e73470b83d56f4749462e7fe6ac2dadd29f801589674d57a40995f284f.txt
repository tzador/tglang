# This is a complex code snippet that demonstrates the use of functions and command line arguments in a Bash script

# Define a function that checks if a number is even or odd
is_even_odd() {
    num=$1
    if (( num % 2 == 0 ))
    then
        echo "$num is even"
    else
        echo "$num is odd"
    fi
}

# Check if a command line argument is provided and assign it to a variable
if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then
    echo "Please provide a number as a command line argument"
else
    input_num=$1

    # Check if the input number is a positive integer
    if [[ $input_num =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]
    then
        # Call the function to determine if it is even or odd
        is_even_odd $input_num
    else
        echo "Please provide a positive integer as a command line argument"
    fi
fi

# Output:
# 10 is even (if 10 is provided as a command line argument)
# 9 is odd (if 9 is provided as a command line argument)
# Please provide a number as a command line argument (if no argument is provided)
# Please provide a positive integer as a command line argument (if a non-integer is provided as an argument)
