#!/bin/bash
# This is a Bash script that performs a few different tasks
# First, it initializes a variable called "name" and assigns it the value "John"
name="John"

# Next, it uses the "echo" command to print a message to the user
echo "Hello, $name! Welcome to my Bash script."

# Then it uses the "read" command to prompt the user for input and stores it in the variable "input"
read -p "Please enter your favorite color: " input

# The script then uses the "if" statement to check if the user entered "blue" as their favorite color
if [ $input == "blue" ]; then
  # If they did, it uses the "echo" command to print a customized message
  echo "That's my favorite color too!"
else
  # If not, it uses the "echo" command to print a different message
  echo "That's a nice color, but mine is blue."
fi

# The script then uses the "for" loop to iterate through a list of numbers
for i in {1..5}; do
  # Within the loop, it uses the "echo" command to print each number squared
  echo "The square of $i is $((i*i))."
done

# Finally, it uses the "rm" command to remove a file named "temp.txt"
rm temp.txt
