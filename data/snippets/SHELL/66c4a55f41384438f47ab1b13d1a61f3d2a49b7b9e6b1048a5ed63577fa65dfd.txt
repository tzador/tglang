# The following snippet uses conditions, loops, and functions in shell

# Define a function that checks if a given number is even or odd
check_number() {
  if [ $(( $1 % 2 )) -eq 0 ]; # Check if the number's remainder after division by 2 is 0
  then # If so, it's even
    return 0 # Return 0 for even
  else
    return 1 # Return 1 for odd
  fi
}

# Use a loop to iterate through a list of numbers
for number in {1..10}; do
  # Call the check_number function and pass the current number as argument
  check_number $number
  # Store the return value in a variable
  is_even=$?

  # Check if the number is even or odd and print the result
  if [ $is_even -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "$number is even"
  else
    echo "$number is odd"
  fi
done

# Output:
# 1 is odd
# 2 is even
# 3 is odd
# 4 is even
# 5 is odd
# 6 is even
# 7 is odd
# 8 is even
# 9 is odd
# 10 is even
