# This is a Bash shell script that reads in two numbers and adds them.

echo "Enter first number:"
read num1
# prompts user to input first number and saves it in variable num1

echo "Enter second number:"
read num2
# prompts user to input second number and saves it in variable num2

sum=$(($num1 + $num2))
# creates variable sum and assigns it the value of num1 plus num2

echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is: $sum"
# outputs the sum of the two numbers
