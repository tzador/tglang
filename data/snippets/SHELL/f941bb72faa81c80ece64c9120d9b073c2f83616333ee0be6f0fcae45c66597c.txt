# This is a complex code snippet in SHELL language, it uses various commands and functions to perform a specific task

# Let's start by displaying a message to the user
echo "Welcome to the complex code snippet demonstration in SHELL language!"

# Now, we will ask the user for their name
echo "Please enter your name:"
read name

# Next, we will check if the user has entered a name or not
# If not, we will display an error message and exit the program
if [[ -z $name ]]; then
    echo "Error: No name entered, exiting program."
    exit 1
fi

# If the user has entered a name, we will proceed to perform some operations on it
# First, we will convert the name to uppercase letters using the 'tr' command
uppercase_name=$(echo $name | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')

# Then, we will calculate the length of the name using the 'wc' command
# We will use the '-c' flag to count the characters in the name
name_length=$(echo $name | wc -c)

# Next, we will print out the results to the user
echo "Dear $uppercase_name, your name has $name_length characters."

# Finally, we will create a directory with the user's name and display a success message
mkdir $uppercase_name
echo "Directory named $uppercase_name successfully created!"
