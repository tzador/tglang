# This is a complex code snippet in the SHELL programming language
# The following code creates a function that calculates the average of an array of numbers
average() {
    local sum=0 # Declaring a local variable that will hold the sum of all numbers
    local count=0 # Declaring a local variable that will hold the number of numbers in the array
    for num in "${@}" # Looping through all the numbers passed in as arguments
    do
        (( sum+=num )) # Adding each number to the sum variable
        (( count++ )) # Increasing the count variable by 1
    done
    local avg=$(bc <<< "scale=2; $sum/$count") # Using the bc calculator to calculate the average with 2 decimal places
    echo "The average of the array is $avg" # Printing out the average
}

# Example usage:
# Declare an array of numbers
arr=(4 2 8 10 6)
# Call the average function and pass in the array as arguments
average "${arr[@]}"

# Output: The average of the array is 6.00
