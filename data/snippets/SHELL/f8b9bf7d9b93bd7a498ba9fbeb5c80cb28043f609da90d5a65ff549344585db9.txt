# Explanation:
# This code snippet uses the SHELL programming language to calculate the average of a list of numbers.
# First, we declare an array called 'nums' and assign it a list of numbers.
# Next, we initialize 'sum' to 0 which will be used to store the total sum of the numbers.
# Then, we use a for loop to iterate through each number in the 'nums' array.
# For each iteration, we add the current number to the 'sum' variable using the '+= operator.
# After the loop, we use the '${#nums[@]}' syntax to get the length of the 'nums' array and use it to calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length.
# Finally, we use the 'echo' command to print out the calculated average.
