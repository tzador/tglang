#This code snippet demonstrates a shell script that creates a backup of a directory and its files

#Setting the current directory to where the script is located
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

#Creating a timestamp for the backup file name
timestamp=$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S)

#Creating a backup directory if it does not exist
if [ ! -d "backup" ]; then
    mkdir backup
fi

#Copying the directory and its files to the backup directory
cp -r directory backup/directory

#Compressing the backup directory into a zip file with the timestamp in its name
zip -r backup_${timestamp}.zip backup/directory

#Removing the uncompressed backup directory
rm -r backup/directory

#Outputting a success message
echo "Backup successfully created at backup_${timestamp}.zip"
