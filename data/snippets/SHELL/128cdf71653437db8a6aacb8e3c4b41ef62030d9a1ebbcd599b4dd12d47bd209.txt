# This is a complex code snippet in shell
# It creates a directory, changes into that directory, creates a file, appends text to the file, and displays the contents of the file

# Create a new directory 'example'
mkdir example

# Change into the 'example' directory
cd example

# Create a new file 'test.txt'
touch test.txt

# Append the text 'Hello World!' to the end of the file
echo "Hello World!" >> test.txt

# Display the contents of the file
cat test.txt
