# This is a Bash script to automate the process of checking website availability
# and returning a success message if the site is up or a failure message if it is down.

# Assign the URL to check as the first argument
URL="$1"

# Set a timeout value of 10 seconds
TIMEOUT="10"

# Perform a curl request to the given URL with a set timeout
curl -IsS --max-time "${TIMEOUT}" "${URL}" &>/dev/null

# Store the exit status of the curl request
STATUS="$?"

# If the exit status is zero (success), print a success message
if [[ "${STATUS}" -eq 0 ]]
then
  echo "Success! ${URL} is up and running."
# Otherwise, print a failure message
else
  echo "Failure! ${URL} is down."
