# This is a complex code snippet in the SHELL programming language
#
# This code snippet demonstrates how to iterate through a list of files
# and perform a series of operations on each file
#
# First, we will declare an array variable containing the filenames
files=("file1.txt" "file2.txt" "file3.txt")
# Next, we will iterate through the array using a for loop
for file in ${files[@]} 
do 
    # Inside the loop, we will print the current file being iterated
    echo "Processing file: $file"
    # We will then perform some operations on the file, such as replacing all instances of "foo" with "bar"
    sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' $file
    # We will also count the number of lines in the file and print it
    lines=$(wc -l < $file)
    echo "Number of lines: $lines"
done
# Finally, we will print a message indicating that all files have been processed
echo "All files have been processed!"
