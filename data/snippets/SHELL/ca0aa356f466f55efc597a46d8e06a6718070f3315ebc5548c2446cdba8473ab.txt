# This is a complex code snippet that implements a recursive function in shell

# Define a function named 'factorial' that takes in one argument 'n'
factorial() {
    # Check if 'n' is equal to 0
    if [ $1 -eq 0 ]; then
        # If 'n' is 0, return 1
        echo "1"
    else
        # If 'n' is not 0, calculate factorial for 'n - 1'
        # Store the result in a variable named 'temp'
        temp=`expr $1 - 1`
        # Call the 'factorial' function recursively with 'n - 1'
        factorial $temp
        # Store the result in a variable named 'result'
        result=$?
        # Multiply the 'result' variable with 'n' and store the result in 'final' variable
        final=`expr $1 \* $result`
        # Return the final result
        echo "$final"
    fi
}

# Call the 'factorial' function with input as 5
factorial 5

# Since the output is in a code snippet, the result will not be printed to the console
# The result for factorial of 5 is 120, which can be verified by calling the 'factorial' function with input as 5 in the terminal
