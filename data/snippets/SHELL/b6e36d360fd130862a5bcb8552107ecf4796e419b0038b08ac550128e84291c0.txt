# This is a complex code snippet in SHELL

# Define variables
# The variables below will be used to store information about a person
first_name="John"
last_name="Doe"
age=30
height=175
weight=80

# Print out information about the person
echo "Name: $first_name $last_name"
echo "Age: $age"
echo "Height: $height cm"
echo "Weight: $weight kg"

# Perform a calculation
# This will calculate the person's BMI using the formula BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (m^2)
# Note: In SHELL, floating point numbers are not supported, so we will use the 'bc' command-line calculator
bmi=$(echo "$weight / ($height/100)^2" | bc) # Calculate BMI and store in variable 'bmi'
echo "BMI: $bmi" # Print out calculated BMI

# Conditional statement
# This will check if the person's BMI is within the healthy range (18.5 - 24.9)
if (( $(echo "$bmi >= 18.5 && $bmi <= 24.9" | bc -l) )); then # Check if BMI is within range using the 'bc' command-line calculator
    echo "BMI is within the healthy range"
else
    echo "BMI is not within the healthy range"

# Loop
# This will iterate through a range of numbers and print them out
# Note: The 'seq' command is used to generate a sequence of numbers
for i in $(seq 1 10); do # Loop through numbers 1 to 10
