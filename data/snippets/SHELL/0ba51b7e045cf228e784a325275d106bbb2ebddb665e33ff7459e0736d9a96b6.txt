# This code snippet uses a for loop to iterate through a list of file names, checks if they exist,
# and prints the size of each file if it does.

file_list=("file1" "file2" "file3") # defines a list of file names

for i in "${file_list[@]}"; do #starts a for loop
  if [ -e "$i" ]; then #checks if file exists
    echo "File $i exists." #if exists, print a message
    filesize=$(wc -c < "$i") # gets the size of the file
    echo "File size is: $filesize" # prints the file size
  else
    echo "File $i does not exist." #if doesn't exist, print an error message
  fi
done #end of for loop
