#This code snippet demonstrates a for loop in shell
#The loop iterates through a list of numbers and prints them out

#Declaring the list of numbers as an array
nums=("1" "2" "3" "4" "5") 

#Initializing the for loop with the syntax "for element in list"
for num in ${nums[@]}
do
    #Printing each element in the array
    echo $num 
done
