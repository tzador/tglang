# This script takes in two numbers as command line arguments
# and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them

# Assigning command line arguments to variables
num1=$1
num2=$2

# Addition operation using 'expr' command
sum=`expr $num1 + $num2`

# Subtraction operation using arithmetic expression
difference=$((num1 - num2))

# Multiplication operation using 'let' command
let product=num1*num2

# Division operation using 'bc' command
quotient=`echo "scale=2; $num1/$num2" | bc`

# Printing the results
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum"

echo "The product of $num1 and $num2 is $product"
