# This is a complex code snippet in shell that uses conditional statements, loops, and user input to output a message
# First, we declare a variable 'age' and ask the user to input their age
read -p 'Please enter your age: ' age
# Next, we use a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18
if [[ $age -ge 18 ]]; then
  # If the age is greater than or equal to 18, we print a message welcoming the user to the adult club
  echo "Welcome to the adult club!"
# If the age is less than 18, we use a loop to continuously prompt the user to input their age until it is valid
else
  echo "Sorry, you are not yet an adult. Please try again."
  # We set the variable 'valid' to false to indicate that the age is not valid
  valid=false
  # While the age is not valid, we keep prompting the user to input their age
  while [ "$valid" == "false" ]; do
    read -p 'Please enter your age: ' age
    # Once the age is valid, we change the value of 'valid' to true to exit the loop
    if [[ $age -ge 18 ]]; then
      valid=true
      # We print a message welcoming the user to the adult club
      echo "Welcome to the adult club!"
    fi
  done
fi
# Finally, we use another conditional statement to check if the user's age is a multiple of 10
if [[ $((age % 10)) -eq 0 ]]; then
  # If it is a multiple of 10, we print a congratulatory message
  echo "Congratulations for reaching a milestone age of $age!"
