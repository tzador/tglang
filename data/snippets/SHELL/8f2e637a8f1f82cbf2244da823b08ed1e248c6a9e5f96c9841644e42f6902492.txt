# This code snippet creates a while loop that counts from 1 to 10
counter=1 # Set counter variable equal to 1
while [ $counter -le 10 ] # Begin while loop, will continue as long as counter is less than or equal to 10
do
    echo "Count: $counter" # Print out the current value of counter
    counter=$((counter+1)) # Increment counter by 1
done # End of while loop
echo "Loop finished"
