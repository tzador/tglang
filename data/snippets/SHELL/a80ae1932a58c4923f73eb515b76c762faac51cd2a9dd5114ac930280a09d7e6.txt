# This code snippet creates a function that checks for the existence of a file in a given directory.
# The function takes in two parameters:
# # "$1" is the file path
# # "$2" is the directory path
# The function first checks if the given directory exists.
# If it does not exist, an error message is printed and the function exits.
# If the directory exists, it then checks if the file exists in the directory.
# If the file exists, a success message is printed.
# If the file does not exist, an error message is printed.
# Finally, the function returns the exit code based on whether the file exists or not.

    directory="$2"

            echo "File exists!"
            return 0
        else
            echo "File does not exist!"
