# This code snippet creates a function to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion in Shell

# Define a function named "factorial" which takes one argument "n"
factorial() {
    # If the value of "n" is equal to 0 or 1, return 1
    if [ $1 -eq 0 ] || [ $1 -eq 1 ]; then
        return 1
    else
        # If the value of "n" is greater than 1, recursively call the factorial function with "n-1"
        # and multiply it by the current value of "n"
        return $(( $1 * $( factorial $(($1 - 1)) ) ))
    fi
}

# Prompt the user to enter a number
echo "Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "
# Read the user input and store it in a variable named "number"
read number

# Call the factorial function with the user input and store the result in a variable named "result"
result=$( factorial $number )

# Display the result
echo "The factorial of $number is $result."
