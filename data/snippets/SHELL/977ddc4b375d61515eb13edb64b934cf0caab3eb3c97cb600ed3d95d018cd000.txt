#This is a script to calculate the factorial of a given number using a recursive function

#First we define the recursive function 'factorial'
#This function takes in a single argument, the number whose factorial we want to find
#It calls itself recursively until the argument becomes 1, then it returns the final result
factorial() {
  if [[ $1 -eq 1 ]]
  then
    echo 1
  else
    local temp=$(( $1 - 1 ))
	#Here we are using command substitution and arithmetic expansion to call the function recursively
	#The returned value is stored in the 'result' variable
	#The 'temp' variable is used to decrement the argument by 1 in each iteration
    local result=$(factorial $temp)
	#Finally, we multiply the current argument with the returned value from the recursive call to get the final result
    echo $(( $1 * $result ))
  fi
}

#After defining the function, we prompt the user to enter a number
echo "Enter a number:"
read num

#We then call the function 'factorial' with the user input as the argument and store the result in a variable
#The 'num' variable is used to pass the user input to the function
result=$(factorial $num)

#Finally, we print the result to the user
echo "The factorial of $num is $result"

#Sample Output:
#Enter a number:
#5
#The factorial of 5 is 120
