# This code snippet is a shell script that loops through a list of files, checks if they are directories, and if so, lists the files inside.

#! /bin/bash

# store list of files in variable
files="file1.txt file2.txt dir1 dir2.txt"

# loop through files
for f in $files; do

    # check if file is a directory
    if [ -d "$f" ]; then
        echo "Files inside $f:"

        # list the files inside the directory
        ls "$f"
    fi
done

# Output:
# Files inside dir1:
# file3.txt
# file4.txt
# file5.txt

# Files inside dir2.txt:
# file6.txt
# file7.txt
# file8.txt
# file9.txt
