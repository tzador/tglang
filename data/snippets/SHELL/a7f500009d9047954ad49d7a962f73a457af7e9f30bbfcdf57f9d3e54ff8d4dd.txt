# This is a shell script that prints the sum of two numbers
# taken as command line arguments

# Storing the first number in a variable
num1=$1

# Storing the second number in a variable
num2=$2

# Using the expr command to perform addition and store the result in a variable
sum=`expr $num1 + $num2`

# Printing the result
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is: $sum"

# Example command line input: ./sum.sh 5 10
# Example output: "The sum of 5 and 10 is: 15"
