# This is a shell script that utilizes the awk command to process a CSV file and output the results in a new file called "output.txt"

# Create a variable for the name of the CSV file
input="data.csv"

# Create a new file called "output.txt" to store the results
output="output.txt"

# Use the awk command to process the CSV file and extract specific columns
awk -F"," '{print $1,$2}' $input > $output

# Use the awk command again to add a header to the new file
awk 'BEGIN {print "First Name\tLast Name"} {print $0}' $output > output2.txt

# Print a success message
echo "Data has been processed and outputted to output.txt and output2.txt"
