# This code snippet executes a shell script that generates a report on disk usage

#!/bin/bash                         # Starts the shell script with the bash interpreter
output_dir="reports"                # Sets an output directory for the generated report
report_name="disk_usage_report.txt" # Sets a name for the report file

mkdir "$output_dir"                 # Creates the output directory if it doesn't exist
df -h > "$output_dir/$report_name"  # Runs the 'df' command to show disk usage and saves the output to the report file
echo "Disk usage report generated at: $output_dir/$report_name" # Prints a confirmation message

#This code snippet is useful for monitoring disk usage and can be scheduled to run regularly as a part of system maintenance.
