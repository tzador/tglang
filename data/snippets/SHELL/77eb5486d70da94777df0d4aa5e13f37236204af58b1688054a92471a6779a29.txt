# This is a sample code snippet in the programming language 'SHELL'
# This program takes two numbers and performs different mathematical operations on them.

# Defining the main function
main() {

    # Setting the value for the first number
    num1=10

    # Setting the value for the second number
    num2=5

    # Adding the two numbers and storing the result in a variable
    sum=$(($num1 + $num2))

    # Printing the result
    echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum"

    # Subtracting the second number from the first and storing the result in a variable
    difference=$(($num1 - $num2))

    # Printing the result
    echo "The difference between $num1 and $num2 is $difference"

    # Multiplying the two numbers and storing the result in a variable
    product=$(($num1 * $num2))

    # Printing the result
    echo "The product of $num1 and $num2 is $product"

    # Dividing the first number by the second and storing the result in a variable
    quotient=$((num1 / num2))

    # Printing the result
    echo "The quotient of $num1 divided by $num2 is $quotient"
}

# Calling the main function
