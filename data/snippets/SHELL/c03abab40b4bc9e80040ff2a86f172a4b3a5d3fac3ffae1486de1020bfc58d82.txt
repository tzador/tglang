# This is a sample code snippet in SHELL that creates a for loop 
# to print out numbers from 1 to 10.
# The loop uses an if statement to check for even numbers, 
# and only prints them if the condition is met.

#!/bin/bash

# Setting a variable to store the limit
limit=10

# For loop that iterates from 1 to the limit
for (( i=1; i<=limit; i++ ))
do
    if (( i % 2 == 0 )) # Checking if the number is even 
    then
        echo $i # Printing the number if even
    fi
done
