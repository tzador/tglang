# This is a shell script that demonstrates how to perform a complex task.

# First, we set some variables for convenience.
# These variables should be modified to fit your specific use case.

# Input file name
input_file="input.txt"

# Output file name
output_file="output.txt"

# Temporary file name
temp_file="temp.txt"

# Next, we check if the input file exists.
if [ -f "$input_file" ]
then
    echo "Input file exists. Continuing..."    
else
    echo "Input file does not exist. Aborting script."
    exit 1
fi

# Now, we will do some complicated processing on the input file.
# In this example, we will count the number of lines in the file.

# First, we will use the 'wc' command to get the number of lines.
# We will use the '-l' flag to only count lines.
num_lines=$(wc -l < $input_file)

# Next, we will remove any leading or trailing whitespace using 'tr' and 'sed'.
# This will ensure that our variable only contains the number of lines.
num_lines=$(echo $num_lines | tr -d '[:space:]')
num_lines=$(echo $num_lines | sed 's/^ *//;s/ *$//')

# Now, we will perform some mathematical operations on the number of lines.
# Here, we will multiply the number of lines by 2 and add 5.
# We will use the 'bc' (basic calculator) command to perform these operations.
num_lines=$(echo "($num_lines * 2) + 5" | bc)

# Finally, we will use a loop to print out the final result to the output file.
# We will use the 'seq' command to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to our final result.
# Then, we will use 'awk' to print the line numbers and the final result on each line.
seq 1 $num_lines | awk '{print $0" - Final result: " '$num_lines' }' > $output_file

# Cleanup: we will delete the temporary file.
rm $temp_file
