# This is a code snippet that generates a random number between 1 and 100 in SHELL

# Set a variable to hold the upper limit of the random number range
UPPER_LIMIT=100

# Set a variable to hold the lower limit of the random number range
LOWER_LIMIT=1

# Use the 'shuf' command to generate a random number within the specified range
# The '-i' flag sets the range, and the '-n 1' flag outputs only one number
# The 'head' command is used to strip any extra characters from the output
# and the 'echo' command is used to print the result to the console
echo $(shuf -i $LOWER_LIMIT-$UPPER_LIMIT -n 1 | head -n 1)
