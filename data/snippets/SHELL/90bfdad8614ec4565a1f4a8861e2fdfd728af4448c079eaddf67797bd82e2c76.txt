# This code snippet is a simple for loop in bash that checks if a file exists and prints its contents if it does.
# The loop iterates over multiple files and uses conditional statements to handle errors.

# Declaring an array of file names
files=("file1" "file2" "file3")

# Looping through the array
for file in "${files[@]}"
do
    # Check if file exists
    if [ -f "$file" ]
    then
        # Print file contents
        cat "$file"
    else
        # Error message if file doesn't exist
        echo "File $file does not exist"
    fi
done
