# This is a complex code snippet in SHELL
# It employs the use of loops, conditionals, and arrays to generate a list of prime numbers

# declare an array to store the prime numbers
prime_numbers=()

# prompt user to input the range of numbers to check for prime numbers
echo "Enter the starting and ending numbers to check for prime numbers: "
read starting_number ending_number

# loop through the range of numbers provided by the user 
for (( i=starting_number; i<=ending_number; i++ ))
do
    # initialize a counter to count how many times the current number is divisible
    counter=0

    # loop through the numbers less than or equal to the current number
    for (( j=1; j<=i; j++ ))
    do
        # check if the current number is divisible and increment the counter if it is
        if [ $((i%j)) -eq 0 ]; then
            counter=$((counter+1))
        fi
    done

    # if the number is only divisible by 1 and itself, it is a prime number
    if [ $counter -eq 2 ]; then
        # add the number to the array of prime numbers
        prime_numbers+=($i)
    fi
done

# print out the list of prime numbers
echo "Prime numbers from $starting_number to $ending_number are: ${prime_numbers[@]}"
