# This is a sample code snippet in the SHELL programming language
# It computes the factorial of a given number using a for loop

# User input
echo "Enter a number: "
read num

# Initializing factorial variable
fact=1

# Loop to compute factorial
for ((i=1; i<=num; i++)); do
  fact=$((fact * i))
done

# Printing the result
echo "Factorial of $num is $fact"
