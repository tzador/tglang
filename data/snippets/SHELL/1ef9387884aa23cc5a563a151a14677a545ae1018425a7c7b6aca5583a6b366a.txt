# This is a complex code snippet in SHELL

# Define a function
function my_function() {
    # Create an array
    my_array=(1 2 3 4 5)

    # Loop through the array
    for num in "${my_array[@]}"
    do
        # Check for even numbers
        if [ $(expr "$num" % 2) -eq 0 ]
        then
            # Print the number
            echo "$num is even"
        else
            # Print the number and its square
            echo "$num is odd, its square is $(expr "$num" \* "$num")"

    done

    # Set a variable
    my_var="Hello World"

    # Print the variable
    echo "$my_var"

    # Conditionals
    if [ "$my_var" = "Hello World" ]
    then
        # Print a message
        echo "The variable is equal to Hello World"
    else
        # Print a different message
        echo "The variable is not equal to Hello World"

}

# Call the function
my_function

# Output:
# 1 is odd, its square is 1
# 2 is even
# 3 is odd, its square is 9
# 4 is even
# 5 is odd, its square is 25
# Hello World
# The variable is equal to Hello World
