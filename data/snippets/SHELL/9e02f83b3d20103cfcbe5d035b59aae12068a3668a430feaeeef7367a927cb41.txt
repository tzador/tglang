# This is a basic Bash shell script
# that prints the current date and time
# First, we define a variable to store the current date
cur_date=`date`

# Then, we print a greeting to the user
echo "Hello user, welcome to my script!"

# Now, we print the current date and time
echo "The current date and time is: $cur_date."
