# This is a complex code snippet that creates a bash function called 'file_manipulation'
# The function takes in two arguments, $1 and $2, and performs multiple file manipulation tasks
# within a single directory.

# Defining the function 'file_manipulation'
file_manipulation () {
    # Checking if the directory exists
    if [ -d "$1" ]; then
        # Swapping the current working directory with the given directory
        cd "$1"

        mkdir files
        # Moving all files from the current directory to the 'files' directory
        mv * files 
        # Removing any empty subdirectories
        rmdir */* 2>/dev/null
        # Looping through the 'files' directory to rename files and directories
        for file in files/*; do
            # Checking if the file is a directory
            if [ -d "$file" ]; then
                # Renaming the directory by adding '_dir' suffix
                mv "$file" "${file}_dir"
            else
                # Renaming the file by adding '.txt' extension
                mv "$file" "$file.txt"
            fi
        done
        # Zipping the 'files' directory
        zip -r files.zip files
