# This program calculates the factorial of a number

# Function to calculate factorial of a number
factorial() {

  # Takes in user input and assigns it to a variable
  read -p "Enter a number: " num
  result=1
  
  # For loop to iterate through the numbers and calculate the factorial
  for (( i=1; i<=num; i++ ))
  do
    # Multiplies the current result by the current number in the loop
    result=$(($result*i))
  done
  
  # Prints the result
  echo "The factorial of $num is $result"
  
}

# Calls the factorial function
factorial

# Sample output:
# Enter a number: 5
# The factorial of 5 is 120
