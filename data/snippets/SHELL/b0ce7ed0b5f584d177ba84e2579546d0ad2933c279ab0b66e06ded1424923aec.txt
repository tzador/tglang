#!/bin/bash   #set the interpreter for the script
# This is a shell script to print the current date and time
# First, we set the variables for the current date and time using the `date` command
curr_date=$(date '+%m/%d/%Y')  #sets the date format to month/day/year
curr_time=$(date '+%H:%M:%S')  #sets the time format to hour:minute:second

# Next, we use the `echo` command to print the current date and time
echo "Current Date: $curr_date"
echo "Current Time: $curr_time"

# We can also use the `whoami` command to print the current user
user=$(whoami)
echo "Current User: $user"  #prints the current user

# Next, we create a variable for the current directory using the `pwd` command
curr_dir=$(pwd)

# We can print the contents of the current directory using the `ls` command
echo "Contents of Current Directory: "
ls $curr_dir

# We can also use the `wc` command to count the number of files in the current directory
num_files=$(ls | wc -l) #uses `ls` to list files and `wc -l` to count number of lines (i.e. files)

echo "Total Number of Files in Current Directory: $num_files"

# Finally, we can use the `uptime` command to display the current system uptime
uptime=$(uptime | awk '{print $3}') #uses `uptime` and `awk` to print only the system uptime value

echo "System Uptime: $uptime"
