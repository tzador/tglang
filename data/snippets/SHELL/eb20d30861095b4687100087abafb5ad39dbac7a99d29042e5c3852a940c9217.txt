## This code snippet creates a function for calculating the factorial of a number
## It takes in a number as an argument and returns the factorial value

function factorial {
    if (($1 <= 1)) { # checks if the number is less than or equal to 1
        return 1 # returns 1 if the number is 1 or 0
    }
    factorial=$((factorial $((num - 1)) * $num)) # recursively calls the factorial function with the argument decreased by 1 and multiplies it with the current number
    return $factorial # returns the final factorial value
} 

num=5 # sets the number for which factorial needs to be calculated
factorial $num # calls the factorial function with the defined number
echo "Factorial of $num is $?" # prints the result
