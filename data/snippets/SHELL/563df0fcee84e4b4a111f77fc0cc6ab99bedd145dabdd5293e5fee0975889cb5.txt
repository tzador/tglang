#The following code is a Shell script for creating a backup of a directory
#First, we declare variables for the source directory and the backup directory
src_dir="/home/user/docs"
backup_dir="/home/user/backup"

#Next, we create a new directory in the backup directory with the current timestamp
mkdir "$backup_dir/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")"

#Then, we use the 'find' command to copy files from the source directory to the backup directory
#We use the 'exec' option to execute the 'cp' command on each file
find "$src_dir" -type f -exec cp {} "$backup_dir/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")" \;

#Next, we compress the backup directory using the 'tar' command and the current timestamp in the file name
tar -czf "$backup_dir/backup_$(date +"%Y-%m-%d").tar.gz" "$backup_dir/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")"

#Finally, we delete the newly created directory in the backup directory, leaving only the compressed backup file
rm -rf "$backup_dir/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")"
