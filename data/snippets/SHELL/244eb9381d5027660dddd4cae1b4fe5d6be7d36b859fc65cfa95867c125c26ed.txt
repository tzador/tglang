# This is a sample bash script that creates a directory and moves a file into it
# It also uses a for loop to iterate through a list of numbers and prints them out

#!/bin/bash
# Set variable for directory name
DIRECTORY="my_directory"

# Create directory if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -d "$DIRECTORY" ]; then
  mkdir "$DIRECTORY"
fi

# Move file into directory
mv myfile.txt $DIRECTORY/

# Set list of numbers
NUMBERS="1 2 3 4 5"

# Iterate through numbers using for loop
for num in $NUMBERS; do
  echo "Number: $num"
done
