# This is a shell script that takes in two numbers from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations on them.
# This script uses functions to perform the arithmetic operations.

# Function to add two numbers
add() {
  # The result variable will hold the sum
  result=$(( $1 + $2 ))
  # Print the result to the terminal
  echo "The sum of $1 and $2 is $result"
}

# Function to subtract two numbers
subtract() {
  # The result variable will hold the difference
  result=$(( $1 - $2 ))
  # Print the result to the terminal
  echo "The difference between $1 and $2 is $result"
}

# Function to multiply two numbers
multiply() {
  # The result variable will hold the product
  result=$(( $1 * $2 ))
  # Print the result to the terminal
  echo "The product of $1 and $2 is $result"
}

# Function to divide two numbers
divide() {
  # The result variable will hold the quotient
  result=$(( $1 / $2 ))
  # Print the result to the terminal
  echo "The result of dividing $1 by $2 is $result"
}

# Get the first number from the user
echo "Enter the first number: "
read first_num
# Get the second number from the user
echo "Enter the second number: "
read second_num

# Call the add function and pass in the two numbers as arguments
add $first_num $second_num
# Call the subtract function and pass in the two numbers as arguments
subtract $first_num $second_num
# Call the multiply function and pass in the two numbers as arguments
multiply $first_num $second_num
# Call the divide function and pass in the two numbers as arguments
divide $first_num $second_num

# Output:
# The sum of 4 and 2 is 6
# The difference between 4 and 2 is 2
# The product of 4 and 2 is 8
# The result of dividing 4 by 2 is 2
