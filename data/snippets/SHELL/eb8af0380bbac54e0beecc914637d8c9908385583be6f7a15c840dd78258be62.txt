# this is a complex code snippet that uses a combination of different shell scripting concepts

# first, we declare a variable and assign a string value to it
var="Hello, world!"

# next, we use a for loop to iterate through the string characters
for (( i=0; i<${#var}; i++ )); do
    # we use an if statement to check if the character is equal to a comma
    if [[ "${var:$i:1}" == "," ]]; then
        # if it is, we use the continue statement to skip to the next iteration
        continue
    fi
    # otherwise, we print out the character and its corresponding index 
    echo "Character at index $i is: ${var:$i:1}"
    
    # after the loop is completed, we use a switch statement to check the last character
    case "${var:$i:1}" in
        "d")
            # if the character is equal to "d", we print out a message indicating it
            echo "Found the letter 'd' at the end!"
            ;;
        *)
            # otherwise, we print out a different message indicating it
            echo "The last character is not 'd'."
            ;;
    esac
done

# finally, we use the read command to prompt for user input and store it in a variable
read -p "Please enter your name: " name

# we then use a while loop to repeatedly print out the user's input until they stop the loop
while true; do
    # we use the read command again to check for user input
    read -p "Do you want to see your name again? (y/n): " answer
    
    # within the loop, we use a case statement to check the user's response
    case $answer in
        # if the user inputs "y", we print out their name
        "y")
            echo "Your name is: $name"
            ;;
        # if the user inputs "n", we break out of the loop
        "n")
            break
            ;;
        # for any other input, we display an error message
        *)
            echo "Invalid input, please try again."
            ;;
