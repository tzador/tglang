#Defining variables for the source directory and the name of the archive:
source_dir="/home/user/documents"
archive_name="documents_archive.tar.gz"

#Creating the archive using the tar command:
tar -zcvf $archive_name $source_dir

#Verifying the archive was created successfully:
if [ -f $archive_name ]; then
  echo "Archive created successfully!"

  echo "Error creating archive."
fi

#Optional: Deleting the source directory after creating the archive:
if [ -d $source_dir ]; then
  rm -r $source_dir
  echo "Source directory deleted."
