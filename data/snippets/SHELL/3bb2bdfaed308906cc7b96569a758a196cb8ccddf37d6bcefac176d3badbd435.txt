# This script prints "Hello World" to the console
echo "Hello World"    # echoes (prints) the string "Hello World"
# We can also use variables to store data
name="John"           # creates the variable "name" and stores the string "John" in it
echo "Hello $name"    # echoes the string "Hello" followed by the value stored in the variable "name"
# We can also use control structures such as if statements
if [ $name = "John" ] # checks if the value in the variable "name" is equal to "John"
then                  # indicates the start of the code to be executed if the if statement is true
echo "You are John"   # echoes the string "You are John"
else                  # indicates the start of the code to be executed if the if statement is false
echo "You are not John" # echoes the string "You are not John"
fi                    # indicates the end of the control structure
# Lastly, we can use loops to repeat certain actions
for num in 1 2 3      # creates a loop that will iterate three times, each time with the variable "num" having a value of 1, 2, or 3
do                    # indicates the start of the code to be repeated in the loop
echo "The number is $num" # echoes the string "The number is" followed by the value stored in the variable "num"
done                  # indicates the end of the loop
