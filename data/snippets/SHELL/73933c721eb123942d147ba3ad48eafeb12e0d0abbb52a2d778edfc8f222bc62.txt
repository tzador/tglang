# This code snippet uses a for loop to iterate through a list of numbers and create a new array with the square of each number
SHELL

# Define an array of numbers
numbers=(1 2 3 4 5)

# Define an empty array to store the squared numbers
squared_numbers=()

# Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers array
for num in "${numbers[@]}"
do
    # Use the expr command to multiply the current number by itself and assign it to a variable
    squared_num=$(expr $num \* $num)

    # Add the squared number to the squared_numbers array
    squared_numbers+=($squared_num)

done # end of for loop

# Print the squared_numbers array
echo "The squared numbers are: ${squared_numbers[@]}"
