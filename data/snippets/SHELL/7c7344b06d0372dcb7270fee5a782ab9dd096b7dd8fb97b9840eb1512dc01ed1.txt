# Define a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
factorial() {
  # Initialize the result variable to 1
  result=1

  # Use for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to the given number
  for ((i=1; i<=$1; i++))
  do
    # Multiply the current result by the current number
    result=$((result * i))
  done

  # Print the result
  echo "Factorial of $1 is: $result"
}

# Call the function with a given number
factorial 5

# Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120
