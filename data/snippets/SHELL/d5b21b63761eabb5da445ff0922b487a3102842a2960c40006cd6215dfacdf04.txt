# This code snippet uses a nested for loop to generate a multiplication table.
# First, we define a variable to hold the number of rows and columns we want in our table.
size=9

# Next, we use a for loop to iterate through every row.
for i in {1..size}
do
  # Within each row, we use another for loop to iterate through every column and generate the multiplication result.
  for j in {1..size}
  do
    # The multiplication result is calculated by multiplying the row number with the column number.
    result=$((i*j))

    # We use printf to print the result, with a spacing of 4 characters to align the table.
    printf "%4d" $result
  done
  # After generating all the columns in a row, we add a line break to move to the next row.
  echo
