# This is a sample code snippet in SHELL
# It assigns a value to a variable, runs a for loop, and uses conditionals

# Assigning a value to a variable
message="Hello World"

# Creating a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 10
for i in {1..10}
do
  # Using conditionals to check if i is even or odd
  if [ $(($i%2)) -eq 0 ]
  then
    # If i is even, print the message variable with even appended
    echo "$message even"
  else
    # If i is odd, print the message variable with odd appended
    echo "$message odd"
  fi
