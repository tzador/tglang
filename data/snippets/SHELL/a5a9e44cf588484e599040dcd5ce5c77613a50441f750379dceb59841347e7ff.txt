# This is a long and complex code snippet in SHELL.
# It uses variables, control structures, and function definitions.

# Declare a variable called "name" and assign it a value.
name = "John Smith"

# Use an if statement to check if the value of "name" is equal to "John Smith".
if [ "$name" = "John Smith" ]; then

    # If the condition is true, print a message.
    echo "Welcome, John Smith!"

    # Use a for loop to iterate through a list of numbers.
    for num in {1..5}; do

        # Print the number.
        echo $num

    # End the for loop.
    done

# Use an else statement for when the condition is not met.
else

    # Print an error message.
    echo "Sorry, you are not allowed access."

# End the if statement.

# Define a function called "sum" that takes in two numbers as arguments.
