#This code snippet creates a function that calculates the average of a given set of numbers

#Function to calculate average
average() {
    #Creating an array with the given set of numbers
    numbers=(5 6 7 8 9)

    #Initializing a variable to store the sum of numbers
    sum=0

    #Using for loop to iterate through the array
    for num in "${numbers[@]}"
    do
        #Adding each number in the array to the sum variable
        #using arithmetic expansion
        sum=$((sum + num))
    done

    #Calculating the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
    #Using ${#array[@]} to get the number of elements in the array
    avg=$((sum / ${#numbers[@]}))

    #Printing the result to the console
    echo "The average of the numbers is: $avg"
}

#Calling the function to calculate average
