#This is a shell script that checks if a file exists and if it does, it will print out the first ten lines of the file.

#First, we need to pass in the file path as an argument when running the script
#Example: bash script.sh /path/to/file.txt

file_path=$1 #Assigning the first argument as the file path variable

if [[ -f $file_path ]]; then #Check if the file exists
    echo "File '$file_path' exists." #Print out file name
    echo "Printing first 10 lines of the file:" #Print out message before printing lines
    head -n 10 $file_path #Print first ten lines of the file
else
    echo "File '$file_path' does not exist." #Print out file name
