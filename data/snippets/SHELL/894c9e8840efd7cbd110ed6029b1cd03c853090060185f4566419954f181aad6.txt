# This is a code snippet in Shell
# It uses loops and conditional statements to print out a list of even numbers

# Declare a variable to store the maximum number
max_num=50

# Use for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to max_num
for ((i=1; i<=max_num; i++))
do
    # Use conditional statement to check if the current number is even
    # If the remainder after dividing by 2 is 0, then it is even
    if ((i%2 == 0))
    then
        # Print out the even number
        echo $i
    fi
done

# Output:
# An annotated code snippet to print out a list of even numbers up to a maximum number.
