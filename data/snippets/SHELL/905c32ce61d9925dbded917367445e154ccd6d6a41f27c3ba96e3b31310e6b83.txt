# This is a long and complex code snippet written in the SHELL/ bash programming language.
# It will create a backup file and compress it using tar and gzip commands.

# Assign variables
source_file="textfile.txt" # This is the name of the file we want to backup
backup_dir="/home/user/backups" # This is the directory where we want to store the backup

# Create and enter backup directory
mkdir "$backup_dir"
cd "$backup_dir"

# Create a new directory for the backup
backup_date=$(date +%Y%m%d) # Use current date as name of the backup directory
mkdir "$backup_date"

# Copy source file to backup directory
cp "../$source_file" "./$backup_date"

# Compress backup directory using tar and gzip
cd "$backup_date"
tar -czvf backup.tar.gz . # Compress all files in this directory
cd ..

# Print success message
echo "Backup of $source_file created successfully in $backup_dir/$backup_date!"
