# This script performs a series of complex tasks
# and outputs the results to a file.

#step 1: create an array of filenames
files=("file1.txt" "file2.txt" "file3.txt")

#step 2: create a directory to store the output
mkdir output_directory

#step 3: loop through the array of filenames
for i in "${files[@]}"; do
    #step 4: grep for specific words in the file and redirect the output to a new file
    grep "word1" "$i" > "output_directory/$i_new.txt"
    grep "word2" "$i" >> "output_directory/$i_new.txt"
done

#step 5: print a message to indicate the completion of the task
echo "Task completed successfully!"

#step 6: compress the output directory into a zip file
zip -r output.zip output_directory

#step 7: remove the output directory
rm -rf output_directory
