# This code snippet uses the 'for loop' command to run a certain command multiple times
# The 'for loop' here iterates through a list of numbers and uses them as arguments for the 'ls' command
# The output is then redirected to a text file named 'file_list.txt'

for i in {1..10}; do
  ls -l "$i" > file_list.txt
