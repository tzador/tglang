# This is a code snippet in the SHELL programming language
# It is a simple script for computing the factorial of a given number

# Function to calculate factorial
factorial() {
    # Set initial value of factorial to 1
    factorial=1
    # For loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to given number
    for (( i=1; i<=$1; i++ ))
    do
        # Multiply factorial by current number
        factorial=$(( $factorial * $i ))
    done
    # Print the result
    echo "The factorial of $1 is $factorial"
}

# Get input from user
echo "Enter a number: "
read num
# Call the factorial function with input number as parameter
factorial $num

# Output:
# Enter a number:
# 5
# The factorial of 5 is 120
