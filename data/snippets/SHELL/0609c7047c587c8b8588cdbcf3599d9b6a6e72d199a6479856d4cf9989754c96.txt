#!/bin/sh

# This is a complex code snippet, demonstrating shell scripting in Unix-based systems.

# This script takes in two inputs, a directory path and a file prefix, and outputs a list of files
# in that directory that have the given prefix.

# First, we prompt the user for the directory path and store it in the 'dir' variable.
echo "Enter directory path: "
read dir

# Next, we prompt the user for the file prefix and store it in the 'prefix' variable.
echo "Enter file prefix: "
read prefix

# We then go into the given directory and loop through all the files using the 'for' loop.
cd $dir
for file in *
do
    # We use the 'if' statement to check if the file name starts with the given prefix.
    if [[ $file == ${prefix}* ]]; then
        # If it does, we print the file name to the terminal.
        echo $file
    fi
done

# Finally, we exit the script with a success status of 0.
exit 0
