# This is a shell script that takes in two numbers, performs mathematical operations on them, and prints the result 
# ----- INPUT -----
# Enter first number: 5
# Enter second number: 3

# ----- LOGIC -----
# Declaring variables and assigning them the values entered by the user
num1=5
num2=3
 
# Performing mathematical operations on the numbers
add=$(expr $num1 + $num2) # adds the two numbers together
sub=$(expr $num1 - $num2) # subtracts the second number from the first number
mul=$(expr $num1 \* $num2) # multiplies the two numbers together
div=$(expr $num1 / $num2) # divides the first number by the second number and returns only the quotient
rem=$(expr $num1 % $num2) # divides the first number by the second number and returns only the remainder
 
# ----- OUTPUT -----
# Printing the results of the calculations
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $add"
echo "The difference between $num1 and $num2 is $sub"
echo "The product of $num1 and $num2 is $mul"
echo "The quotient when $num1 is divided by $num2 is $div"
echo "The remainder when $num1 is divided by $num2 is $rem"

# Output:
# The sum of 5 and 3 is 8
# The difference between 5 and 3 is 2
# The product of 5 and 3 is 15
# The quotient when 5 is divided by 3 is 1
# The remainder when 5 is divided by 3 is 2
