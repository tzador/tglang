# This is a complex code snippet in SHELL
# It checks for the existence of a file with a given name
# and creates it if it doesn't exist

# First, we declare a variable for the file name
file_name="example.txt"

# Next, we check if the file exists using the 'test' command
# If it doesn't exist, the 'test' command returns 1
if [ ! -f $file_name ]; then
    # If the file doesn't exist, we use the 'touch' command
    # to create a new file with the given name
    touch $file_name

    # We can also add some content to the file using 'echo'
    echo "This file was created using SHELL scripting" >> $file_name
fi

# Finally, we can print a success message to the terminal
echo "File $file_name was successfully created"

# The output of this code snippet will be:
# File example.txt was successfully created
