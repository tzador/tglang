# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number

echo "Enter a number:" # prompts user for a number
read num # reads input from user
factorial=1 # initializes factorial variable to 1

# loop to calculate factorial
# uses 'seq' command to create a series of natural numbers from 1 to 'num'
# uses 'bc' command to perform arithmetic operations
for i in `seq 1 $num`
do
  factorial=$(echo "$factorial * $i" | bc) # multiplies current factorial value with current number
done

echo "Factorial of $num is $factorial" # prints the result
