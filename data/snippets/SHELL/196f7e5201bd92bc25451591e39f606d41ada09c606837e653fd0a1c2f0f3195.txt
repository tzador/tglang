# This is a long and complex code snippet in shell
# It demonstrates the use of variables, arrays, loops and functions

# Define an array of names
names=("John" "Mary" "Adam" "Emily")

# Define a function to print the length of each name
print_length() {
    # Loop through the array
    for name in "${names[@]}"
    do
        # Calculate the length of the name
        length=${#name}
        # Print the name and its length
        echo "$name has a length of $length"
    done
}

# Define a function to reverse the order of the names in the array
reverse_names() {
    # Initialize an empty array to store the reversed names
    reversed_names=()
    # Loop through the array in reverse order
    for (( i=${#names[@]}-1; i>=0; i-- ))
    do
        # Add each name to the new array
        reversed_names+=("${names[i]}")
    done

    # Print the reversed array
    echo "The reversed array is: ${reversed_names[@]}"
}

# Call the print_length function
print_length
# Call the reverse_names function
reverse_names

# Output:
# John has a length of 4
# Mary has a length of 4
# Adam has a length of 4
# Emily has a length of 5
# The reversed array is: Emily Adam Mary John
