#This code snippet creates a for loop that iterates through a list of files ending in .txt and replaces all instances of "hello" with "greetings"

#Creates a list of all .txt files in the current directory and saves it to a variable called "files"
files=( *.txt )

#Starts a for loop that iterates through each file in the "files" list
for file in "${files[@]}"
do
  #Uses the "sed" tool to replace all instances of "hello" with "greetings" in the current file and saves it to a temporary file called "new_file"
  sed 's/hello/greetings/g' "$file" > new_file
  
  #Moves the temporary file to overwrite the original file
  mv new_file "$file"
