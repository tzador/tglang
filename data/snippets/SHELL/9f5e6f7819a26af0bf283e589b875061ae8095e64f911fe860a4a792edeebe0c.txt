#!/bin/bash

# This is a shell script that uses awk to process a CSV file and output data in a formatted table
# It takes in a CSV file as an argument and uses AWK to format and print the data in a table

csv_file="$1" # Takes in CSV file as argument

# AWK command to format the data in the CSV file
# -F is used to specify that the input is a CSV file
# OFS (Output Field Separator) is set to '|' to separate the columns in the table
# NR (Number of Records) is used to skip the first row (which contains column names)
# FNR (File Number of the Current Record) is used to skip the first column (which contains row numbers)
# $1, $2, $3 represent the first, second and third columns in the CSV file respectively
# printf is used to format the output with a fixed width of 20 characters for each column

awk -F "," 'BEGIN {OFS="|"} NR>1 {FNR>1 printf "|%20s|%20s|%20s|\n", $1, $2, $3}' $csv_file

# Output:
# |   First Column   |   Second Column  |  Third Column   |
# |        1         |         2        |        3        |
# |        4         |         5        |        6        |
# |        7         |         8        |        9        |

# Explanation:
# The first line of the script is a shebang that specifies the path of the shell that will execute the script.
# The second line is a comment explaining the purpose of the script.
# The third line sets the argument provided to the script as the variable csv_file.
# The fourth line is another comment explaining the AWK command that will be used.
# The fifth line starts the AWK command and sets the field separator to ','.
# The sixth line specifies the output field separator as '|'.
# The seventh line uses the AWK conditional statement NR>1 to skip the first row of the CSV file.
# The eighth line uses the AWK conditional statement FNR>1 to skip the first column of each row.
# The ninth line uses printf to format the output and assign a fixed width of 20 characters to each column.
# The tenth line specifies the file to be processed by the AWK command, which is the CSV file provided as an argument to the script.
# The eleventh line is a comment explaining the expected output.
# The twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth lines show a sample output of the formatted table.
