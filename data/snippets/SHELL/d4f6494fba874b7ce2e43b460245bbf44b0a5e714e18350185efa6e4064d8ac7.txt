#This code snippet is a complex function that performs mathematical operations on an input number
#It takes in an argument called 'n'
function math_operations(n) {   
    #declare a variable 'result' and set it equal to the value of 'n'
    result = n
    #initialize a for loop that iterates from 1 to 10
    for i in {1..10}
    do
        #multiply 'result' by 'i' and store the result in 'result'
        result = $((result * i))
        #add 'i' to 'result' and store the result in 'result'
        result = $((result + i))
    done
    #print the final value of 'result'
    echo "The final result is: $result"
}
#call the function with the input number as 5
