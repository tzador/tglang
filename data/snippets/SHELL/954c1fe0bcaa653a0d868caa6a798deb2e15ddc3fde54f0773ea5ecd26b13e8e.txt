# This is a commented line in shell script
# It starts with a hash (#) character and is used to add comments and explanations 

# Defining variables to store values 
# Variables in shell script do not require explicit declaration 
# They can store any type of value, including strings, integers, and arrays 
# Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, followed by any combination of letters, numbers, or underscores
# Variable names are case-sensitive 

# Store a string in a variable called "greeting"
greeting="Hello, world!"

# Store an integer in a variable called "num"
num=10

# Store an array of strings in a variable called "colors"
colors=("red" "blue" "green")

# Using the echo command to print variables and strings 
echo $greeting                             # Prints the value stored in the "greeting" variable 
echo "The value of num is: "$num            # Concatenates strings and variable value to print a message 
echo "The first color in the array is: "${colors[0]}    # Prints the first element in the "colors" array 

# Using the read command to get user input 
# The user's input will be stored in the "name" variable 
read -p "Enter your name: " name            

# Using conditional statements 
# if-else statement to check if the user's name is "John"
if [ "$name" == "John" ]; then
  echo "Welcome, John!"
else
  echo "Welcome, $name!"
fi

# Using for loop to iterate through an array 
for color in "${colors[@]}"; do
  echo "Color: $color"
done

# Using while loop to print numbers in descending order 
count=5
while [ $count -gt 0 ]; do                   # Loop will continue until the value of "count" is greater than 0
  echo $count
  count=$((count-1))                         # Decrements the value of "count" by 1 in each iteration 
done

# Using function to print a message 
# Function name is "print_message" and it takes one parameter, "msg"
print_message() {
  echo "Message: $1"                         # Prints the value passed as an argument when the function is called 
}

# Calling the "print_message" function 
print_message "This is a custom message"

# Output:
# Hello, world!
# The value of num is: 10
# The first color in the array is: red
# Enter your name: Jane
# Welcome, Jane!
