#This shell script takes two user inputs and multiplies them together
#The result is stored in a variable and printed to the console
#The inputs must be numeric values

#Prompt user to input first number
echo "Enter first number:"

#Read user input and store in a variable
read num1

#Prompt user to input second number
echo "Enter second number:"

#Read user input and store in a variable
read num2

#Use the `expr` command to perform the multiplication operation and store the result in a variable
result=`expr $num1 \* $num2`

#Print the result to the console
echo "The result of multiplying $num1 and $num2 is: $result"
