#! /bin/bash
# This is a shell script that searches for a specific file in a given directory, and counts the number of occurrences of a given word in that file
# Usage: ./search_and_count.sh directory file_name word

# Store the argument values into corresponding variables
directory=$1
file_name=$2
word=$3

# Check if the directory exists
if [[ ! -d $directory ]]; then
    echo "The specified directory does not exist."
    exit 1 # Exit the script if directory does not exist
fi

# Check if the file exists in the given directory
if [[ ! -f $directory/$file_name ]]; then
    echo "The specified file does not exist in the given directory."
    exit 1 # Exit the script if file does not exist
fi

# Using grep command to search for the given word in the file and counting the number of occurrences
count=$(grep -o $word $directory/$file_name | wc -l)

# Output the result
echo "The word '$word' occurs $count times in the file $file_name."

# End of script
