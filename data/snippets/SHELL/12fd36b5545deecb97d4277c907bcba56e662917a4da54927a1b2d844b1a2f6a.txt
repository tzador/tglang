# This is a shell script that takes two command line arguments and performs a calculation
# The first argument is the operation to be performed (addition or subtraction)
# The second argument is the number to be operated on
# Note: This script only works for integer values, decimals will result in an error

# Define variables for operation and number
operation=$1
number=$2

# Check if operation argument is valid
# Valid operations are 'add' and 'sub'
if [ $operation = "add" ]; then
  # Perform addition operation
  # Note: 'expr' is a built-in UNIX command for performing basic arithmetic calculations
  result=$(expr $number + $number)
  # Print result
  echo "The result of adding $number to $number is $result"
elif [ $operation = "sub" ]; then
  # Perform subtraction operation
  result=$(expr $number - $number)
  # Print result
  echo "The result of subtracting $number from $number is $result"
else
  # Print error message if operation argument is invalid
  # Note: '>&2' redirects output to standard error stream
  echo "Invalid operation specified" >&2
