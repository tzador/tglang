# This is a Shell script to calculate the factorial of a number
echo "Enter a number to find its factorial: " # Prompts user for input
read num # Reads user input and stores it in a variable
fact=1 # Initializes a variable to store the factorial value

while [ $num -gt 1 ] # Loop condition to check if number is greater than 1
do
    fact=$((fact * num)) # Calculates the factorial from 1 up to the input number
    num=$((num - 1)) # Decrements the input number for each iteration
done

echo "The factorial of $num is $fact" # Prints the factorial value

# Example input and output:
# Input: 5
# Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
