# This is a code snippet in the SHELL programming language.
# It will create a directory with nested subdirectories,
# move a file into one of the subdirectories,
# and print out the directory tree.
# We will be using the 'mkdir', 'cd', 'touch', 'mv', and 'tree' commands.

# First, we will create a directory named 'program'.
mkdir program

# Next, we will move into the 'program' directory.
cd program

# We will create three subdirectories named 'src', 'includes', and 'bin'.
mkdir src includes bin

# Using the 'touch' command, we will create a file named 'main.cpp' in the 'src' directory.
touch src/main.cpp

# Now, we will move the 'main.cpp' file into the 'bin' directory.
mv src/main.cpp bin/

# Finally, we will print out the directory tree using the 'tree' command.
