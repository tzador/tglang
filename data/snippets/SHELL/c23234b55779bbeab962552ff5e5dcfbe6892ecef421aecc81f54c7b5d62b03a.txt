# This code snippet creates a function that takes in two arguments, a number and a list, and returns the sum of the number and each element in the list
# The function takes advantage of the 'for' loop and 'expr' command in shell scripting
# 'num' represents the number argument and 'list' represents the list argument

sum_function() {               
    for element in "${list[@]}"; do  # loops through each element in the list
        sum="$(expr $num + $element)"  # uses the 'expr' command to calculate the sum of the number and current element
        echo "Sum of $num and $element is: $sum"  # prints the result of the calculation
    done
}

# To call the function, provide a number and a list of numbers separated by spaces
# For example, to find the sum of 5 and the list [1, 2, 3], the function call would be: sum_function 5 1 2 3

# Function call below
sum_function 5 1 2 3
