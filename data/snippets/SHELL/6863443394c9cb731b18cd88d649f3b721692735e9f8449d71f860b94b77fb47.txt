# This is a bash shell script that prints a random quote
# Author: John Doe
# Date: 14/05/2020

# Define an array of quotes
quotes=("Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it." "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." "Believe you can and you're halfway there." "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.")
# Get the length of the array
len=${#quotes[@]}

# Generate a random number between 0 and the array length
index=$(shuf -i 0-${len} -n 1)

# Print the quote at the generated index
echo ${quotes[$index]}
