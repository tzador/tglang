# Define a function named "factorial" that calculates the factorial of a number
factorial() {
    # Assign the value of the first argument to a variable "num"
    num=$1
    # Define a variable "result" and assign the value of 1 to it
    result=1
    # Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to the value of "num"
    for ((i=1;i<=num;i++))
    do
        # Multiply the current value of "result" with the current value of "i"
        ((result *= i))
    done
    # Print the result using the echo command
    echo "The factorial of $num is $result"
}

# Call the function with the argument 5
factorial 5

# Output:
# The factorial of 5 is 120
