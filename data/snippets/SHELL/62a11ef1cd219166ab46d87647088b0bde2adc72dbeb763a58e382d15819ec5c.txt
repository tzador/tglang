# This code snippet uses the 'for' loop in Shell to create a list of even numbers from 0 to 100
# Syntax for loop in Shell: for variable in list; do commands; done

# Initializing a variable 'i' with value 0
i=0

# Starting the for loop, using the 'seq' command to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 100 (inclusive)
for i in $(seq 0 100); do
    # Checking if the number in the current iteration is an even number using the 'expr' command
    # If the remainder when divided by 2 is 0, then the number is even and will be added to the list
    if [ $(expr $i % 2) -eq 0 ]; then
        # Printing the even number with a message
        echo "Even number found: $i"
        # Storing the even number in a list called 'even_list'
        even_list+=( "$i" )
    fi
done

# Printing the list of even numbers
echo "List of even numbers: ${even_list[@]}"

# Output:
# Even number found: 0
# Even number found: 2
# Even number found: 4
# Even number found: 6
# Even number found: 8
# Even number found: 10
# ...
# Even number found: 96
# Even number found: 98
# Even number found: 100

# List of even numbers: 0 2 4 6 8 10 ... 96 98 100
