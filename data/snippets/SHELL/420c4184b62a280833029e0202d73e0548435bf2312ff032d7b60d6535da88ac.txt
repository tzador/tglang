#This script demonstrates the use of a for loop to iterate through a list of numbers

#Declare a variable to store the list of numbers
nums="1 2 3 4 5"

#Use the for loop to iterate through each number in the list
for num in $nums
do
    #Print the current number being iterated
    echo "Number: $num"

    #Check if the number is even or odd and print corresponding message
    if [[ $((num%2)) -eq 0 ]]; then
        echo "This is an even number"
    else
        echo "This is an odd number"
    fi

    #Calculate the square of the number and print it
    square=$(expr $num \* $num)
    echo "Squared: $square"

    #Create a new directory with the number as its name
    mkdir "Number_$num"
