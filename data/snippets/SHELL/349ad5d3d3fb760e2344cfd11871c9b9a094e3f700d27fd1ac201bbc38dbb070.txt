cores=$(grep -c "^processor" /proc/cpuinfo) # counts the number of lines starting with "processor" in the file /proc/cpuinfo and stores the result in the variable "cores"

echo "The name of the CPU is $(cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name" | uniq | cut -d ":" -f 2 | sed 's/^ *//')" # prints the model name of the CPU by finding the line in /proc/cpuinfo that starts with "model name", removing duplicate lines, and extracting the second field after ":" using the "cut" command. The "sed" command removes any leading spaces.

echo "There are $cores cores in this system." # prints the number of cores by using the "cores" variable

# Output:
# The name of the CPU is Intel Core i7-8700K CPU @ 3.70GHz
# There are 6 cores in this system.
