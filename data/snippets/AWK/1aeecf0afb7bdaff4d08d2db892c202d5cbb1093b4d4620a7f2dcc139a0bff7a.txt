{ for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) print $i, "|", NF-i+1; }

The code above loops through each field in a given input and prints the value of the field followed by a pipe symbol (|) and the reverse order number of the field. 
For example, if the input is "John Doe", the output would be:
"John | 2"
"Doe | 1"

This code could be useful for processing data in a delimited format where the order of fields is important. By using the reverse order number, we can easily keep track of which field is being processed, even if the number of fields in the input is unknown.

To use this code, simply input a string with one or more fields, separated by spaces, and it will output the field values and their corresponding reverse order numbers.
