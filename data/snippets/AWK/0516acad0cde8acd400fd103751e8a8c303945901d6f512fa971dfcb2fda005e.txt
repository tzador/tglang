# This AWK code snippet performs a simple text matching task using regular expressions

# Define the regex pattern
BEGIN {
    pattern = "potato|tomato"
}

# For each line in the input, apply the regex pattern and print the matched text
{
    while (match($0, pattern) != 0) {
        # Save the matched text in a variable
        match_text = substr($0, RSTART, RLENGTH)
        # Print the matched text in bold using ANSI escape sequences
        printf "\033[1m%s\033[0m", match_text
        # Update the original string to exclude the matched text
        $0 = substr($0, RSTART+RLENGTH)
    }
    # Print the remaining text
    print
}
