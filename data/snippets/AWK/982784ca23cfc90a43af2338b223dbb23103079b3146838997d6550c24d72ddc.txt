# This code snippet will count the number of words in a text file and print out the count using AWK

# Set the delimiter to be a space or a newline character
BEGIN { FS = "[ \n]"; count = 0 }

# For each word encountered, increment the count variable
{ count++ }

# Print the final count after processing the entire file
END { print "Total number of words:", count }
