# This AWK code snippet takes in a file named "numbers.txt" containing a list of numbers, 
# and outputs the average of the numbers.

# Set FS (field separator) to newline
BEGIN {
  FS = "\n"
}

# Initialize variables
{
  sum += $1 # $1 represents the first number in each line
  count++   # Keeps track of the number of lines in the file
}

# Calculate and print the average
END {
  print "The average of the numbers is: " sum/count
}

# Run the code on the file "numbers.txt"
# To run, enter the command 'awk -f avg.awk numbers.txt' in the terminal 
# where 'avg.awk' is the name of this file.
