## This AWK code snippet reads a file and calculates the average of a column of numbers

## Set the field separator to a space
BEGIN {
    FS = " "
}

## Initialize the sum to 0
{
    sum = 0
}

## For each line, add the number in the specified column to the sum
{
    sum += $3
}

## At the end, calculate the average and print it
END {
    average = sum / NR
    printf("The average of column 3 is: %.2f\n", average)
}
