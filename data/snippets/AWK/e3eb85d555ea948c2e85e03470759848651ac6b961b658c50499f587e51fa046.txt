#!/bin/awk -f
# This is a sample AWK program that reads a file of student records, calculates the average grade, and outputs the results with some formatting.

# Initialize variables for sum and number of records
{
  sum += $3
  numRecords++
}

# Calculate average grade and format output
END{
  average = sum / numRecords
  printf "The average grade is: %.2f\n\n", average
  printf "%-20s %-20s %-10s\n", "Name", "ID", "Grade"
  for (i = 1; i <= numRecords; i++){
    printf "%-20s %-20s %-10s\n", $1, $2, $3
  }
}

# Input file format should be:
# Name, ID, Grade
# John Smith, 123456, 85
# Jane Doe, 654321, 92

# To run this code, save it in a file with a .awk extension and run the following command: awk -f <file_name>.awk <input_file>
