# This code snippet uses AWK to calculate the factorial of a number

BEGIN { # sets up the starting point
  printf("Enter a number: ")
  getline num # takes user input for number
  factorial = 1 # initializes factorial variable
  for (i = 1; i <= num; i++) { # loops through numbers from 1 to num
    factorial *= i # multiplies factorial by current number
  }
  printf("The factorial of %d is %d\n", num, factorial) # prints result
}
