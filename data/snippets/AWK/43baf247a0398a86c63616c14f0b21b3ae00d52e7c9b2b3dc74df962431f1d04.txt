# This AWK code snippet checks for the number of lines in a file

BEGIN { # indicates the start of the program
    count = 0 # declares a variable 'count' to store the number of lines
}

{ # indicates the start of a pattern-action
    count++ # increments count by 1 for each line
}

END { # indicates the end of the program
    print "Total lines: " count # outputs the final count of lines in the file
}

# To execute this code snippet, save it in a file (e.g. count_lines.awk) and run the following command in your terminal:
# awk -f count_lines.awk filename.txt
# make sure to replace 'count_lines.awk' with the actual filename and 'filename.txt' with the name of the file you want to check.
