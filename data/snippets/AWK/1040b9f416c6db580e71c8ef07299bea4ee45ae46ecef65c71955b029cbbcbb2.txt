# The following code snippet uses AWK to filter a csv file based on a certain condition and output the results in a new csv file

# First, set the field separator to be a comma
BEGIN {
    FS = ","
}

# Next, check if the first field (column) is equal to "Male" and the fifth field is larger than 30
$1 == "Male" && $5 > 30 {
    # If the condition is met, print the entire record to the output file
    print $0 >> "male_over_30.csv"
}

# Lastly, close the output file once all records have been processed
END {
    close("male_over_30.csv")
}

# To run this code, use the following command in the terminal:
# awk -f filter.awk input.csv
