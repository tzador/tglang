# This code snippet demonstrates how to use the 'if' statement in AWK

# Defining an input file using the 'BEGIN' block
BEGIN {
    FS = "," # Setting the field separator to comma
    OFS = " " # Setting the output field separator to space
}

# Defining the main 'awk' block
{
    sum = 0 # Initializing a variable to store the sum of numbers
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) { # Looping through all fields in the current record
        if ($i ~ /^[0-9]/) { # Checking if the current field is a number
            sum += $i # Adding the number to the sum variable
        }
    }
    print "The sum is:", sum # Printing the sum of numbers in the current record
}

# Defining the 'END' block
END {
    print "End of file reached." # Printing a message indicating end of file
}
