# This code snippet uses AWK to calculate the sum of numbers in a given file.
# The file should contain one number per line.
# It first creates a variable with value 0 for the total sum.
# Then, it uses a while loop to iterate through each line in the file.
# Inside the loop, it uses the built-in AWK function "sum" to add the number in the current line to the sum variable.
# After the loop is completed, it prints the final sum to the console.

BEGIN{
    total_sum = 0 # initialize total sum variable
}

{
    total_sum = sum(total_sum, $0) # add current number to total sum using built-in function
}

END{
    print "The total sum is: " total_sum # print final sum to console
}
