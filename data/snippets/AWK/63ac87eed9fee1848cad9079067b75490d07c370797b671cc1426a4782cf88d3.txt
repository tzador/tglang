# This code snippet uses AWK programming language to calculate the average of a given set of numbers.

# Initializing variables
BEGIN {
    total = 0    # Total sum of numbers
    count = 0    # Count of numbers
}

# Loop through each line of input
{
    total += $1    # Add number to total
    count++        # Increment count
}

# Calculate and print average
END {
    avg = total/count    # Calculate average
    print "Average is " avg    # Print average
}
