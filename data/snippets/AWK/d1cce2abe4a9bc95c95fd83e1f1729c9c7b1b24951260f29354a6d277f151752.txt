#!/bin/awk -f

# This AWK program takes in a text file and counts the number of words in each line.

# Initialize the line number and word count variable
BEGIN {line_num = 0; word_count = 0;}

# Read each line of the text file
{
    # Split the line into an array of words
    words = split($0, arr, " ");

    # Loop through the array of words
    for (i = 1; i <= words; i++){
        # Check if the current word is not empty
        if (arr[i] != "") {
            # Increment the word count by 1
            word_count++;
        }
    }

    # Print the line number and word count
    print "Line " line_num " has " word_count " words.";

    # Reset the word count for the next line
    word_count = 0;

    # Increment the line number by 1
    line_num++;
}

# End the program
END {}

# Usage: awk -f word_count.awk <text_file>
# Replace <text_file> with the name of the input file.
