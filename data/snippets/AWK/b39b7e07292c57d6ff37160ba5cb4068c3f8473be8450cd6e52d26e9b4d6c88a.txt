#This AWK code snippet creates a function that takes in a sentence as input and returns the longest word in the sentence.
function longest_word(sentence) {
  #Split the sentence into an array of words using space as the delimeter
  split(sentence,words," ")
  
  #Initialize a variable to store the length of the longest word
  longest = 0
  #Initialize a variable to store the longest word
  longest_word = ""
  
  #Loop through each word in the array
  for (i=1; i<=length(words); i++) {
    #Check if the length of the current word is longer than the current longest word
    if (length(words[i]) > longest) {
      #Set the current longest word to the current word
      longest_word = words[i]
      #Update the length of the longest word
      longest = length(words[i])
    }
  }
  
  #Return the longest word
  return longest_word
}

#Create a sentence to test the function
sentence = "This is a test sentence to find the longest word"

#Call the longest_word function with the test sentence as input and store the result in a variable
longest = longest_word(sentence)

#Print the result
print "The longest word in the sentence '" sentence "' is '" longest "'."

#Output:
