# This program uses AWK to process a csv file and calculate the average of a specific column
# Declaring the AWK script with BEGIN, which gets executed before any input is read
BEGIN {
  # Set FS (field separator) to comma since we're dealing with a csv file
  FS = ","
  # Initialize sum variable
  sum = 0
  # Initialize count variable
  count = 0
}

# 'NF' is a built-in variable in AWK, which represents the number of fields in a record
# Here, we are only interested in records with more than 2 fields (to avoid header)
# We use a conditional statement to check for this condition.
# $1 represents the first field, $2 represents the second field and so on
# Here, we are only interested in the second field, hence $2
# '++' is a shorthand for incrementing a variable by 1
NF > 2 {
  # Add the value of second field to sum
  sum += $2
  # Increment count by 1
  count++
}

# END is another built-in AWK keyword, which gets executed after all the input records have been read
END {
  # Calculate average by dividing sum by count
  avg = sum/count
  # Print the average with a message using AWK's 'printf' function
  printf "The average of the second column is %f", avg
