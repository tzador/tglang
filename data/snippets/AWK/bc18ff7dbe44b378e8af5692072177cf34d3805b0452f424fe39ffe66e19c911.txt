# This code snippet uses the AWK programming language to calculate the average of a list of numbers from a file.

BEGIN {
    # Initialize variables
    sum = 0
    count = 0
}

# Read the file line by line
{
    # Add each number to the sum
    sum += $1
    # Keep track of the number of entries
    count++
}

# When the file has been fully read
END {
    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of entries
    avg = sum / count
    # Print the result
    print "The average of the numbers in the file is: " avg
}
