# The following command is used to set the input field separator to a space
BEGIN {
  FS = " "
}
# The following command reads each line of the input file and sets the variable 'num_chars' to the number of characters in the line
{
  num_chars = length($0)
}
# The following command prints the line number, followed by a colon and the number of characters in that line

  print NR ":" num_chars
}

# To run this program, save it as 'character_counter.awk' and run the following command:
# awk -f character_counter.awk <filename>
