# This code snippet uses AWK (Aho–Weinberger–Kernighan) programming language to read a CSV file and calculate the sum of the second column.
# It makes use of arrays, conditional statements and loops.

# Begin block
BEGIN { 
 # Set internal field separator (input record separator) to comma
 FS = ","
 # Declare an array (associative) to store column sums
 # column number as key and sum as value

{
 # Skip header line
 if (FNR == 1)

 # Loop through columns
 for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++)
 {
  # If column is number, add it to corresponding sum
  if ($i ~ /^[0-9]+\.*[0-9]*$/)
  {
   sumArray[i] += $i
  }

# End block
