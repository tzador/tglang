# The following AWK code snippet reads in a file containing a list of names and ages,
# and prints out only the names of individuals over the age of 18.
BEGIN {
    # Set the field separator to a comma
    FS = ","

    # Print the heading
    print "Names:"

    # Loop through each line of the file
    while ((getline line < "names.txt") > 0) {

        # Split the line into an array based on the comma separated values
        split(line, fields, FS)

        # Check if the age is greater than 18
        if (fields[2] > 18) {

            # Print the name
            print fields[1]
        }
    }
}
# The expected output of the code snippet is:
# Names:
# John
# Sarah
# David
