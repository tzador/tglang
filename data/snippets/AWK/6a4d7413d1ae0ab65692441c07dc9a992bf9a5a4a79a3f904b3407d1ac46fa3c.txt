# This AWK program compares two files and outputs the lines that are present in both files
# This code snippet assumes the two files are named 'file1' and 'file2'

# Create arrays to store the lines from each file

# Store lines from file1 in 'lines1' array

# Check if line from file2 is present in 'lines1' array, if yes print the line
$0 in lines1 {
  print $0

# Store lines from file2 in 'lines2' array
FNR==NR {

# Check if line from file1 is present in 'lines2' array, if yes print the line
