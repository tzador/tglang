# The following code snippet uses AWK to read a CSV file and print the sum of values in a certain column.

# Set the input and output field separators to comma
FS = ","; OFS = ","

# Define a function to calculate the sum of values in a column
function calculate_sum(arr, col_num){
  sum = 0
  # Loop through the array containing values from the column
  for (i in arr){
    sum += arr[i][col_num] # Add each value to the sum
  }
  return sum
}

# Main code begins here
BEGIN{
  # Read the CSV file and split each record into an array
  while(getline < "data.csv" > 0){
    split($0, arr) # arr contains each record from the CSV file
    # Calculate the sum of values in the third column
    sum = calculate_sum(arr, 3) 
    # Print the record with the sum of values added as a new column
    print $0, sum 
  }
}

# Run the code with the command: awk -f sum_column.awk data.csv
