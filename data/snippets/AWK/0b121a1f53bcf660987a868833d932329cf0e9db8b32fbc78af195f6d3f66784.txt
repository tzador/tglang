# This code snippet uses AWK to count the number of unique words in a file and outputs a sorted list of words and their frequencies

# Store each word and its frequency in an array
awk '{ count[$1]++ } END { for (word in count) { print word, count[word] } }' input_file |

# Sort the array by frequency (descending)
sort -k2nr |

# Print each word and its frequency in a formatted manner
awk '{ printf "%-20s %d\n", $1, $2 }'
