# This is a simple AWK program that reads a file and prints the average of the numbers in it.

# Initialize the total variable to 0

# Iterate through each line of the file and add the number to the total
{
    total += $1

# End the program after iterating through all lines
END {
    # Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of lines in the file
    average = total / NR
    # Print the average with a message
    print "The average of the numbers in the file is:", average
