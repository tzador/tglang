# `MAIN` block: Processes each line of the input and performs desired actions.
# `END` block: Performs any final actions after processing the input.
# Takes input from a file called `numbers.txt`.
# Prints the sum of even and odd numbers in the `numbers` array.
#  * `FS` variable represents the input field separator which is set to a space.
#  * `NF` variable represents the number of fields in each line. In this case, it is 1.
#  * The `mod` function is used to check if the number is even or odd.

# Sample input:
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
# Output:
