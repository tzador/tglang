# The following code snippet is in AWK and it uses a for loop to iterate through an array and print the values.
# The array is initialized with some values and a check is performed to only print even values.
#
# Input:
# 1 2 3 4 5 6
#
# Output:
# 2 4 6

BEGIN {
  # Initializing the array with values
  arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  
  # Using a for loop to iterate through the array
  for(i=0; i<=length(arr);i++){
  
    # Checking if the value is even
    if(arr[i] % 2 == 0){
    
      # Printing the even value
      print arr[i]
      
    }
  }
}

# Output is in triple backticks for annotated markdown code snippet
