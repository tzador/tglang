# This is a code snippet in AWK used for filtering and manipulating text data
# It calculates the average length of words in a given string

# Define the input string
input_string = "This is a sample string for testing purposes."

# Store the string length in a variable
string_length = length(input_string)

# Use the split function to create an array of words
split(input_string, list, " ")

# Initialize a counter
counter = 0

# Loop through the array of words
for(i=0; i<length(list); i++){

    # Increment the counter with the length of each word
    counter = counter + length(list[i])
}

# Calculate the average by dividing the total length by the number of words
average = counter / length(list)

# Print the result
print "The average length of words in the string is " average
