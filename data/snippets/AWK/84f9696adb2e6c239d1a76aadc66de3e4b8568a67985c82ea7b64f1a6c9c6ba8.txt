# This code snippet will calculate the average of a list of numbers using the AWK programming language.
# First, we define an array to hold the numbers.
BEGIN{
  # Initializing count and sum variables.
  count = 0;
  sum = 0;

  # Creating the array.
  arr[1] = 5;
  arr[2] = 10;
  arr[3] = 15;
  arr[4] = 20;
  arr[5] = 25;

  # Looping through the array to calculate the sum.
  for(i in arr) {
    # Summing up the elements.
    sum += arr[i];

    # Incrementing the count variable.
    count++;
  }

  # Finally, calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the array.
  average = sum/count;

  # Printing the result.
  print "The average of the numbers is: " average;
}
