# This program takes a list of numbers as input
# and calculates the average of all the numbers

# Initialize the variables
num_sum = 0 # total sum of numbers
count = 0 # number of numbers
avg = 0 # average of numbers

# While loop to read input and calculate sum
# $NF refers to the last field in each line
while (getline) {
    num_sum += $NF # add last field to sum
    count++ # increment count
}

# Calculate average by dividing sum by count
avg = num_sum / count

# Print the result in a formatted statement
printf("The average of all %d numbers is %.2f\n", count, avg)
