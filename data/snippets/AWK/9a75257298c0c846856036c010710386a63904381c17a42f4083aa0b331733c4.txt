# This function gets the average of an array of numbers
function getAverage(arr) {
    # Initialize sum variable to 0
    sum = 0;

    # Loop through the array
    for (i = 1; i <= length(arr); i++) {
        # Add current element to sum
        sum += arr[i];
    }

    # Calculate average by dividing sum by number of elements
    average = sum / length(arr);

    # Print average to console

# Example array
numArr = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];

# Call getAverage function with numArr as parameter
getAverage(numArr);

# Output:
# The average is: 17
