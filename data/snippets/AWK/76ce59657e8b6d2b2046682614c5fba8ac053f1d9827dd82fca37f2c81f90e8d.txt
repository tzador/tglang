# This is a complex AWK program that reads in a CSV file and calculates
# the average value of a column by grouping it based on another column.
# The program uses arrays, loops, if statements, and awk built-in functions.

# Set the field separator to comma
BEGIN { FS = "," }

# Read in the CSV file and store the values in arrays
NR == 1 { heading = $0 } # Save the headings as the first line
NR > 1 { data[$1] += $2 } # Add the values in column 2 to the corresponding data array index

# Loop through the data array and calculate the average for each group
END {
  print heading # Print the headings
  for (i in data) { # Loop through each index in the data array
    group_avg[i] = data[i] / (NR - 1) # Calculate the average for each group
    print i "," group_avg[i] # Print the group name and average value
  }
