# This is a program to count the number of words and lines in a given file
# awk is a programming language that is used for text processing
#
# - The BEGIN block initializes the variable 'count' to 0
# - The first rule matches every line in the file and increments the 'count' variable by the number of words in the line
# - The END block prints the value of the 'count' variable as well as the number of lines in the file

BEGIN {
    count = 0 # initialize count variable
}

{
    count += NF # increment count by number of fields(words) in the line
}

END {
    print "Number of words:", count # print the number of words in file
    print "Number of lines:", NR # print the number of lines in file
