# This is a complex AWK code snippet that prints out the top 10 longest lines of a given file

# Define the maximum number of lines to print, change as needed
BEGIN {
    MAX_LINES = 10
}

# Initialize the array to store the longest lines
#

# Process each line of the input file and keep track of the top 10 longest lines
{
    # If the current line is longer than the shortest line in the array, replace it with the current line
    if (length($0) > length(longest_lines[MAX_LINES])) {
        longest_lines[MAX_LINES] = $0
        
        # Re-sort the array to ensure the longest lines are always at the end
        for (i = MAX_LINES - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
            if (length(longest_lines[i]) < length(longest_lines[i + 1])) {
                temp = longest_lines[i]
                longest_lines[i] = longest_lines[i + 1]
                longest_lines[i + 1] = temp
            }

# END block to print out the top 10 longest lines
END {
    # Loop through the array and print out the longest lines
    for (i = 1; i <= MAX_LINES; i++) {
        print i + ": " + longest_lines[i]
    }
}

# To run this code on a file named "input.txt", use the command:
# awk -f longest_lines.awk input.txt

# The output will be similar to:
# 1: This is the first longest line of the input file.
# 2: This is the second longest line of the input file.
# 3: This is a much longer line than the ones before it.
# 4: And this one is even longer than the previous one!
# 5: This line is not as long as the others.
# 6: Another long line that will probably make it into the top 10.
# 7: Sometimes the longest lines are also the most interesting ones.
# 8: But not always, as seen in this example.
# 9: Just two more lines to go.
# 10: The last one, and it happens to be the longest one of all!
