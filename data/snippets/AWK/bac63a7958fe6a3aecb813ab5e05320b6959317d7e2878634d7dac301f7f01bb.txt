# In this code snippet, we will create an AWK program that will calculate the average of a given column in a text file.
# We will input the name of the text file and the column number to calculate the average for as command-line arguments.

# Input the filename and column number as command-line arguments
# ARGV[0] is the name of the AWK program, ARGV[1] is the name of the text file and ARGV[2] is the column number
BEGIN{ 
	FS= "," # Set the field separator to comma
	sum = 0 # Initialize sum variable to 0
	count = 0 # Initialize count variable to 0
}

# For each line in the text file
NR > 1{
	# Add the value of the column to the sum
	sum += $ARGV[2] 
	# Increment the count variable
	count++
}

# Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count
END{
	avg = sum/count 
	# Print the average with a label
	print "Average of column " ARGV[2] " in file " ARGV[1] ": " avg 
}

# Save the output in a file using redirection operator
# Usage: awk -f average.awk filename column_number > output.txt
# Note: Column numbering starts from 1
