## Use BEGIN to initialize variables
BEGIN{
    ## Initialize variable for total sum
    total = 0
}

## Use FS to set the field separator
## In this case, the separator is a comma
## This will split each line of input into separate fields
FS = ","

## Use OFS to set the output field separator
## In this case, the separator is a vertical bar
OFS = "|"

## Use NR to keep track of the current line number
## Iterate through each line of input starting from the second line (NR > 1)
## Each line will be split into fields
## The first field will be the country, the second field will be the population
## Use NF to get the total number of fields in the current line
NR > 1 {
    ## Use a conditional statement to check if the population is greater than 100 million
    if($2 > 100000000){
        ## Use printf to print the country and population separated by the OFS
        printf("%s%s%s%s", $1, OFS, $2, ORS)

        ## Add the population to the total sum
        total += $2
    }
}

## Use END to print the final total sum
END{
    ## Print a divider line
    print "-----------------------"

    ## Use printf to print the total sum separated by the OFS
    printf("TOTAL%s%s%s", OFS, total, ORS)
