# This is a complex AWK code snippet that performs a data transformation
# First, we create an array to store the data we want to transform
{
  data[$1] = $2
}
# Next, we use a for loop to iterate through the array and manipulate the data
END {
  for (key in data) {
    # We use regular expressions to replace certain characters in the data
    gsub(/\//, "-", data[key])
    gsub(/[\(\)]/, "", data[key])
    # Then we split the data based on a delimiter and assign it to a new array
    split(data[key], newData, ",")
    sum = 0
    # We use another for loop to calculate the sum of the data elements
    for (i = 1; i <= length(newData); i++) {
      sum += newData[i]
    }
    # Finally, we print the transformed data
    print key " : " sum
