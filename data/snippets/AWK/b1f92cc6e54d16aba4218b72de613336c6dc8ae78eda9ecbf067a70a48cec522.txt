# Sample input data:
# Name	Age	Sex
# John	30	Male
# Kate	25	Female
# John	35	Male
# Kate	27	Female

# Sample output:
# John 2
# Kate 2

# Explanation: This code snippet uses AWK to count the number of occurrences for each unique value in the first column of input data. It sets the field separator as tab and uses the first column as the key for the count array. The END block sorts the keys in ascending order using asorti() function and then prints the count for each key. Therefore, the output shows the names and the corresponding number of occurrences.
