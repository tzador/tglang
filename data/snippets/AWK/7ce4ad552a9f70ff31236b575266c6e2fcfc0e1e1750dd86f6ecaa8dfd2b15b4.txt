# This code snippet is a program that reads a CSV file and calculates the average of a particular column

# Set the input field separator to a comma
BEGIN { FS = "," }

# Initialize the sum and count variables
{ 
  sum += $2; 
  count ++; 
}

# After processing each line, print the average
END { print "Average is", sum/count; }

# To run this program, use command line: awk -f average.awk input.csv
# Replace "average.awk" with the name of your AWK file and "input.csv" with the name of your CSV file
