# This AWK code snippet prints out all lines that contain a specific word
BEGIN {
# 'BEGIN' is a special block that runs before processing the actual data
    print "Enter the word to search for: "
    getline word < "-"
    # 'getline' reads a line of input from standard input into the variable 'word'
}
{
# this block is executed for each line of input
    if ( $0 ~ word ) # '~' is the "match" operator, returns boolean value
        # '$0' represents the current line of input being read
        print $0 # if matching, print the line
}
