# This AWK program searches for patterns in a file and prints out the corresponding lines.

# Initialize a variable `pattern` with the pattern to search for
pattern = "hello"

# Define the AWK function `match_pattern` that searches for the pattern in each line
function match_pattern(line) {
    # Use the AWK built-in function `match` to check if the line contains the pattern
    # If a match is found, print out the entire line
    if (match(line, pattern)) {
        print line
    }
}

# Set the field separator to a single space
FS = " "

# Begin reading the file
{
    # Call the `match_pattern` function on each line
    match_pattern($0)
