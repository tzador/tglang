# This code snippet demonstrates an AWK program that searches for a specific string in a file and counts its occurrences
BEGIN { # The BEGIN section of AWK runs before input is read from the file
    count = 0 # Initialize a variable to keep track of occurrences
}
{ # The main section of AWK runs for each line of input
    if ($0 ~ "specific string") { # Checks if the line contains the specified string
        count++ # If it does, increment the count
    }
}
END { # The END section of AWK runs after all input has been processed
    print "The specific string occurs", count, "times in the file." # Print the total count of occurrences
}
