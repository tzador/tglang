#!/bin/awk -f

# This AWK script uses a complex regular expression to match patterns in a given text file.

# Define the regular expression to match patterns and assign it to the variable "pattern"
BEGIN {
    pattern = /^[A-Z][a-z]+\s[0-9]+\s[A-Z][a-z]+\s[A-Z][a-z]+/
}

# Apply the regular expression to each line in the input file
# If a match is found, print the line with the matched pattern enclosed in brackets
{   
    if ($0 ~ pattern) {
        print "[" $0 "]"
    }
}

# Run the script by passing in the text file as an argument
# The output will only include the lines that contain the matched pattern
# To save the output as a new text file, use the command "awk -f script.awk input.txt > output.txt"
# Make sure to grant execution permissions to the script using "chmod +x script.awk"
# Example command: "./script.awk input.txt"
