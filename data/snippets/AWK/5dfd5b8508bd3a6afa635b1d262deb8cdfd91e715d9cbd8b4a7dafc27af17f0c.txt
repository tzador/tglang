# Function: sum
# Description: This function takes in an array of numbers
# and calculates the sum of all the numbers in the array.
# Input: An array of numbers
# Output: Sum of all the numbers in the array

BEGIN {

# Declare an array called "numbers"
# Declaring an array in AWK is done using the "@" symbol
# The array will store all the numbers passed in as input parameters
numbers = []

# Set the field separator to a space
# This is used to split the input parameters by using the "split" function
FS = " "

# Read in the input parameters and split them into separate elements in the "numbers" array
# The "split" function takes in three parameters: the input, the output array, and the separator
split($0, numbers, FS)

# Initialize a variable called "sum" to store the sum of all the numbers
sum = 0

# Loop through the "numbers" array using a for loop
for (i in numbers) {

# Add each element in the "numbers" array to the "sum" variable
# The "+=" operator adds the value on the right to the value on the left
sum += numbers[i]
}

# Print the sum of all the numbers
# The "printf" function takes in a format string and a list of arguments
# The "%d" format specifier is used for integers
printf("The sum of the numbers is: %d", sum)
