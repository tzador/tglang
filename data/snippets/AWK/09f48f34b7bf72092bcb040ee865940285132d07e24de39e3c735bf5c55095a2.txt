# This AWK program will find all words in a file that contain a double letter and print them out

# First, set the record separator to be a space character
BEGIN { RS=" " }

# Next, loop through each record (which is now a single word)
{ 
    # Store the previous letter in a variable, initialized to blank for the first record
    prev_letter = ""
    
    # Loop through each character in the record
    for (i = 1; i <= length($0); i++) { 
        # Check if the current letter is the same as the previous letter
        if (substr($0, i, 1) == prev_letter) { 
            # If it is, print the word (using the print statement)
            print $0
            
            # Exit the loop so we don't repeat printing the word
