# This is a complex AWK code snippet that takes in a CSV file as input and performs data manipulation and processing.

# This function reads in the CSV file and splits each line into an array based on the comma delimiter.
BEGIN {
    FS = "," # set field separator to comma
}

# This function checks if the current line has 4 fields and stores the data in variables. It also converts the data to numbers if needed.
NF == 4 {
    id = $1 # store first field as id
    name = $2 # store second field as name
    quantity = ($3 + 0) # convert third field to number and store as quantity
    price = ($4 + 0) # convert fourth field to number and store as price
}

# This function checks if the current line is the first line (header) and prints column titles.
FNR == 1 {
    print "ID\tName\tQuantity\tPrice"
}

# This function calculates the total price for each item by multiplying the quantity and price, and prints the results.
FNR > 1 {
    total = quantity * price # calculate total price
    printf "%d\t%s\t%d\t%.2f\n", id, name, quantity, total # print results with appropriate formatting
}

# To run this code, use the following command in the terminal: `awk -f <filename>.awk <inputfile>.csv`
