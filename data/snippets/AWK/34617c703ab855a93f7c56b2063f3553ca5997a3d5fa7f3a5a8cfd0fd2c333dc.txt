# This is a code snippet in AWK
# It performs a search and replace operation in a given file

# First, we define the search and replace pattern using the "BEGIN" statement
BEGIN {
    # The search pattern is 'kingdom' and the replace pattern is 'queendom'
    search_pattern = "kingdom"
    replace_pattern = "queendom"
}

# Next, we use the "NR" variable to specify which line of the file to search and replace on
# In this case, we will be performing the operation on every line of the file
# The code block is enclosed in curly braces
NR {
    # We use the "gsub" function to search and replace the patterns in the current line
    # The first parameter is the search pattern, the second is the replace pattern, and the third is the line to perform the operation on
    gsub(search_pattern, replace_pattern, $0)
    # The "$0" represents the entire line of the file
    # After performing the operation, the updated line is stored in the "$0" variable
    
    # Finally, we print the updated line to the console
    print $0
}

# To execute this code, we use the "awk" command followed by the name of the file to be processed
# For example: awk -f search_replace.awk input_file.txt
# The output will be the updated file with the search and replace operation performed
