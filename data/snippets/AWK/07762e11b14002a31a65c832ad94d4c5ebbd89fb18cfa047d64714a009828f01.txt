# This code snippet uses AWK to calculate the average of a set of numbers

BEGIN {
    total = 0
    count = 0
}

# Loop through each input number
{
    total += $0 # Add current input number to total
    count++ # Increment count by 1
}

# Print the average
END {
    average = total / count
    print "The average is " average
}

# To run this code, use the command:
# awk -f calculate_average.awk <input_file>

# Input file should contain numbers separated by new lines
# Example: 
# 1
# 2
# 3
# Output: 
# The average is 2
