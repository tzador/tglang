# This code snippet uses the AWK programming language to count the number of occurrences of each word in a given string.

# Define the input string
BEGIN {
  input = "Hello world, how are you? This is a test for the AWK code snippet."
}

# Convert the string to an array with words as indices and their number of occurrences as values
{
  # Remove all punctuation and convert string to lowercase
  gsub(/[^[:alnum:] ]/, "", $input)
  $input = tolower($input)
  
  # Loop through each word in the string
  for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
    # If the word is already in the array, increment its occurrences
    if (word_count[$i]) {
      word_count[$i] += 1
    }
    
    # If the word is not in the array, add it with one occurrence
    else {
      word_count[$i] = 1
    }
  }
}

# Print the results
END {
  # Loop through the array and print each word and its corresponding number of occurrences
  for (word in word_count) {
    print word, ":", word_count[word]
  }
}
