# This program takes in a file of names and grades
# and calculates the average grade for each student.


# Define variables for sum and count
# These will be used to calculate the average grade later on
sum = 0

# Use a while loop to go through each line in the input file
# and split it into name and grade
# The delimiter used is a space character
while (getline line < "input_file.txt" > 0)
{
    split(line, data, " ")

    # Update the sum by adding the current grade
    sum += data[2]

    # Increment the count by 1 to keep track of how many grades have been read
    count++
}

# Close the file
close("input_file.txt")

# Calculate the average grade by dividing the sum by the count
avg_grade = sum / count

# Print the result in the desired format
# The format flag "%s" is used to specify string output
# and "%.2f" specifies that the grade should be formatted with 2 decimal places
printf "%s's average grade is %.2f\n", data[1], avg_grade
}'


# Run the program by passing in the input file as an argument
# and redirecting the output to a new file called "output_file.txt"
# The "-F" flag is used to specify the input field separator as a space character
# The "-f" flag is used to specify the program file to be executed

# Sample input file format:
# John 90
# Jane 85
# Mark 95

# Sample output_file.txt contents:
# John's average grade is 90.00
# Jane's average grade is 85.00
# Mark's average grade is 95.00
