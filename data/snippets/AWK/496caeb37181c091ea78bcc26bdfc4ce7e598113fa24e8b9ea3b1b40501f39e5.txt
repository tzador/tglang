# This code snippet calculates the average of a list of numbers using AWK.

# Assign the list of numbers to variable 'numbers'
{
  numbers = "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
}

# Split the numbers into an array called 'nums' using space as the delimiter
split(numbers, nums, " ")

# Initialize the variable 'sum' to 0 for storing the sum of numbers
sum = 0

# Loop through the array 'nums' and calculate the sum of numbers
for (i = 1; i <= length(nums); i++) {
  sum += nums[i]
}

# Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the array
avg = sum / length(nums)

# Print the average to the console with two decimal places
printf("%.2f", avg)

# Output:
5.50
