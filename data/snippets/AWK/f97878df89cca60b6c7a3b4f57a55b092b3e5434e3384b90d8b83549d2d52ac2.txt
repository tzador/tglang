# This is a complex AWK code snippet that counts the number of words in a given file.

# Sets the file field separator to space
BEGIN { FS = " " }

# Loop through each line in the file
{
  # For each word in the line
  for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) {
    # Increment the word count by 1
    count++
  }
}

# Prints the total number of words in the file
END { print "Total number of words: " count }

# To run this code, type the following in your terminal:
# awk -f code.awk <input_file>
# Replace 'code.awk' with the name of this file and <input_file> with the name of the file you want to count the words in.
