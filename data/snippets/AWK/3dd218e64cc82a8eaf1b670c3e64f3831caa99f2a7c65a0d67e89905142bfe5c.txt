#! /bin/awk -f

# This code snippet demonstrates how to use awk to read and manipulate a CSV file.

# Set the field separator to a comma
BEGIN {
    FS = ","
}

# Loop through each line of the CSV file
{
    # Use the NR variable to keep track of the current line number
    if (NR == 1) {
        # If it's the first line, print the headers in bold
        printf "| **%s** | **%s** | **%s** |\n", $1, $2, $3
    } else {
        # For the rest of the lines, print the data separated by pipes
        printf "| %s | %s | %s |\n", $1, $2, $3
    }
}

# We can also perform calculations on the data
{
    # Multiply the third column by 10
    $3 = $3 * 10
    # Print the modified data
    printf "| %s | %s | %s |\n", $1, $2, $3
}

# End the code with the END keyword
END {
    # Print a line before ending the program
    print "----------------------"
