# This code uses the AWK programming language to sum the values in a CSV file column and print the total.
# The CSV file must have a header row and the target column must be named "values".
# Make sure to set the file path as the "input_file" variable.

BEGIN {
    FS="," # Set the field separator to a comma
    total = 0 # initialize total variable
}

NR == 1 {next} # skip the first row, which contains the column headers

{total += $2} # Add the value in the second column to the total variable

END {
    print "Total sum of values in column 'values': " total # print the total
}

# Command to run the code: awk -f sum_values.awk input_file.csv
