# This AWK script will read in a file and calculate the average of a given column
# This script assumes the file is comma separated and has a header row

# Initialize variables

    total = 0 # Keeps track of sum of desired column values
}

# Read in file line by line

        count++ # Increment row count
        total += $3 # Add value from third column to total sum
    }
}

# Calculate and print average
END {
    average = total / count # Calculate average
    print "The average of the values in the third column is: " average # Output result
}
