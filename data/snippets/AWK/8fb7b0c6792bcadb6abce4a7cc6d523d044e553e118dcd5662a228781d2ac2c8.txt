# This is a code snippet that uses the AWK programming language. 

# The following code uses the BEGIN pattern to initialize variables and perform certain actions before the program starts. 

BEGIN {
    # Initialize variables
    count = 0
    total = 0
    max = 0
}

# The next line of code creates a pattern match to select lines where the first field is "Fruit". 

/Fruit/ {
    # Increment the count variable by 1
    count++

    # Store the third field as a number and add it to the total variable
    total += $3

    # If the third field is larger than the max variable, set it as the new max
    if ($3 > max) {
        max = $3
    }
}

# This pattern match will execute on all lines in the input file. 

{
    # Print out the first and third fields for each line
    print $1, $3
}

# The END pattern will execute after all lines in the input file have been read. 

END {
    # Calculate the average by dividing the total by the count
    avg = total/count

    # Print out the results
    print "Total number of lines with Fruit:", count
    print "Average price of Fruit:", avg
    print "Maximum price of Fruit:", max
}
