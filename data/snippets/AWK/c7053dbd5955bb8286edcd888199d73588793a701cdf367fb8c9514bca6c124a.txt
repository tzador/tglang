# This code snippet counts the number of occurrences of each word in a given input file 

# initialize array to store words and their count
# use FS (field separator) to specify space as the delimiter between words
BEGIN { 
    FS = " "
}

# for each line in the file, iterate through each word 
# increment the count for that word in the array
{
    for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) {
        words[$i]++
    }
}

# at the end, print each word and its count from the array
END {

# to run this code, input the desired file as an argument 
# e.g. awk -f word_count.awk input_file.txt
# output will display the word and its corresponding count
