# This code snippet demonstrates how
# to use AWK to find the average
# of a list of numbers

# Create an awk array to store the numbers
# and an accumulator variable
BEGIN {
    i = 0 # accumulator variable
}

# Read in the numbers from input
{
    # Add each number to the accumulator
    # and increase the counter
    acc += $0 # $0 represents the current number
    i++
}

# Once input is finished, calculate the average
# Print the result and reset the accumulator and counter
END {
    avg = acc / i # calculate the average
    print "The average is: " avg # print result
    acc = 0 # reset accumulator
    i = 0 # reset counter
}

# This code snippet can be run using the following command:
# awk -f average.awk numbers.txt
# where average.awk is the file name and numbers.txt is the input file with numbers
# Alternatively, you can also pipe the input numbers directly to the code:
# echo "5 10 15" | awk -f average.awk
