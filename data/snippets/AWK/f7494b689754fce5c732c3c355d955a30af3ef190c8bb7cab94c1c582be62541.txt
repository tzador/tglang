# This code snippet uses the AWK programming language to parse a comma-separated value (CSV) file and print out specific information from the data

BEGIN { 
	# Sets the input field separator to comma
	FS = ","
	
	# Prints the column headers for the data
	print "Name", "Age", "Gender", "Occupation", "Location"
}

# Executes the following block of code for each line in the CSV file
{
	# Assigns the values from each column to their respective variables
	name = $1
	age = $2
	gender = $3
	occupation = $4
	location = $5
	
	# Prints the data for each individual, separated by tabs
	print name, age, gender, occupation, location
}

# Prints a summary line with the total number of individuals in the data set
END {
	print "Total number of individuals:", NR
}

# To run this code, save it as a .awk file and use the command "awk -f [filename.awk] [input CSV file]" in the command line
