## This program reads a file and prints the unique values in the first column ##

BEGIN {
    FS = ","  # setting the field separator to comma
}
{
    if ($1 && !seen[$1]) { # checking if first column value is not null and has not been seen before
        print $1 # printing the value
        seen[$1] = 1 # marking the value as seen
    }
