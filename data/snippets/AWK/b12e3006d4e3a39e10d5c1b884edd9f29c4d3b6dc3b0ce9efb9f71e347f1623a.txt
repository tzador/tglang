# This AWK code snippet uses a 'for' loop to iterate through a list of numbers
# and checks if each number is divisible by 3, 5, or both. 
# If it is divisible by 3, the code outputs "Fizz", 
# if it is divisible by 5, the code outputs "Buzz", 
# and if it is divisible by both, the code outputs "FizzBuzz".
