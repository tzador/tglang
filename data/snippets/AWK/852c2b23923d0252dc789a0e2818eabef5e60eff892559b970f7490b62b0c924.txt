# This AWK code snippet takes in a file of data and prints out the lines that contain a specific word in a column.

BEGIN {  # AWK requires a BEGIN statement to declare variables and initialization commands

    search_word = "programming"  # declare the word to search for
    search_column = 2  # declare the column number to search in

}

{ # AWK executes the following commands for every line of input

    if ($search_column ~ search_word) # check if the word is in the designated column
        print $0; # if it is, print the entire line

}
