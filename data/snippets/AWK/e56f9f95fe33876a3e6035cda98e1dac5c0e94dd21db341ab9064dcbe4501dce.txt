# Function to check if a number is prime

    # Initializing a variable to keep track of the number of factors

    # Loop through numbers from 1 to the number itself
    for(i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

        if(n % i == 0) {

    # If the number of factors is 2 (1 and itself), it is prime
    if (factors == 2) {

# Calling the function with a number to check if it is prime
isPrime(17)

# Output:
17 is a prime number
