# This is a simple AWK program that takes a text file as input, counts the number of lines, words, and characters in the file, 
# and then prints out a report with a breakdown of each count.

# Splitting the line into words by using the FS (field separator) variable
# AWK defaults to using whitespace as the field separator
# The NF (number of fields) variable holds the number of words in the line
# Incrementing the num_words variable by adding the NF value to it

# This is done by dividing the num_chars count by the num_words count

# The %s in the second argument represents a string, which is used as a label for the average length
# Dividing by 1.0 converts the result to a floating-point number instead of an integer, since AWK by default only works with integers
