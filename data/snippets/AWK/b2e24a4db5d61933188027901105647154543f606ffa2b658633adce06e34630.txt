# This code snippet calculates the average of a list of numbers
# and prints the result to the console

# initialize a variable to store the sum of numbers
sum = 0

# initialize a variable to store the total count of numbers
count = 0

# read input numbers from standard input using a while loop
# and add them to the sum variable
while ( ( getline input < "-" ) > 0 ) {
  # convert input to a number using the unary operator +
  num = +input
  # check if the input is a valid number
  if ( !isNaN(num) ) {
    # add the number to the sum
    sum += num
    # increment count variable
    count++
  }
}

# calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total count
# and assign it to the avg variable
avg = sum / count

# print the result to the console with a user-friendly message
print "The average of the input numbers is " avg "."

# close the standard input file
close("-")
