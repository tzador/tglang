# The following code snippet uses AWK to read a CSV file and extract certain columns.

# Set the field separator to comma.
FS = ","

# Use the built-in 'split' function to split each line of the input file based on the field separator.
# The 'NF' variable is automatically set to the number of fields in the current line.
split($0, fields, FS)

# Use a for loop to iterate through each field in the current line.
for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {

  # Use the 'printf' function to print only the desired fields, separated by a tab.
  # The fields to be extracted are 1, 3, and 5.
  printf("%s\t%s\t%s\n", fields[1], fields[3], fields[5])
