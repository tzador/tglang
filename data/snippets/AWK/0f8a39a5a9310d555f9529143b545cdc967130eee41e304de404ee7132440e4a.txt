# This program takes a file of data and prints certain fields using the AWK programming language.

# Define a variable to store the name of the file
FILENAME = "data.txt"

# Specify the field separators in the file
BEGIN {
  FS = ","
}

# Ignore the first line (header) of the file
NR == 1 {
  next
}

# Create an array to store the field names
# Initialize it with the desired field names
# For this example, we will print the first and third fields
# $1 represents the first field, $3 represents the third field
# OFS specifies the output separator, which in this case is a comma
{
  fields = [$1, $3] -OFS ","
  
  # Loop through the fields array and print the specified fields
  # Using a for loop to easily add more fields if needed
  for (i = 1; i <= length(fields); i++) {
    print fields[i]
  }
}

# Redirect the data to a new file
# Output will be in the specified fields and separated by commas
