# This code snippet takes in a file with multiple lines and counts the number of words in each line.

# Initialize the variable "count"
# This variable will store the running total of words in each line
BEGIN{
	count = 0 
}

# For each line in the file, split the line into individual words and store them in the "word" array
# Use the split function, which takes in the line as the first argument, a delimiter as the second argument, and the array to store the words in as the third argument
# The delimiter used here is a whitespace, which will split the line into words based on spaces
{
	# Use for loop to iterate through the "word" array
	# Increase "count" by 1 for each word in the array
	for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) {
		count++
	}
	
	# Print out the number of words in each line using the "NR" built-in variable, which tracks the current line number
	# The output follows the format: "Line {line_number}: {word_count} words"
	print "Line", NR, ":", count, "words"

	# Reset the "count" variable for the next line
	count = 0 
}

# End the AWK program
END{
	# Print a newline for formatting
