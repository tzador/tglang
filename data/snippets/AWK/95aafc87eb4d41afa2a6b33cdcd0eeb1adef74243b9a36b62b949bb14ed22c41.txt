# This code snippet uses the AWK programming language to 
# print the average of a column of numbers in a given file.

# Setting the field separator to a space
BEGIN {
    FS = " "
}

# Initializing the sum and count variables
{
    sum += $1 # $1 represents the first column of the current line
    count++
}

# Executed at the end of the file
END {
    # Calculating the average by dividing the sum by the count
    average = sum / count 
    # Printing the average along with a label
    print "Average: " average
