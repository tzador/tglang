# This is a code snippet in AWK

# This snippet uses AWK to search a file for a specific pattern and print the matching lines
# It takes in two parameters - the pattern to search for and the input file

BEGIN { # Starting block
    pattern = ARGV[1] # Assign the first parameter as the pattern to search for
    ARGV[1] = "" # Remove the first parameter from the argument array
    for (i = 2; i < ARGC; i++) { # Loop through the remaining arguments (input files)
        fname = ARGV[i] # Assign the current file name
        ARGC--; # Decrement ARGC to remove the current file name from the argument count
        while ((getline < fname) > 0) { # Loop through the file line by line
            if ($0 ~ pattern) { # Check if the line matches the pattern
                print fname ":", $0 # If it does, print the file name and line (with a colon in between)
            }
        }
    }
    exit # Terminate the program after the loop is finished
