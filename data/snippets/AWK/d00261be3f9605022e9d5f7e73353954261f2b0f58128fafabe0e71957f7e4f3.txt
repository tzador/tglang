#This code snippet uses AWK to calculate the average of a set of numbers

BEGIN { #The 'BEGIN' rule is used to initialize variables and perform any setup tasks before processing the input

    sum = 0 #Initialize variable to store the sum of numbers
    count = 0 #Initialize variable to store the number of numbers
    
    #Loop through all input numbers
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) { #The 'NF' built-in variable stores the number of fields in the current record
        sum = sum + $i; #Add current number to sum
        count++; #Increment count
    }
    
    #Calculate average by dividing sum by count
    average = sum / count;
    
    print "The average of the given numbers is:", average; #Print the calculated average
}

#Sample Input: 1 2 3 4 5
#Output: The average of the given numbers is: 3
