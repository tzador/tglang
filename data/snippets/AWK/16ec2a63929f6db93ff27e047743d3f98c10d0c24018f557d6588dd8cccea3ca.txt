# The following awk program counts the frequency of each word in a text file.
# It uses the NR variable to keep track of the number of lines and the NF variable to count the number of fields per line.
# The program reads each line, splits it into individual words, and stores them in an array called "count".
# If the word is already in the array, its corresponding value is updated.
# At the end, the array is printed in alphabetical order with each word and its frequency.
