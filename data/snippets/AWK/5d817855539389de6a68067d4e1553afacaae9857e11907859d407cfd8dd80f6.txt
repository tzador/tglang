# This AWK program counts the number of occurrences of each word in a text file
#
# The file "words.txt" contains the following text:
#
# Mary had a little lamb,
# Little lamb, little lamb,
# Mary had a little lamb,
# Its fleece was white as snow.
#
# The output will be:
#
# Mary 2
# had 2
# a 1
# little 3
# lamb 3
# Its 1
# fleece 1
# was 1
# white 1
# as 1
# snow 1

# AWK code snippet:

##!/bin/awk -f

# Initialize array to store words and their frequencies
BEGIN {
    for (i = 0; i < 128; i++) {
        words[i] = 0; 
    }
}

# Read in each line of the input file
{
    line = $0;
    # Convert all words to lowercase for accurate counting
    gsub(/[^a-zA-Z ]/, "", line);
    split(tolower(line), arr, " ");

    # Loop through each word and increment its frequency
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        words[arr[i]]++;
    }
}

# Print out the words and their frequencies
END {
    for (word in words) {
        print word, words[word];
    }
}

# Run the program using the words.txt file
# Output will be printed to the console
# `awk -f words.awk words.txt`
