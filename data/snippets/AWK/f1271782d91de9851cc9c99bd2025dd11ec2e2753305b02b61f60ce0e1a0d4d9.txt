#This is a script using the AWK programming language to calculate the average of numbers in a file.

#Use the FS (field separator) built-in variable to set the delimiter as a space between numbers
#Use the NR (number of records) built-in variable to iterate through each line in the file
#Set the condition to only perform actions on lines that have numbers 
#The 'print' function in AWK is used to print to the standard output 
#The 'printf' function is used to format the output with 2 decimal places
#The 'sprintf' function is used to store the formatted output in a string variable
#The 'getline' function is used to read the next line in the file
#The 'close' function closes the current file
#The 'END' built-in pattern is used to perform the following actions after all lines have been read
