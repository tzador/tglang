#This code snippet is a simple implementation of a string matching algorithm in AWK
#It takes a file as input and searches for a given string, displaying the line number and string if found
BEGIN {
    #the string to be searched for
    search_string = "hello"
}

{
    #loop through each line in the file
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        #check if the current line contains the search string
        if (match($i, search_string)) {
            #if found, print the line number and string
            print "Line " NR ": " $i
        }
    }
}

#To run this code, specify the input file as an argument
#Example command: awk -f string_match.awk input_file.txt
#Input file should be in the same directory as the code file

#This code has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of lines in the input file
