# This code snippet uses the AWK programming language to find and print the longest word in a given string.

# Input string
input_string = "This string contains multiple words"

# Splitting the string into an array of words delimited by a space
split(input_string, words, " ")

# Initializing a variable to keep track of the longest word
longest_word = ""

# Looping through the array of words
for (i = 1; i <= length(words); i++) {
  # Checking if the current word is longer than the current longest word
  if (length(words[i]) > length(longest_word)) {
    # Assigning the current word as the longest word
    longest_word = words[i]
  }
}

# Printing the longest word along with its length
print "Longest word: " longest_word ", Length: " length(longest_word)
