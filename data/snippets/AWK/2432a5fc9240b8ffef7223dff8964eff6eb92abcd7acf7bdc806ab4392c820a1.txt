# This code snippet uses AWK programming language
# It checks for duplicate entries in a file and removes them

# Set initial variables
BEGIN {
  prev = ""
  i = 0
  flag = 0
}

# Check for duplicate entries
{
  # Check if current entry is same as previous
  if ($0 == prev) {
    # Set flag to indicate duplicate entry found
    flag = 1
  } else {
    # If entry is different, print it
    print prev
    # Update previous entry to current
    prev = $0
  }
}

# Check if last entry was a duplicate
END {
  # If flag is not set, print last entry
  if (flag == 0) {
    print prev
  }
}

# Example input:
# apple
# banana
