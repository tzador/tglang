# This AWK code snippet uses regular expressions to search for lines with matching patterns and print specific columns from those lines
# Declare regular expression variable to search for lines starting with a number and containing 'apple'
BEGIN {
    pattern = /^[0-9].*apple/
}

# For each line, use regex to match and extract the columns we want to print
# AWK split function is used to extract columns from the line based on delimiter
{
    if (match($0,pattern)) { # If line matches our pattern
        split($0, columns, "\t") # Split the line by tab delimiter into columns
        print columns[1], columns[2], columns[3] # Print the first three columns
