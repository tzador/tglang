# This code snippet is an example of using AWK to extract specific data from a CSV file.
# The CSV file contains data about different books, including the title, author, and price.
# The code checks for books with a price above $50 and prints out the title and author.

BEGIN {
    # Set the field separator to a comma, since it is a CSV file
    FS = "," 
}

NR > 1 {
    # Ignore the first line (header) of the CSV file 
    if ($3 > 50) {
        # If the price is above $50, print the title and author in a formatted string 
        printf "Title: %s, Author: %s\n", $1, $2
    }
}

END {
    # End of program 
    print "Finished extracting data."
}
