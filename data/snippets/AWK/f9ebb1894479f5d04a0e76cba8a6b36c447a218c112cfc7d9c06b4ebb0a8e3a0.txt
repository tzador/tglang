# This code snippet uses AWK to print out a list of unique CPU temperatures from a log file.
# Setting the field separator to ':' to split each line by colon.
# Initializing an array to store the unique values.
# Using a for loop to iterate through each line in the log file.
# Using the NF variable to get the number of fields in each line.
# Storing the third field (CPU temperature) in a variable.
# Checking if the temperature already exists in the array.
# If not, add it to the array.
# Finally, looping through the array and printing out the unique temperatures.
