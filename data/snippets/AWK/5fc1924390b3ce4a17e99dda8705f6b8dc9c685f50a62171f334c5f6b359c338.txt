# This code snippet uses AWK to find the average of column 3 from a csv file and print it out to the console

BEGIN { # starts the program
    FS=","; # sets the field separator to comma for csv file
    total = 0; # initializes total variable to 0
}

{ # for each line in the csv file
    total += $3; # adds the value from column 3 to total
    count++; # increments count variable for each line (to later calculate average)
}

END { # after all lines have been processed
    average = total / count; # calculates average
    print "The average of column 3 is " average; # prints out the average to the console
}

# To run this code, use the command 'awk -f average.awk file.csv' in the terminal, replacing 'average.awk' with the name of the file containing this code and 'file.csv' with the name of the csv file you want to process.
# The output will be the average of column 3 printed to the console.
