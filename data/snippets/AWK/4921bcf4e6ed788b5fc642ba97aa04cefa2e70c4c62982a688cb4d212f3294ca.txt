## Code to count number of occurrences of a specific word in a given string

BEGIN {
    # initialize count variable to 0
    count = 0
    # set the word to be counted
    word = "hello"
    # set the string to be searched
    string = "hello, how are you doing today? hello there, it's a lovely day."

    # split the string into an array based on spaces
    split(string, arr, " ")

    # loop through the array and check for the word
    for (i in arr) {
        # if word is found, increase count by 1
        if (arr[i] == word) {
            count++
        }
    }

    # print the count of word occurrences
    print "The word '" word "' appears " count " times in the string."
