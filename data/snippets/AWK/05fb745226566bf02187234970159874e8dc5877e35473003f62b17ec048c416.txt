# This code snippet uses AWK to process a file containing employee data 
# and print out employee IDs and their corresponding salaries in descending order

# Set the field separator to comma
BEGIN {
    FS = ","
}

# Create an array to store employee IDs and salaries
{
    emp_ids[$1] = $2
}

# Print out the array in descending order using the employee IDs as keys
END {
    for (emp_id in arr) {
        # Use reverse-indexing to print the keys in descending order
        # and use the format function to format the output as desired
        printf "%s: $%.2f\n", emp_id, emp_ids[emp_id]
    }
} 

# To run this code on a file called employee_data.csv, use the following command:
# awk -f employee.awk employee_data.csv
