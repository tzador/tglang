# This program uses AWK to calculate the average of a set of numbers

# Initialize variables
BEGIN{
    # Define array to hold values
    total = 0 # Variable to hold total sum 
    count = 0 # Variable to hold number of input values
    average = 0 # Variable to hold calculated average
}

# Loop through input values
{
    # Add input value to total sum
    total += $1
    # Increment count by 1 for each input value
    count++
}
# Calculate average by dividing total sum by count
average = total/count
# Print out average value
END{
    print "The average of the input values is " average
}

# Sample input values: 10, 15, 20
# Output: The average of the input values is 15
