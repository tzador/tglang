#!/bin/awk -f
# Author: John Smith
# Description: This AWK program takes in a csv file and
# calculates the mean, median, and mode of a given column.
# Usage: awk -f stats.awk input.csv

BEGIN{
  FS = "," # Set field separator
  column = 2 # Set column to calculate stats for
  sum = 0 # Initialize sum variable
  count = 0 # Initialize count variable
  # Declare arrays for mode calculation
  m_array = [] # Stores unique values
  m_count = [] # Stores count for each unique value
}

# For each row in csv file
{
  # Calculate sum
  sum += $column
  # Add value to m_array if not already present
  if (!($column in m_array)){
    m_array[$column] = 0
  }
  # Increment count for each value
  m_array[$column]++
  # Increment total number of values
  count++
}

# Calculate mean
mean = sum / count
print "Mean: " mean

# Calculate median
# Sort m_array in ascending order
asort(m_array)
# Find middle index
mid = int(count / 2)
# If count is even
if (count % 2 == 0){
  # Find middle two values and calculate their average
  median = (m_array[mid] + m_array[mid+1]) / 2
}
else{
  # Otherwise median is the middle value
  median = m_array[mid]
}

# Calculate mode

# For each unique value in m_count
