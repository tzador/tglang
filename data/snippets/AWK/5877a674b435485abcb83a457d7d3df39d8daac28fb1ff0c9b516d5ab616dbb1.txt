# This AWK program implements a basic calculator
# It takes in two numbers and performs various arithmetic operations on them

# BEGIN block to initialize variables
BEGIN {
  # Initializing the variables to 0
  num1 = 0
  num2 = 0

  # Initializing the operations to be performed on the numbers
  add = num1 + num2
  subtract = num1 - num2
  multiply = num1 * num2
  divide = num1 / num2
  remainder = num1 % num2

  # Prompting the user to enter two numbers
  print "Enter a number: "
  # Reading in the first number and storing it in the variable num1
  getline num1 < "-"
  # Prompting the user to enter another number
  print "Enter another number: "
  # Reading in the second number and storing it in the variable num2
  getline num2 < "-"

  # Printing the results of the operations
  printf "The sum of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, add
  printf "The difference between %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, subtract
  printf "The product of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, multiply
  printf "The quotient of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, divide
  printf "The remainder of %d divided by %d is %d\n", num1, num2, remainder
