# A simple AWK program for finding the average of a list of numbers
# This program takes in a file containing a list of numbers, separated by spaces or newlines, and calculates the average

BEGIN {
    # initialize variables
    sum = 0
    count = 0
}

# main loop, read in each line of the input file
{
    # check if line is empty
    if (length($0) == 0) {
        next # skip to next line if empty
    }

    # loop through each number in the line
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        # add number to sum
        sum += $i
        count++ # increment count
    }
}

END {
    # calculate average
    avg = sum / count

    # print result to standard output
    print "The average of the numbers is: " avg
}

# Sample input:
# 5 15 3
# 10
# 2 8

# Output:
# The average of the numbers is: 6
