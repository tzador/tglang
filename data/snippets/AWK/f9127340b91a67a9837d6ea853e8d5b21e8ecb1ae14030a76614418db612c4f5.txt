# This code reads a .csv file and calculates the average of the selected column.
# Input file is specified through command line argument. 

# Define variables
BEGIN {
    FS = "," # set field separator as comma
    total = 0 # initialize total sum
}

# Read each row and add the value in specified column to total
{
    total += $2 # adding value in column 2 to total sum
}

# After all rows are read, calculate the average
END {
    average = total / NR # divide total by number of rows (NR is built-in AWK variable)
    printf "The average of column 2 is %.2f", average # print average with two decimal places
}

# Specify the input file through command line, for example: awk -f code.awk input.csv
# Output: The average of column 2 is 35.07
