# This AWK code snippet calculates the average of a given column in a csv file
# Usage: awk -f average.awk data.csv

# Declare variables to store sum and count
BEGIN {
    sum=0
    count=0
}

# Skip the first line (header) of the csv file
NR == 1 {
    next
}

# Add the value of the column to the sum and increment the count
{
    sum += $1
    count++
}

# Print the average after reaching the end of the csv file
END {
    average = sum / count
