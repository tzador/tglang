# The following code uses the AWK programming language to print the content of a file,
# with annotations in the markdown syntax for clarity.

# Set the field separator to a comma (",")
FS = ","

# Read the input file and loop through each line
# NR represents the current line number
# $0 represents the current line value
# We scan each line for each field separated by the comma,
# and print out the field number and its corresponding value
