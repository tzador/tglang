# The following code snippet is an example of an AWK program 
# that reads a text file and counts the number of words in each line. 

# First, we define the variable "total" to store the total number of words 
# in the entire file. 
total = 0 

# Next, we use the built-in function "split" to separate each line into an array. 
# The array is named "words" and we use the space character as the delimiter. 
# We also use the built-in variable "NF" to get the number of words in the line. 
# Then, we increment the "total" variable by the number of words in the current line. 
{
  split($0, words, " ")
  total += NF
}

# Finally, we use the built-in function "printf" to print out the line number 
# and the number of words in that line. 
# We use "NR" to get the current line number. 
{
  printf("Line %d has %d words.\n", NR, NF)
}

# To run this program, we use the command:
# awk -f word_count.awk text_file.txt

# The above command will execute the AWK program and pass the text file 
# as input, and the output will be displayed in the console.
