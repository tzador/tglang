# This code snippet uses the AWK programming language to check a file for duplicate lines and output count of each duplicate.

# Check if file name is provided as argument
FILENAME = ARGV[1]

if (!FILENAME) {
	print "Please provide file name as argument."
	exit
}

# Variable to store lines
lines = {}

# Read the file line by line
while ((getline < FILENAME ) > 0) {
	lines[$0]++
}

# Close the file
close(FILENAME)

# Output the duplicate lines and their counts
for (line in lines) {
	if (lines[line] > 1) {
		print line ": " lines[line] " duplicates found."
	}
