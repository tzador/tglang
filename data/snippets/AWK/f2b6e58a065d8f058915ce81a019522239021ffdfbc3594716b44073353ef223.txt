# This code snippet takes a CSV file as input and outputs the sum of the second column
# Create a new AWK function to calculate the sum
BEGIN {
    # initialize the variable for sum

# This tells AWK that each column in the file is separated by a comma
# This will make the second column (field) accessible as $2

# NR is a built-in variable that represents the current record number (row)

# To run this code, use the following command in the terminal
# awk -f mycode.awk myfile.csv
# Where mycode.awk is the name of the file containing this code snippet
# And myfile.csv is the name of the CSV file you want to process
