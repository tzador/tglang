##
# This is a code snippet in the AWK programming language that reads a CSV file and outputs a table with the average salary per department.
# Input: CSV file with columns "name", "department", "salary"
# Output: Table with two columns - "department" and "avg salary"
##

# Initialize variables
BEGIN {
    FS = ","                     # Set the field separator to comma
    OFS = "\t"                   # Set the output field separator to tab
    print "Department", "Avg Salary"   # Print header for the table
}

# Create a new array to store the data for each department
{
    departments[$2 " "] += $3    # Add the salary to the total for that department
    counts[$2 " "]++            # Increment the count for that department
}

# After all lines have been processed, loop through the array and calculate the average for each department
END {
    for (department in departments) {
        avg = departments[department] / counts[department]    # Calculate the average salary
        print department, avg            # Output the department and average salary as a row in the table
