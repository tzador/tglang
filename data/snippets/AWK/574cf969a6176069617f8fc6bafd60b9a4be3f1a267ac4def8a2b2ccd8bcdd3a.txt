## Sample AWK code to calculate and print the average of a set of numbers
BEGIN {
    # Initialize variables
    total = 0
    count = 0
    
    # Set input field separator to a comma
    FS = ","
}

{
    # Loop through each field in the current line
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        # Add current field to total
        total += $i
        # Increment count
        count++
    }
}

END {
    # Calculate average by dividing total by count
    avg = total / count
    # Print average to console
    print "The average of the given numbers is " avg
}
