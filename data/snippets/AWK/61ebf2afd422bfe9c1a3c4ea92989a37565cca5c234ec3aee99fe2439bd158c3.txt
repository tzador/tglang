# This AWK code snippet is a program that reads in a CSV file and outputs the sum of values in a specific column.
  
BEGIN {
    FS = "," 	# Set the field separator as a comma
    SUM = 0 	# Initialize the sum variable
}

{
    # Loop through each line in the file
    # and add the value in column 3 to the sum variable
    SUM += $3
}

# After reading the entire file, print the sum
END {
    print "The total sum of values in column 3 is: ", SUM
}

# Run the code by passing in the CSV file as an argument
# awk -f sum_column.awk data.csv
