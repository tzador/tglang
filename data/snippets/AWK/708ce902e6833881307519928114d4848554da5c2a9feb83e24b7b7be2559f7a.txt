# This program takes in a file of student names and their test scores, and outputs their average grade

}

    average = total / (NF - 1) # Subtract 1 to exclude the name field from the count

# Example input:
# Name, Test 1, Test 2, Test 3, Test 4
# John, 75, 80, 90, 85
# Jane, 85, 90, 95, 90

# Output:
# Name     Average Grade
# John     82.50
# Jane     90.00
