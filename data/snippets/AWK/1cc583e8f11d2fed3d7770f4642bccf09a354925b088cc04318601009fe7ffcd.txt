# This AWK program reads in lines of text from standard input, counts the number of words on each line, and outputs the number of words with each line, followed by the line number

{ #start of the main block
    words = 0; # initialize a variable to keep track of number of words in a line
    for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) # loop through each field (word) in the line
        words++; # increment the word count
        
    print "Words: ", words, "\tLine number: ", NR "\n"; # print the number of words and line number for the current line
}

# to run the code, use the command:
# awk -f code.awk input.txt
# where code.awk is the name of the file containing the code and input.txt is the input file 
# that contains the lines of text to be processed
