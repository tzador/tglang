# This code snippet generates a CSV file from a text file using the AWK programming language

# declare variables
BEGIN {
    FS = "\t" # sets the field separator to tab
    OFS = "," # sets the output field separator to comma
    print "Name, Age, Occupation" # prints header row in CSV format
}

# loop through each line of text
{
    print $1, $2, $3 # prints each field separated by the OFS
}

# end file
END {
    print "Generated CSV file" # prints confirmation message
