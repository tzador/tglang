# This AWK code snippet uses a for loop to iterate over a given array and print out the elements in reverse order

# Initializing the array
BEGIN {
    arr[1] = "hello"
    arr[2] = "world"
    arr[3] = "this"
    arr[4] = "is"
    arr[5] = "a"
    arr[6] = "long"
    arr[7] = "and"
    arr[8] = "complex"
    arr[9] = "array"
}

# Setting variable to the length of the array
length = 9

# Looping through the array in reverse order
for (i = length; i > 0; i--) {
    # Printing out the element at index i
    print arr[i]
}
