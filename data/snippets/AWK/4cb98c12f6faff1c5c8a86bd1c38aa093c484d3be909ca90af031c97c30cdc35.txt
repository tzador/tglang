# This code snippet takes in a file containing a list of DNA sequences and
# prints the reverse complement of each sequence

# First, we create an array to map each nucleotide to its complement
BEGIN {
    map["A"] = "T"
    map["T"] = "A"
    map["C"] = "G"
    map["G"] = "C"
}

# Then, we define our function to calculate the reverse complement of a sequence
function reverse_complement(seq) {
    # Initialize an empty string to store the reverse complement
    rev_comp = ""

    # Loop through each character in the sequence, starting from the end
    for (i = length(seq); i >= 1; i--) {
        # Grab the current character
        curr_char = substr(seq, i, 1)

        # Use our array to map it to its complement and add it to the reverse complement string
        rev_comp = rev_comp map[curr_char]
    }

    # Return the reverse complement
    return rev_comp
}

# Lastly, we go through our input file line by line, calculate the reverse complement
# using our function, and print it out
{
    # Remove any leading or trailing whitespace
    gsub("^ *", "")
    gsub(" *$", "")

    # Calculate the reverse complement and print it out with a leading "> "
    print "> " reverse_complement($0)
