# This is a comment in AWK, used to explain what the code is doing

# This code snippet uses a for loop to iterate through each line in a file
# The file name to be read is passed as an argument in the command line when running the AWK script
BEGIN {
    # This is the beginning of the script, before any lines are read
    # The FILENAME variable stores the name of the file passed in as an argument
    print "Reading file:", FILENAME
    # Initialize an empty array to store the count of words for each line
    words_count[FILENAME]
}

# For each line in the file, split the line into words using the default field separator (whitespace)
{
    # Store the number of words in the line into a variable called num_words
    num_words = NF
    # Add the number of words to the corresponding index in the words_count array
    words_count[FILENAME] += num_words
}

# This is the end of the script, after all lines in the file have been read
END {
    # Print out the results for each file
    for (filename in words_count) {
        # Calculate the average number of words per line by dividing the total words by the number of lines (NR)
        avg_words_per_line = words_count[filename] / NR
        # Format the results and print them out
        printf "%s: %d lines, %d words in total, %d average words per line \n", filename, NR, words_count[filename], avg_words_per_line
    }
