"Create two instances of the Point class"
point1 := Point new.
point2 := Point new.

"Set the x and y coordinates of the first point"
point1 setX: 3.

"Set the x and y coordinates of the second point"
point2 setX: 8.
point2 setY: 10.

"Calculate the distance between the two points"
distance := point1 distanceTo: point2.
