The code snippet below is a small program written in SMALLTALK that calculates the factorial of a given number.

| n fact |
n := 5. // initialize n to 5
fact := 1. // initialize the result to 1
n timesRepeat: [ :i | fact := fact * i ]. // loop from 1 to n and multiply the result
^fact // return the factorial value, which is 120
