This is a complex code snippet in SMALLTALK that shows a class definition and usage of inheritance and polymorphism.

First, we define a base class `Animal` which has two properties `name` and `age`. Then, we define two subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` which inherit from `Animal`.

Next, we add a method `makeSound` to the `Animal` class which prints the name and age of the animal. We also override this method in the `Dog` and `Cat` classes to make specific sounds for each animal.

Finally, we create instances of `Dog` and `Cat` and call the `makeSound` method, which will output their respective sounds based on their class definition.
