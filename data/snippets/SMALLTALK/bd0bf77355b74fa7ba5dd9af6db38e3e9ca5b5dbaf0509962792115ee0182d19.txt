1 + 2 / 3To understand this code, we first need to know that '/' is the division operator in SMALLTALK, '1 + 2' is an operation that adds the numbers 1 and 2 together, and '3' is a number. Therefore, this code performs the operation of adding 1 and 2, and then dividing the result by 3. The expected output would be 1, as SMALLTALK performs integer division and discards any remainder.
