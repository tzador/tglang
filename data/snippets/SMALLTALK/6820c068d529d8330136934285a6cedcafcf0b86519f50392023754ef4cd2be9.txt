"Create a class named 'Rectangle' with instance variables 'length' and 'width'"

'Object subclass: #Rectangle
instanceVariableNames: 	'length width'.

"Add a constructor method to initialize the instance variables"

Rectangle >> initialize
	super initialize.
	length := 0.
	width := 0.

"Add a method to calculate the area of the rectangle"

Rectangle >> calculateArea
	^ length * width.

"Add a method to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle"

Rectangle >> calculatePerimeter 
    ^ (length + width) * 2.

"Create an instance of Rectangle and set its length and width"

rectangle := Rectangle new.
rectangle length: 5.
rectangle width: 7.

"Call the calculateArea and calculatePerimeter methods and store the results in variables"

area := rectangle calculateArea.
perimeter := rectangle calculatePerimeter.

"Print out the results using formatted strings"

Transcript show: 'Area: ', area printString, '. Perimeter: ', perimeter printString.
