"This code snippet uses the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of a given number. It first creates an array with the size of the number, and then loops through all numbers from 2 to that number. If at any point, the number is divisible by the current iteration, it is added to the array as a prime factor. The number is then divided by the prime factor and the loop repeats until all prime factors have been found. The resulting array will contain all prime factors in ascending order."
