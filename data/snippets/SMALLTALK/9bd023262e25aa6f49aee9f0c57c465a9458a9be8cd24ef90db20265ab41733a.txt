"This is a code snippet in SMALLTALK that uses multiple methods to calculate the average of a list of numbers and outputs it"

| numbers sum average | "defines a temporary variable named numbers, as well as sum and average variables"

numbers := #(2 3 5 8 10). "sets the list of numbers to be used for calculation"

sum := numbers inject: 0 into: [ :total :current | total + current ]. "uses the inject method to add all the numbers in the list"

average := sum / numbers size. "calculates the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list"

^average. "outputs the average as the result of the code snippet"
