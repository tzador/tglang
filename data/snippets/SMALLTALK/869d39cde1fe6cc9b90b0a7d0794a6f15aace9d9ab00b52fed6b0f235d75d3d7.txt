"Defines a new class called 'Person' with two instance variables: name and age"

--> creating instances

myself := Person new.
myself name: 'John'.
myself age: 29.

yourself := Person new.
yourself name: 'Jane'.
yourself age: 32.

"Creates two instances of the 'Person' class and assigns values to their name and age instance variables"

--> accessing instance variables

myself name. "returns 'John'"
yourself age. "returns 32"

"Accesses the values of the name and age instance variables for the respective instances"

--> manipulating instances

yourself age: 33. "changes the value of the age instance variable for the 'yourself' instance to 33"

--> defining methods

Person>>greet
    Transcript show: 'Hello, my name is ', name, '. Nice to meet you!'.

"Defines a method called 'greet' for the 'Person' class that prints a greeting message to the Transcript based on the instance's name value"

--> calling methods

myself greet. "calls the 'greet' method on the 'myself' instance, which will print 'Hello, my name is John. Nice to meet you!' to the Transcript"

Person>>increaseCount
    totalCount := totalCount + 1.

"Defines a method called 'increaseCount' for the 'Person' class that increments the value of the totalCount class variable by 1"

--> using class variables

Person initialize. "sets the totalCount value to 0"

myself := Person new.
myself increaseCount. "increments the totalCount value by 1"
totalCount. "returns 1 as the value of the totalCount class variable"
