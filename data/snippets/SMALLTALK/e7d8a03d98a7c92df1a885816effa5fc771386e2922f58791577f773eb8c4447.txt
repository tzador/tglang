"This code creates a dictionary called 'animals' and adds several key-value pairs to it. The keys are symbols representing different types of animals and the corresponding values are the sounds they make. Then, using the 'do:' message, it iterates through each key in the dictionary and prints out a statement through the Transcript object showing what sound each animal makes. Each statement is separated by a semicolon for readability."
