Class ExampleClass [

  | instanceVariable | "A vertical bar indicates the declaration of an instance variable"

  "Instance variables can be accessed using getters and setters"

    ^ instanceVariable "The caret symbol is used for returning the value of the variable"
  ]

  exampleSetter: newValue [
    instanceVariable := newValue "An assignment operator is used to set the value of the variable"
  ]

  "Methods can also be defined within the class"
  exampleMethod: arg1 arg2 [ "Method parameters are specified within the parentheses"
    | localVariable | "Local variables are declared using vertical bars, just like instance variables"
    
    localVariable := arg1 + arg2. "Variables can be manipulated and assigned within a method"
