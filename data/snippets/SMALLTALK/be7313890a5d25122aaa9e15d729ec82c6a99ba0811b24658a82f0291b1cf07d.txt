// Creates an array with a size of 100 and assigns it to the variable 'primes'.
// Loops from 2 to 100, assigning each value to the variable 'i'.
// Selects the values from 2 to 'i' and checks if they are prime numbers.
// If the number of prime numbers is equal to 1, then it is added to the 'primes' array.
// Returns the 'primes' array with all prime numbers.
