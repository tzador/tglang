"Define a method named 'factorial' that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion"

factorial: n
	"Calculates the factorial of n using recursion"
	
	n = 0 ifTrue: [^ 1]. "Base case: factorial of 0 is 1"
	n < 0 ifTrue: [^ 'Invalid input']. "Negative numbers have no factorial"

	^ n * self factorial: n - 1. "Recursive call to calculate n-1 factorial and multiply by n"
