"Example code snippet in smalltalk"

"Define the class Point with two instance variables"
Object subclass: #Point
	instanceVariableNames: 'x y'

"Define the method 'initialize' to set the values of x and y"
Point>>initialize
	super initialize.
	x := 0.
	y := 0.

"Define the method 'getX' to get the value of x"
Point>>getX
	^x

"Define the method 'getY' to get the value of y"
Point>>getY
	^y

"Define the method 'setX:' to set the value of x"
Point>>setX: aNumber
	x := aNumber

"Define the method 'setY:' to set the value of y"
Point>>setY: aNumber
	y := aNumber

"Create an instance of Point called 'origin' and set its x and y values"
origin := Point new.
origin setX: 0.
origin setY: 0.

"Create an instance of Point called 'point1' and set its x and y values"
point1 := Point new.
point1 setX: 5.
point1 setY: 10.

"Calculate the distance between the two points using x and y values"
distance := (point1 getX - origin getX) + (point1 getY - origin getY).

"Print the result of the calculation"
Transcript show: 'The distance between origin and point1 is: ', distance printString.
