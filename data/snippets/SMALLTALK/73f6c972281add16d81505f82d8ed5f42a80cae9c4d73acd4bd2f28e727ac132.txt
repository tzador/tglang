"| point1 point2 distance |

point1 := 10@5. "create a variable point1 with x-coordinate of 10 and y-coordinate of 5"
point2 := 2@-3. "create a variable point2 with x-coordinate of 2 and y-coordinate of -3"

distance := (point1 - point2) abs. "calculate the absolute distance between point1 and point2 (using Smalltalk's built-in abs method)"

Transcript show: 'The distance between point1 and point2 is: '. "print a string to the output"
