"Create a class called Rectangle
with instance variables height and width"

Object subclass: #Rectangle
	instanceVariableNames: 'height width'

"Create an initialize method that takes in height and width parameters and assigns them to the instance variables"

Rectangle >> initialize: h w
	height := h.
	width := w.

"Create a method that calculates the area of the rectangle
and returns the result as an annotated code snippet"

Rectangle >> calculateArea
	"Calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying the height and width instance variables"
	^ height * width "Return the result as an annotated code snippet"

"Create an instance of the Rectangle class with height 5 and width 10
and assign it to a variable called myRect"

| myRect |
myRect := Rectangle new initialize: 5 10.

"Call the calculateArea method on myRect and print the result as an annotated code snippet"

Transcript show: 'The area of myRect is ' , (myRect calculateArea) printString asAnnotatedCodeSnippet.
