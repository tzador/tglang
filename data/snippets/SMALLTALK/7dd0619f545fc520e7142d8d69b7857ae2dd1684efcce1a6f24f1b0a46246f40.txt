"""This code snippet creates a color picker view with a dictionary of color pairs. The dictionary contains the key-value pairs for different color names and their corresponding color objects. The color picker view is then configured with a size, an action to be sent when a color is selected, and is made to be colorful. Finally, the color picker view is added to the current object's morph at a specific location."""
