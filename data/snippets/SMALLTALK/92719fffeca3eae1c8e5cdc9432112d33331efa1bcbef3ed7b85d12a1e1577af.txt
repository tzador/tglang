" Example code snippet in SMALLTALK to generate and print Fibonacci series "

" Initialize variables for first and second numbers in series "
| first second |
first := 0.
second := 1.
 
" Initialize array to store series "
| series |
series := Array new: 10.

" Loop through each element in the series "
1 to: 10 do: [:i |
 series at: i put: first. " Add first number to array "
 | temp |
 temp := first + second. " Calculate next number in series "
 first := second. " Reassign first and second numbers "
 second := temp.
].

" Print the series "
series do: [:value | Transcript show: value asString; cr]. " Print each element on a new line "
