"Define a method named 'fibonacci' that takes in a positive integer 'n' and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers, starting with 0 and 1."

fibonacci: n
	| first second result |
	first := 0.
	second := 1.
	result := n.
	n > 2 ifTrue: [ 
		1 to: n-1 do: [:i | 
	result := first + second.
        first := second.
        second := result.
    ].
	n > 1 ifTrue: [result := first].
	^result.

"Example usage:"
fibonacci: 6
Output: 8

fibonacci: 10
Output: 55
