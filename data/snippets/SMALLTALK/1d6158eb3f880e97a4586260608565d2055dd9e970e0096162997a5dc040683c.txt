" This is a complicated method that finds the average of all the elements in an array of numbers.
The method takes in one argument, an array of numbers, and returns a float value as the average."

average: numbers
    | sum count |
    sum := 0.
    count := 0.
    numbers do: [:num | sum := sum + num. count := count + 1].
    count = 0 ifTrue: [^ 0.0]. " Checks if array is empty and returns 0.0 if it is."
    
    ^ sum / count. " Returns the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array."
