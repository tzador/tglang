The Pancakes class is created as a subclass of the Object class in SMALLTALK. It contains an instance variable for the ingredients needed to make pancakes.

The Pancakes class also has a class method named 'new' which calls the 'initialize' method. This creates a new instance of the Pancakes class and initializes the ingredients dictionary.

The Pancakes class has two other methods: 'addIngredient' and 'amountOfIngredient'. The 'addIngredient' method takes in an ingredient as a parameter and adds it to the ingredients dictionary, increasing the amount of that ingredient by 1 if it already exists. The 'amountOfIngredient' method returns the amount of a specific ingredient in the ingredients dictionary.

The next lines of code create a new instance of the Pancakes class and add multiple ingredients to it. These ingredients are represented as Smalltalk objects.

The end result is a Pancakes object that contains a list of ingredients and their corresponding amounts. This code snippet demonstrates the use of classes, methods, and dictionaries in SMALLTALK.
