# This is a complex code snippet in RAKU that generates a random number between 1 and 100

my $random = (1..100).pick; # generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the pick method on the Range type

say "The randomly generated number is $random"; # prints the value of $random with a descriptive message

# The code below uses the ternary operator to check if the random number is even or odd
say $random % 2 == 0 ?? "The number is even." !! "The number is odd."; # checks if the random number is divisible by 2 using the modulus operator and outputs a message depending on the result

# The code below creates an array with the previous 10 generated random numbers
my @random_numbers = gather { # creates a new array using the gather and take keywords
    for 1..10 { # runs the loop 10 times to generate 10 random numbers
        take (1..100).pick; # adds each random number to the array using the take keyword
    }
}

say "The previous 10 random numbers are: @random_numbers"; # prints out the contents of the array with a descriptive message

# The code below uses the gather and take keywords to generate a list of numbers and then sums them up
my $sum = gather { # creates a new scalar variable using the gather keyword
    for 1..5 { # runs the loop 5 times to generate 5 random numbers
        my $num = (1..100).pick; # generates a random number using the pick method on the Range type and stores it in a new variable
        take $num; # adds the random number to the list using the take keyword
        say "Adding $num to the sum."; # prints out the value of the random number with a descriptive message
    }
}.sum; # calculates the sum of all the numbers in the list using the sum method

say "The total sum of the generated numbers is $sum"; # prints out the total sum with a descriptive message
