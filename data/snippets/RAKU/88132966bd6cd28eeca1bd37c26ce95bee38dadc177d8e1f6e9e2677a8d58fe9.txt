# This is a code snippet in RAKU that uses multiple functions and variables with comments explaining each step

# Define a variable with an array of numbers
my @numbers = <1 2 3 4 5>;

# Create a function that multiplies each number in the array by 2
sub multiply-by-2 {
  # Get the argument passed to the function
  my $number = shift;
  # Multiply the number by 2 and return the result
  return $number * 2;
}

# Create a function that adds all the numbers in the array
sub add-numbers {
  # Loop through the array and add each number to a total
  my $total = 0;
  for @numbers -> $number {
    $total += $number;
  }
  # Return the total
  return $total;
}

# Use the map function to apply the multiply-by-2 function to each number in the array
my @doubled-numbers = @numbers.map(&multiply-by-2);

# Use the reduce function to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the array
my $sum = @numbers.reduce(&add-numbers);

# Print out the original array, the multiplied array, and the sum of all the numbers
say "Original numbers: " ~ @numbers;
say "Doubled numbers: " ~ @doubled-numbers;
say "Sum of numbers: " ~ $sum;

# Output
# Original numbers: 1 2 3 4 5
# Doubled numbers: 2 4 6 8 10
# Sum of numbers: 15
