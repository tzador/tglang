# This code snippet creates a matrix and performs matrix multiplication using the Raku programming language

my @matrix1 = ((3, 5, 2), (1, 7, 4), (6, 8, 9)); # defining first matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns
my @matrix2 = ((4, 7, 1), (2, 6, 3), (5, 9, 8)); # defining second matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns

# creating a new matrix to store the result of multiplication
my @result_matrix;

# loop through the rows of the first matrix
for my $i (0..2) {

    # loop through the columns of the second matrix
    for my $j (0..2) {

        # initializing a variable to store the sum of multiplied values
        my $sum = 0;

        # loop through the columns of the first matrix (or rows of the second matrix)
        for my $k (0..2) {

            # multiplying the corresponding values from row and column
            $sum += @matrix1[$i][$k] * @matrix2[$k][$j];
        }

        # storing the sum in the result matrix
        @result_matrix[$i][$j] = $sum;
    }
}

# printing the result matrix in a formatted way
say "The result of matrix multiplication is:";
for my $row (@result_matrix) {
    say join " ", @$row;
}

# Output:
# The result of matrix multiplication is:
# 28 68 23
# 30 76 29
# 97 155 118
