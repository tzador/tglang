# This code snippet generates a random password using Raku's built-in
# capability to generate random strings.

my @characters = ('a'..'z', 'A'..'Z', '0'..'9', '_', '*', '-'); # array of characters to use for password
my $password = ''; # variable to store generated password
my $length = 12; # length of password
my $random; # variable to store random character

# loop to generate random password of desired length
for ^$length {
    $random = @characters[rand @characters]; # select random index from array
    $password ~= $random; # concatenate random character to password
}

# output generated password
say "Your randomly generated password is: $password";
