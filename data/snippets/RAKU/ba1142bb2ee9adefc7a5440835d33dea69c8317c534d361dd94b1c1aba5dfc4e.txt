# Raku code for finding the average of a list of numbers

my @numbers = <23 45 12 67 89 43 75>;

# Using a loop to iterate through the list and calculate the sum
my $sum = 0;
for @numbers -> $number {
  $sum += $number;
}

# Calculating the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list
my $average = $sum / @numbers.elems;

# Outputting the result
say "The average of the list is $average.";

# Output: The average of the list is 52.285714285714285
