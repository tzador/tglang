#This code snippet generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit and returns the sequence as a list

#specify the limit of the Fibonacci sequence
my $limit = 10;

#declare an empty list to store the sequence
my @fibonacci;

#initialize the first and second numbers in the sequence
my $first = 0;
my $second = 1;

#loop through the limit and generate the next number in the sequence
for (1..$limit) {

    #push the current number to the list
    @fibonacci.push($first);

    #calculate the next number by adding the previous two numbers
    my $next = $first + $second;

    #reassign the variables for the next iteration
    $first = $second;
    $second = $next;
}

#output the sequence as a list
say @fibonacci;
