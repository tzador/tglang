# This code snippet is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number
multi sub factorial(Int $n) {
  if $n == 0 {
    return 1; # base case, factorial of 0 is 1
  } else {
    return $n * factorial($n - 1); # recursive call to calculate factorial
  }
}

# Main program
my Int $num = 5; # input number
say "Factorial of $num is: " . factorial($num); # prints output
