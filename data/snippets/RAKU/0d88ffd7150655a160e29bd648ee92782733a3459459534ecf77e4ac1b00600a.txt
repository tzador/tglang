# This code snippet uses the RAKU programming language
# It calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion
# Define a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number 
sub factorial($num) {
    if $num == 0 {
        # if the number is 0, return 1 as the factorial
        return 1;
    } else {
        # if the number is not 0, then recursively call the factorial function
        # with the number decreased by 1 and multiply it by the current number
        return $num * factorial($num - 1);
    }
}

# Prompt user to input a number
say "Enter a number to calculate its factorial: ";

# Read user input from standard input and convert to Integer
my $number = prompt() => $!prompt-cleanup;

# Call the factorial function with the user input as parameter
my $factorial = factorial($number);

# Print the result to the console
say "The factorial of $number is: $factorial";
