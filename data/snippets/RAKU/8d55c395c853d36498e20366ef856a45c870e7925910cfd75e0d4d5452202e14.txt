sub string-sort(@array) {
  # This is a subroutine that uses the built-in sort function to sort a given array of strings
  # using the spaceship operator, which compares two strings lexicographically.
  # The sort is case-insensitive, so uppercase and lowercase letters are treated the same.
  # It returns a sorted array as the output.

  return @array.sort({ $^b cmp $^a }); # Sorts the array in descending order
}

my @names = < John Amy Mark Dave Lisa >; # An example array of strings
say string-sort(@names); # Output: ('Mark', 'Lisa', 'John', 'Dave', 'Amy')
