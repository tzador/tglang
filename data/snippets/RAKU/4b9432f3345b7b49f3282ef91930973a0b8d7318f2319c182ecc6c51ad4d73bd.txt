# This is a complex Raku code snippet

# Defining a class named "Person"
class Person {
    has $.name; # Creating a class attribute
    has $.age; # Creating another class attribute
    has @.hobbies; # Creating an array of class attributes

    # Defining a method to print person's info
    method print-person {
        say "Name: ".IO, $.name; # Printing the person's name
        say "Age: ".IO, $.age; # Printing the person's age
        say "Hobbies: ".IO; # Printing the string "Hobbies:" 
        for @.hobbies -> $hobby { # Looping through each hobby
            say "- " .IO, $hobby; # Printing the current hobby
        }
    }
}

# Instantiating a new person object
my $person = Person.new(
    name => "John Doe",
    age => 25,
    hobbies => ["reading", "painting", "hiking"]
);

# Calling the print-person method on the person object
$person.print-person;

# Output:
# Name: John Doe
# Age: 25
# Hobbies:
# - reading
# - painting
# - hiking
