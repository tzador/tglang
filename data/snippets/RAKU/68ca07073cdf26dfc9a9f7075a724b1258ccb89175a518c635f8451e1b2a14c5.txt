# This is a code snippet in RAKU that generates a Fibonacci sequence

my @fib = 1, 1; # initialize the first two numbers in the sequence
my $num = prompt "Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate: "; # prompt user for input
for 3 .. $num { # loop through the sequence starting from the third number
    my $fib = @fib[$_ - 2] + @fib[$_ - 1]; # calculate the fibonacci number using the previous two numbers
    push @fib, $fib; # add the calculated fibonacci number to the sequence
}
say "Fibonacci sequence with $num numbers: @fib.join(', ')"; # output the sequence in a formatted string
