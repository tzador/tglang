# This is a code snippet written in Raku
# It defines a function called 'add' which takes in two integers as parameters and returns the sum of the two integers

# Function to calculate sum of two integers
sub add(Int $x, Int $y) {
    return $x + $y;
}

# Taking input from user
print "Enter first integer: ";
my $num1 = Int(readline());

print "Enter second integer: ";
my $num2 = Int(readline());

# Calling the 'add' function and storing the result in a variable
my $sum = add($num1, $num2);

# Printing the result
say "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum";
