# Defining a class

class Person {
  has $.name;
  has $.age;

  # Defining a method
  method greet () {
    say "Hello! My name is {$.name} and I am {$.age} years old.";
  }

  # Defining a method with parameters
  method celebrate ($occasion) {
    say "{$.name} is celebrating {$occasion}!";
  }
}

# Creating an instance of the Person class
my $person = Person.new(name => "John", age => 25);

# Calling methods on the instance
$person.greet(); // Output: Hello! My name is John and I am 25 years old.

$person.celebrate("birthday"); // Output: John is celebrating birthday!
