# This code snippet uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number
my $num = 5; # change the value of $num to calculate the factorial of a different number
say factorial($num); # finally, print the factorial of the given number

# define a recursive function to calculate the factorial
sub factorial(Int $n) {
    if $n == 0 || $n == 1 { # base case: factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
        return 1; # return 1 to end the recursion
    }
    else { # recursive case
        return $n * factorial($n - 1); # return the product of current number and the factorial of the previous number 
    }
