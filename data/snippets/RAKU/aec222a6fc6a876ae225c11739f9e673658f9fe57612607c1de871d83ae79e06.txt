multi sub fib(Int $n --> Int) {  # creating a multi sub named fib which takes in a single parameter, $n, and returns an Int
    when $n <= 1 { return $n }   # base case: return 0 or 1 if $n is 0 or 1 respectively
    return fib($n-1) + fib($n-2) # recursive case: recursively call fib sub with parameters $n-1 and $n-2 and return sum
}

say fib(10);  # calls fib sub with $n = 10 and prints the result, which is 55
