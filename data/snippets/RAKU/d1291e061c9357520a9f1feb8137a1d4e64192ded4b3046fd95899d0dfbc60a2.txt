# This is a code snippet in RAKU, also known as Perl 6

# Declare a function with a signature
sub say-hi (Str $name is copy, Int $age where {$age < 100}) is export {

    # Declare a variable using the $ sigil
    my $greeting = "Hello, ";

    # Concatenate the name and age variables
    $greeting = $greeting ~ $name ~ "! You are " ~ $age ~ " years old.";

    # Print the final result
    say $greeting;

    # Use a conditional statement to check the name and age
    if $name.eq("John") && $age == 25 {

        # Assign a new value to the greeting variable
        $greeting = "Hello, John! You are exactly 25 years old.";

        # Print the new greeting
        say $greeting;

        # Use a loop to repeat the printing process
        for ^3 {
            say $greeting;
        }
    }
}

# Call the function with the name and age arguments
say-hi("John", 25);
