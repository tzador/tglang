# This program calculates the average of three numbers
my $num1 = 5; # first number 
my $num2 = 10; # second number 
my $num3 = 15; # third number 

# calculating the sum of the numbers 
my $sum = $num1 + $num2 + $num3; 

# calculating the average 
my $average = $sum / 3; 

# printing the result 
say "The average of $num1, $num2, and $num3 is $average"; 

=begin unknown
The output should be:
The average of 5, 10, and 15 is 10
