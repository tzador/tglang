#**Declaring an array of numbers and printing the sum of all even numbers**

#Declare array with numbers
my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

#Declaring variable to store sum
my $sum = 0;

#Loop through the array
for @numbers -> $num {
    
    #Check if current number is even
    if $num %% 2 == 0 {
        
        #Add the even number to the sum
        $sum += $num;
    }
}

#Printing the sum of all even numbers
say "The sum of even numbers is: $sum";

#Output: The sum of even numbers is: 30
