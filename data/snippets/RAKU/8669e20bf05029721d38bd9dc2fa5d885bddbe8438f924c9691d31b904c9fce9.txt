# This is a Raku program that generates a random password with a user-defined length
# The program prompts the user to input a desired length for the password
# The program then uses a loop to generate a random character for each position in the password
# Finally, the program prints the generated password for the user

# Prompt user for desired password length
my $length = prompt "Enter desired password length (must be at least 6 characters): ";

# Define an array with all possible characters for the password (including letters, numbers, and special characters)
my @chars = ('a'..'z', 'A'..'Z', 0..9, '!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '?', '-', '_', '+', '=');

# Generate a random character for each position in the password, using a loop
my $password = '';
for 1..$length {
    $password ~= @chars.pick;
}

# Print the generated password for the user
say "Your random password is: $password";
