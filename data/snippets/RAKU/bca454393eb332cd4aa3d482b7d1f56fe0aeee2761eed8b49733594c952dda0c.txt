# This code snippet uses Raku's built-in List::Util module to calculate the sum of a list of numbers
use List::Util;

# Create a list of numbers
my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

# Use reduce function from List::Util to calculate the sum of all numbers
my $sum = reduce { $^a + $^b }, @numbers;

# Print the sum to the console
say "The sum of the numbers is: $sum";

# Output: The sum of the numbers is: 15
