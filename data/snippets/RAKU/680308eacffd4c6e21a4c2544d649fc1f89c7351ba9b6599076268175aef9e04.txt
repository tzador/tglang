# Define a subroutine that calculates the factorial of a number
sub factorial (Int $num) {
    # Set the initial product to 1
    my $product = 1;

    # For loop to iterate from 1 to $num
    for (1..$num) {
        # Multiply the current $product by the current number in the loop
        $product *= $_;
    }

    # Return the final product
    return $product;
}

# Prompt the user for a number
my $input = prompt("Enter a number: ");

# Convert the input to an Integer
my $num = $input.Int;

# Call the factorial subroutine and store the result in $factorial
my $factorial = factorial($num);

# Print the result to the console
say "The factorial of $num is $factorial";
