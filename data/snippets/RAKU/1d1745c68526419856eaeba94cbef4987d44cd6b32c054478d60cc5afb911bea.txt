# This program calculates and prints the factorial of a given number.

# Define a subprogram that takes in a positive integer as a parameter and 
# calculates its factorial 
sub factorial (Int $num) {
    # If the number is 0 or 1, its factorial is 1 
    if $num == 0 || $num == 1 {
        return 1;
    }
    # Otherwise, use recursion to calculate the factorial 
    return $num * factorial($num-1);
}

# Get user input for the number to calculate the factorial of
print "Enter a positive integer: ";
my $num = get;

# Check if the input is not a positive integer 
while $num < 0 {
    # If it's not, prompt the user to enter a positive integer 
    print "Invalid input. Enter a positive integer: ";
    $num = get;
}

# Call the factorial subprogram and store the result in a variable
my $result = factorial($num);

# Print the result 
say "The factorial of $num is $result.";
