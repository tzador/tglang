# This code snippet shows a complex sorting algorithm in Raku
# It takes an array of numbers as input and uses the bubble sort algorithm to arrange them in ascending order

my @numbers = (5, 2, 7, 1, 9, 3);                      # array of numbers to be sorted
my $i = 0;                                              # initializing the counter variable

loop {                                                  # outer loop to keep iterating until array is sorted
    my $swapped = False;                                # boolean variable to keep track of swaps
    
    for 0..^@numbers.elems - 1 -> $j {                   # inner loop to compare each element with its neighbor
        if @numbers[$j] > @numbers[$j + 1] {            # if current element is larger than next element
            @numbers[$j, $j + 1] = @numbers[$j + 1, $j]; # swap their positions
            $swapped = True;                            # set boolean to true to indicate a swap occurred
        }
    }
    
    last unless $swapped;                               # exit loop if no swaps were made
    
    $i++;                                               # increment counter variable
}

say "Sorted array is: @numbers";                        # print the sorted array
