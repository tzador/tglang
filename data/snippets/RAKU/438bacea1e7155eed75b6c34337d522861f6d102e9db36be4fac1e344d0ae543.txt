my $n = 20; # setting the number of terms to be calculated
for 3..$n -> $i { # iterating through the numbers and starting at 3, since the first two terms are already defined
  @fibonacci-sequence.push( # pushing the calculated term into the array
    @fibonacci-sequence[$i-2] + @fibonacci-sequence[$i-1] # calculating the fibonacci sequence using the previous two terms

# printing the fibonacci sequence
say "The first $n terms of the fibonacci sequence are:"; # saying the output
say @fibonacci-sequence.join(', '); # joining the elements of the array with a comma
