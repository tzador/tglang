# Defining an array
my @array = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

# Using a for loop to iterate through the array and print each element
for @array -> $element {
    print "Current element is: $element\n";
}
# Output: Current element is: 1
#         Current element is: 2
#         Current element is: 3
#         Current element is: 4
#         Current element is: 5

# Creating a hash map
my %hash = ("key1" => "value1", "key2" => "value2", "key3" => "value3");

# Using a for loop to iterate through the hash map and print each key and value pair
for %hash.keys -> $key {
    print "The value for $key is: %hash{$key}\n";
}
# Output: The value for key1 is: value1
#         The value for key2 is: value2
#         The value for key3 is: value3

# Defining a subroutine that checks if a number is prime
sub is_prime($number) {
    for 2 ..^ ($number/2).Int {
        if $number % $_ == 0 {
            return False;
        }
    }
    return True;
}

# Calling the subroutine to check if a given number is prime and printing the result
my $num = 11;
my $is_prime = is_prime($num);
print "$num is prime? $is_prime\n";
# Output: 11 is prime? True

# Defining a class
class Vehicle {
    has $.make; # Creating an attribute for the vehicle's make
    has $.model; # Creating an attribute for the vehicle's model

    method drive() {
        print "Driving the $!make $!model\n";
    }
}

# Creating an instance of the Vehicle class and calling the drive method
my $car = Vehicle.new(make => "Ford", model => "Mustang");
$car.drive();
# Output: Driving the Ford Mustang
