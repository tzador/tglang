# This code snippet creates a variable called $name and assigns the value 'John' to it.
# Then, it uses an if statement to check if the value of $name is 'John'.
# If it is, the code will print the string 'Welcome, John!' using the say function.
# If the value of $name is not 'John', the else statement will be triggered and the code will print the string 'Sorry, I don't recognize you.'.
# This demonstrates the basic usage of variables and conditional statements in RAKU.
