# Example code snippet in RAKU
    # This program calculates the sum of the first 10 natural numbers
    # Using a loop and conditional statements
    
    my $sum = 0; # initialize sum variable to 0
    
    for (1..10) { #loop through numbers 1 to 10
        if ($_ % 2 == 0) { #check if number is even
            $sum += $_; #add number to sum variable
        }
        else { #if number is odd
            $sum -= $_; #subtract number from sum variable
        }
    }
    
    say "The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is $sum"; #print the final sum
