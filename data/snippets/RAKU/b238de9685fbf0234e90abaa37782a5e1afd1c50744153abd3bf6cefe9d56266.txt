# This is a code snippet in Raku
# It includes various functions and data structures

# Define an array
my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

# Define a hash
my %fruits = ('apple' => 'red', 'banana' => 'yellow', 'orange' => 'orange');

# Create a subroutine to calculate the sum of an array
sub calculate-sum(@array) {
   my $total = 0;
   for @array -> $num {
      $total += $num;
   }
   return $total;
}

# Print the sum of the numbers in the array
say "The sum of the numbers is " ~ calculate-sum(@numbers);

# Create a class for a car
class Car {
   has $.color;
   has $.speed = 0;
   
   # Method to accelerate the car
   method accelerate($amount) {
      $!speed += $amount;
   }
}

# Create an instance of a car
my $car = Car.new(color => 'blue');
say "The car's color is " ~ $car.color;

# Accelerate the car by 10 units
$car.accelerate(10);
say "The car's speed is " ~ $car.speed;
