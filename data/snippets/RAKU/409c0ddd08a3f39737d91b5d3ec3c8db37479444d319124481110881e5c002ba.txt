# This is a code snippet in Raku
my @list = 1..10; # create an array of numbers from 1 to 10
my $sum = 0; # initialize the sum variable
for @list -> $num { # for loop to iterate through the array
    $sum += $num; # add each number to the sum variable
}
say "The sum of the numbers in the array is $sum"; # print out the sum
