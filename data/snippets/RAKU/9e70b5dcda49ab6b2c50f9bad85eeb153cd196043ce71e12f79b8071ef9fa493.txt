# This is a code snippet that demonstrates a recursive factorial function in RAKU

# Create a multi sub named "factorial" that takes in one argument, $n
multi sub factorial (Int $n) {
    # Base case: if $n is 0 or 1, return 1
    return 1 if $n == 0 || $n == 1;

    # Recursive case: return the factorial of $n multiplied by the factorial
    # of $n-1
    return $n * factorial($n - 1);
}

# Call the factorial function with a value of 5 and store the result in a 
# variable named $result
my $result = factorial(5);

# Print the result to the console
say "Factorial of 5 is $result";
