# This is a code snippet in Raku which performs a bubble sort algorithm on a given array of numbers.

# define the array of numbers to be sorted
my @numbers = (9,2,6,3,5,8,1,7,4);

# perform the bubble sort algorithm
for 1..@numbers.elems -> $i { # loop from 1 to the number of elements in @numbers
    for 0..^@numbers.elems-$i -> $j { # loop from 0 to the number of elements in @numbers minus the current iteration
        if @numbers[$j] > @numbers[$j+1] { # if the current element is greater than the next element
            # swap the elements using a temporary variable
            my $temp = @numbers[$j+1];
            @numbers[$j+1] = @numbers[$j];
            @numbers[$j] = $temp;
        }
    }
}

# print the sorted array
say "Sorted Array: @numbers";
