#This code snippet creates a class named "Vehicle" with properties "type", "model", "color", "year", "price" and methods "accelerate" and "brake"

class Vehicle {
    has Str $!type; #property to store the type of vehicle
    has Str $!model; #property to store the model of vehicle
    has Str $!color; #property to store the color of vehicle
    has Int $!year; #property to store the year of vehicle
    has Num $!price; #property to store the price of vehicle

    multi method accelerate(Num $speed) { #method to increase vehicle speed
        say "Accelerating to $speed km/h..."
    }

    multi method brake(Num $deceleration) { #method to slow down vehicle
        say "Applying $deceleration m/s^2 of braking force..."
    }
}

#sample usage of the class and its methods
my $car = Vehicle.new(type => "Sedan", model => "Tesla Model 3", color => "Midnight Silver", year=> 2021, price => 40000.00);

$car.accelerate(120);
#Output: Accelerating to 120 km/h...

$car.brake(9.8);
#Output: Applying 9.8 m/s^2 of braking force...
