# This is a simple Raku program that calculates the average of a list of numbers

my @numbers = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; # Declaring an array of numbers to calculate the average
my $sum = 0; # Declaring a variable to store the sum of the numbers
my $average; # Declaring a variable to store the calculated average

for @numbers { # iterating through the array using a for loop
    $sum += $_; # adding the current number to the sum variable
}

$average = $sum / @numbers.elems; # calculating the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array

say "The average of @numbers is: $average"; # displaying the calculated average to the user

# Output: `The average of 1 2 3 4 5 is: 3`
