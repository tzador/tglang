# This code snippet uses and demonstrates the class and object system in Raku.

# Creating a new class called "Person"
# Note: classes in Raku are declared with the "class" keyword followed by the class name, curly braces for the code block, and a semicolon at the end.
class Person {

    # Declaring attributes for the class
    # Note: attributes in Raku are declared with the "has" keyword followed by the attribute name, a colon, and the type of the attribute.
    has Str $.name; # attribute for the person's name
    has Int $.age; # attribute for the person's age
    has Str $.occupation; # attribute for the person's occupation

    # Creating a method to introduce the person
    # Note: methods in Raku are declared with the "method" keyword followed by the method name, curly braces for the code block, and a semicolon at the end.
    method introduce() {
        # Using the interpolating quotes to print out the person's information
        say "Hi, my name is {$.name}, I am {$.age} years old, and I work as a {$.occupation}.";
    }
}

# Creating an instance of the "Person" class
# Note: instances in Raku are created with the "new" keyword followed by the class name and arguments for the attributes.
my $person = Person.new(
    name => "John Doe",
    age => 30,
    occupation => "Software Engineer"
);

# Calling the "introduce" method on the person instance
$person.introduce(); # output: Hi, my name is John Doe, I am 30 years old, and I work as a Software Engineer.
