#/ The following code implements a recursive function
#/ in Raku to print the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.

sub fib(Int $n) {     #/ Declare a recursive function 'fib'
    $n < 2    #/ Base case: if n is less than 2, return n
      ?? $n
      !! fib($n-1) + fib($n-2);   #/ Recursive case: return the sum of previous two terms
}

my $n = 10;    #/ Number of terms to print
say "Fibonacci Sequence up to $n terms:"; 
for 1..$n -> $term {    #/ Loop through numbers from 1 to n
    say fib($term);     #/ Call the 'fib' function and print the result
}
