# This code snippet uses the Raku programming language to generate a sequence of numbers that are divisible by 3
my @numbers = 1..100; # create an array with numbers from 1 to 100
my @divisible_by_3 = @numbers.grep(* %% 3); # use grep to filter out all numbers that are not divisible by 3
say "Numbers divisible by 3: @divisible_by_3"; # print the resulting array in a sentence
