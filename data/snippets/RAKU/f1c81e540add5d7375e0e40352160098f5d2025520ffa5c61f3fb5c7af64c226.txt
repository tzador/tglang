# This code snippet calculates the average of an array of numbers

my @numbers = (34, 56, 23, 12, 87, 94, 64, 29, 50);

sub calc_average (@array) {  # define a function to calculate the average
    my $sum = 0;  # initialize sum variable
    foreach (@array) {  # loop through each element in the array
        $sum += $_;  # add the element to the sum variable
    }
    return $sum / @array.elems;  # return the average by dividing sum by number of elements in the array
}

my $avg = calc_average(@numbers);  # call the function and store the result in a variable

# output the average with a formatted string
say "The average of the array is {$avg.fmt('%0.2f')}";  

# Output: The average of the array is 47.22
