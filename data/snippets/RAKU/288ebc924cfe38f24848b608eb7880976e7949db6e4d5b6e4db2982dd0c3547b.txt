# This code snippet uses Raku's built-in grammar rule 'token' to match a DNA sequence and count the number of nucleotides present.

token nucleotides {
    [A|T|C|G]+                  # match any combination of A, T, C and G
}

my $sequence = "ATCGCGTATGATATAGC" # DNA sequence to be matched

# loop through each nucleotide in the sequence
for $sequence.comb -> $nucleotide {
    # match each nucleotide using the 'nucleotides' token
    if $nucleotide ~~ /<nucleotides>/ {
        # increment the count for the matched nucleotide (stored in $_)
        given $_ {
            when "A" {$count<A>++}
            when "T" {$count<T>++}
            when "C" {$count<C>++}
            when "G" {$count<G>++}
        }
    }
}

# output the results
