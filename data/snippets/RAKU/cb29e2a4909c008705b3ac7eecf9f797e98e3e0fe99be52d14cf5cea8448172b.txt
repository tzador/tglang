# This code snippet generates a random permutation of numbers between 1 and 10

my @list = 1..10; # initialize an array with numbers 1 to 10
my @permuted_list; # initialize an empty array to store permuted numbers
while @list.elems > 0 { # loop until all numbers in the original array are removed
    my $random_index = (^@list.elems).pick; # randomly select an index from the original array
    @permuted_list.push(@list.splice($random_index, 1)); # remove the element at the randomly selected index and add it to the permuted array
}
say @permuted_list.join(" "); # print the permuted array as a string separated by spaces
