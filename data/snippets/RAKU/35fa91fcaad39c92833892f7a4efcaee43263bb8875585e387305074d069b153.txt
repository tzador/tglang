# Declare a variable with an array of numbers

my @numbers = 1..10;

# Create a function with a closure that multiplies each number in the array by a given factor

sub { my $factor = shift; map { $_ * $factor } @numbers };

# Pass in a factor of 5 to the function

my @multiplied = &{ sub { my $factor = shift; map { $_ * $factor } @numbers } }(5);

# Print the result of the function

say @multiplied;
