# This is a code snippet in RAKU that generates a list of numbers using a for loop and adds them to another list

my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); #create an array with some numbers

my @sum; #create an empty array to store the sum of numbers

for @numbers -> $num { #for loop to iterate through each number in the array
    push @sum, $num * $num; #multiply each number by itself and add it to the sum array using push method
}
say @sum; #print the resulting array

# Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] - the resulting array with each number squared
