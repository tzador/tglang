=== EXAMPLE 1 ===

# This program calculates the average of three numbers

my @numbers = (10, 25, 37);	# Array containing the numbers
my $sum = 0;			# Variable to store the sum of the numbers

for @numbers -> $num {		# Loop through each number in the array
    $sum += $num;		# Add the current number to the sum
}

my $average = $sum / @numbers.elems;	# Calculate the average

say $average;	# Output the average

# Output: 24
