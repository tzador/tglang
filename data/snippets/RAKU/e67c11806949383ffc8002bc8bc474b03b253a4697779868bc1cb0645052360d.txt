# This snippet creates a sub which calculates the nth term of a Fibonacci sequence
sub fib (Int $n is copy) { # defining a subroutine named "fib" that takes an integer as input
    # defining two variables to hold the first two values of the sequence
    my Int $first = 0;
    my Int $second = 1;

    for (1..($n-2)) { # using a for loop to iterate through the sequence
        # assigning the next value in the sequence to the variable $next
        my Int $next = $first + $second;
        # reassigning the first and second values for the next iteration
        $first = $second;
        $second = $next;
    }

    return $second; # returning the nth term of the sequence
}

say fib(10); # calling the subroutine with the input value of 10 and printing the result
