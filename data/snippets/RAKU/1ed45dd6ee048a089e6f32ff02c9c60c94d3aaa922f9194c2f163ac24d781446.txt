# This code snippet demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming in Raku
# The class 'Animal' is defined with two attributes and two methods
# The 'speak' method outputs a phrase based on the animal's name and sound
# The 'eat' method increases the animal's age and prints a message
class Animal {
    has $.name;
    has $.sound;

    # Method to make the animal speak
    method speak {
        say "$.name says '$.sound'!";
    }

    # Method to make the animal eat and increase its age
    method eat {
        say "$.name eats and becomes older.";
        $!age++;
    }
}

# Instantiate a new Animal object
my $cat = Animal.new(name => 'Fluffy', sound => 'Meow');

# Call the animal's speak method
$cat.speak; # Output: Fluffy says 'Meow'!

# Call the animal's eat method
$cat.eat; # Output: Fluffy eats and becomes older.
