# This program uses the given input to print a list of numbers and their squares

# create an array of numbers
my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

# create a subroutine to calculate squares
sub calculate-squares(@nums) {
    # define a new empty array for the squares
    my @squares = ();
    
    # loop through the input array
    for @nums -> $num {
        # calculate the square of each number
        my $square = $num ** 2;
        
        # push square to the squares array
        @squares.push($square);
    }
    
    # return the squares array
    return @squares;
}

# call the subroutine and save the results in a variable
my @squares = calculate-squares(@numbers);

# print the list of numbers and their squares
for @numbers Z @squares -> $number, $square {
    say "$number squared is $square";
}

# Output:
1 squared is 1
2 squared is 4
3 squared is 9
4 squared is 16
5 squared is 25
6 squared is 36
