## Define a class named 'Employee' with attributes 'name', 'age', and 'salary'
class Employee {
 	has Str $.name;
 	has Int $.age;
 	has Int $.salary;

 	## Method to print the employee's name, age, and salary
 	method print-info() {
 		say "Employee Name: " ~ $.name;
 		say "Employee Age: " ~ $.age;
 		say "Employee Salary: " ~ $.salary;
 	}

 	## Method to give a raise to the employee's salary
 	method give-raise(Int $amount) {
 		$.salary += $amount;
 		say "Employee " ~ $.name ~ " has received a raise of " ~ $amount;
 		say "New salary: " ~ $.salary;
 	}
}

## Create an instance of the 'Employee' class
my $employee = Employee.new(name => "John", age => 35, salary => 50000);

## Print the employee's information
$employee.print-info();

## Give the employee a raise of $10000
$employee.give-raise(10000);
