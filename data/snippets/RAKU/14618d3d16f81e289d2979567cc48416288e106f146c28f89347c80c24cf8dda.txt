# This code snippet is an example of using Raku's built-in power function to calculate the first 10 powers of 2 and store them in an array called @powers.
my @powers;
 my $n = 2;
 for (1..10) { # loops through values 1 to 10
    @powers.push: $n ** $_; # calculates 2 to the power of current value and adds it to @powers array
 }

 say @powers.join(', '); # prints out all elements in @powers, separated by commas
