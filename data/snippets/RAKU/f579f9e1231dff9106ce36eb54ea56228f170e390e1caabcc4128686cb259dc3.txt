# This code snippet shows a complex loop that iterates through a list of numbers and prints out the squared value of each number

my @numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for @numbers -> $num {
    # creates an iterator for each number in the list
    my $square = $num **= 2; 
    # calculates the squared value of the current number
    say "The squared value of $num is $square."; 
    # prints out the squared value in a string with interpolation
}
