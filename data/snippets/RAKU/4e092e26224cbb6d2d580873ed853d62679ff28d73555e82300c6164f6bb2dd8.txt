my $list = (1..10); # create a list of integers from 1 to 10

for @$list -> $x { # loop through the list using the 'for' loop, using array dereferencing
    say $x * $x; # multiply each element by itself and print the result
}

# OUTPUT:
1 # first element of list squared
4 # second element of list squared
9 # third element of list squared
16 # fourth element of list squared
25 # fifth element of list squared
36 # sixth element of list squared
49 # seventh element of list squared
64 # eighth element of list squared
81 # ninth element of list squared
100 # tenth element of list squared
