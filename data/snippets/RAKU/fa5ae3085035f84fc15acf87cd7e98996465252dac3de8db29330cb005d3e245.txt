# Example code for a function called "calculate_average"
sub calculate_average(@numbers) {

    # Define a variable to hold the total sum
    my $total_sum = 0;

    # Loop through each number in the given list
    for @numbers -> $number {

        # Add the current number to the total sum
        $total_sum += $number;
    }

    # Calculate the average by dividing the total sum by the number of numbers
    my $average = $total_sum / @numbers.elems;

    # Return the calculated average
    return $average;
}

# Example usage of the function
my @numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
say "The average of @numbers is: " ~ calculate_average(@numbers);
