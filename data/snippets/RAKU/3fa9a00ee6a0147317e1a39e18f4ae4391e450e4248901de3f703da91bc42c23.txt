#This is a complex code snippet in RAKU that uses a multi-line for loop
my @numbers = (1..10); #creates an array of numbers from 1 to 10
for @numbers -> $num { #for loop that iterates through each element in the array
    if $num % 2 == 0 { #if statement that checks if the current number is even
        say "$num is even"; #prints the number and a message if it is even
        for ($num + 1)..($num + 5) -> $i { #for loop within the for loop, increments from current number to current number + 5
            say $i; #prints each value of i
        }
    }
    else { #if the number is odd
        say "$num is odd"; #prints the number and a message
        for ($num - 5)..$num -> $i { #another for loop, decrements from current number - 5 to current number
            say $i; #prints each value of i
        }
    }
