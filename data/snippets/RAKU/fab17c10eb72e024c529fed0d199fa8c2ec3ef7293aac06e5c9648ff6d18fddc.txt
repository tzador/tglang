# This is a code snippet that demonstrates the use of a for loop and a conditional statement in the RAKU programming language.

my @num_array = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]; # An array of numbers

for @num_array -> $num { # For loop to iterate through the array
    if $num % 2 == 0 { # Conditional statement to check if the current number is even
        say "The number $num is even.";
    }
    else { # If the number is odd
        say "The number $num is odd.";
    }
}
