# This is a complex code snippet in RAKU

# Define a class
class Person {

    # Attributes
    has $.name;
    has $.age;
    has Str $.occupation is rw;

    # Default constructor
    submethod BUILD( Str $name, Int $age ) {
        $!name = $name;
        $!age = $age;
    }

    # Method to print name and age
    method info( Person:D: ) {
        say "Name: $!name, Age: $!age";
    }

    # Method to update occupation
    method update-occupation( Person:D: Str $new-occupation ) {
        $!occupation = $new-occupation;
    }
}

# Create instances of Person class
my $person1 = Person.new( "John", 30 );
my $person2 = Person.new( "Mary", 25 );

# Call info method on person1
$person1.info();

# Output:
# Name: John, Age: 30

# Call update-occupation method on person2
$person2.update-occupation( "Doctor" );

# Print person2's updated occupation
say $person2.occupation;

# Output:
# Doctor
