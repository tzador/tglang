# This program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion

    if $n == 0 {    // base case, the factorial of 0 is 1
        return 1;

my $num = 5;    // define the number to calculate factorial for
say "Factorial of $num is " ~ factorial($num);  // print the result

# Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
