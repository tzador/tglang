# This is a code snippet in Raku that creates a Fibonacci sequence and outputs the first ten numbers
my @fibonacci-seq = (1, 1); # initialize array with first two numbers in sequence
for 2..10 { # loop from 2 to 10
  @fibonacci-seq[$_] = @fibonacci-seq[$_-1] + @fibonacci-seq[$_-2]; # each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers
}
say @fibonacci-seq.antipairs; # output the first ten numbers in the sequence using antipairs (key-value pairs in reversed order)
