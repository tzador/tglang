# This code calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion in Raku 

# Defining a sub-routine called factorial that takes in a parameter 'n'
sub factorial (Int $n) {
    # Using a conditional statement to check if 'n' is equal to 0
    if $n == 0 {
        # If 'n' is 0, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
        return 1;
    } else {
        # If 'n' is not 0, multiply it with the factorial of 'n-1' using recursion
        return $n * factorial($n - 1);
    }

# Taking user input for the number whose factorial is to be calculated
print "Enter a number: ";

# Calling the factorial sub-routine and passing in the user input

# Printing the result
