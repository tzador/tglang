# This code snippet will generate a Fibonacci sequence up to the inputted number
# Define a subroutine called 'fibonacci' with one parameter 'num'
sub fibonacci (num) {
  # Set initial values of sequence
  my $first = 0;
  my $second = 1;
  
  # Print first two numbers of sequence
  say $first;
  say $second;
  
  # Define a 'for' loop to iterate through the sequence
  for 2..num {
    # Set 'next_number' to the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence
    my $next_number = $first + $second;
    
    # Print the next number in the sequence
    say $next_number;
    
    # Update the values of 'first' and 'second' to continue the sequence
    $first = $second;
    $second = $next_number;
  }
}

# Call the 'fibonacci' subroutine and pass in the desired number
fibonacci(10);
