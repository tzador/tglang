# This is a program written in Raku
# It calculates the average of a given list of numbers

# Define a subroutine to calculate the average, it takes in a list of numbers as the argument
sub calculate_average(@list){
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of the numbers in the list
    my $sum = 0;
    
    # Loop through the list and add each number to the sum
    for @list -> $num {
        $sum += $num;
    }
    
    # Get the total number of elements in the list
    my $list_size = @list.elems;
    
    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements
    my $average = $sum / $list_size;
    
    # Return the average
    return $average;
}

# Define a list of numbers
my @numbers = (10, 15, 20, 25, 30);

# Call the calculate_average subroutine with the list as the argument
my $result = calculate_average(@numbers);

# Print the result
say "The average of @numbers is: $result";
