#This code snippet finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm

sub gcd(Int $a, Int $b) {
    while $b != 0 {
        my $temp = $b;
        $b = $a % $b;
        $a = $temp;
    }
    return $a;
}

#Input numbers
my $num1 = 24;
my $num2 = 36;

#Print result
say "The greatest common divisor of $num1 and $num2 is " ~ gcd($num1, $num2);
