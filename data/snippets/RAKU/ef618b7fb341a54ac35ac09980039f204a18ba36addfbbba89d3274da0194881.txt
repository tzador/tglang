# This is a code snippet in Raku
# It generates a custom hash containing names, ages, and occupations
my %person = (
	"name" => "John Doe", # Key is "name", value is "John Doe"
	"age" => 35, # Key is "age", value is 35
	"occupation" => "Software Developer" # Key is "occupation", value is "Software Developer"
);

# Loop through the hash and print out the values in a sentence
for %person.kv -> $key, $value { # "kv" means key-value pair
	say "This person's $key is $value."; # Print out sentence with the current key and value
}

# Output:
# This person's name is John Doe.
# This person's age is 35.
# This person's occupation is Software Developer.
