This is a code snippet in Raku that uses nested loops to find all possible combinations
of four letters from the alphabet.

my @alphabet = <a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z>; # creates an array of all letters of the alphabet

for @alphabet -> $letter1 { # loops through each letter in the alphabet
