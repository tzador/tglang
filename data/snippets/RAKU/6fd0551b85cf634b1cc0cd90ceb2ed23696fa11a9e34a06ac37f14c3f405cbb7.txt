# This is a simple Raku program to calculate the factorial of a number

my $number = 5; # Change this to any integer to find factorial

my $factorial = 1; # Initialize the factorial variable

while ($number > 0) { # Create a loop to iterate through numbers

    $factorial *= $number; # Multiply the factorial with the current number

    $number--; # Decrement the number to move to the next number in the loop
}

say "Factorial of $number is $factorial"; # Print the result

# Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
