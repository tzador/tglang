# This is a code snippet in Raku
# It demonstrates the use of loops and variables
my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); # creates an array of numbers
my $sum = 0; # initializes a variable to hold the sum
for @numbers -> $num { # iterate through the array using for loop
    $sum += $num; # add the current number to the sum
}
print "The sum of the numbers is: $sum"; # print the result
