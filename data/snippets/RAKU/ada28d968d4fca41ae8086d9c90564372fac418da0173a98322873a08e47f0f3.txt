# This is a complex code snippet in Raku

# This program generates a list of prime numbers up to a given number
# The user inputs the number as a command line argument

# Declare a variable to store the input number
my $number = @*ARGS[0];

# Declare a variable to store the list of prime numbers
my @primes = ();

# Loop through each number starting from 2 up to the input number
for 2..$number -> $i {

    # Declare a variable to store the number of factors of $i
    my $factor_count = 0;

    # Loop through each number starting from 1 up to the current number $i
    for 1..$i {
        
        # Check if the current number is a factor of $i
        if $i %% $_ {
            
            # If it is a factor, increase the factor count by 1
            $factor_count++;
        }
        
        # If the factor count is greater than 2, break out of the loop
        if $factor_count > 2 {
            last;
        }
    }

    # If the factor count is 2, it means the number is prime and can be added to the list
    if $factor_count == 2 {
        push @primes, $i;
    }
}

# Print the list of prime numbers in a formatted way
say "Prime numbers up to $number:";

for @primes -> $prime {
    say " - $prime";
}

# Output:
#
# Prime numbers up to 10:
#  - 2
#  - 3
#  - 5
#  - 7
