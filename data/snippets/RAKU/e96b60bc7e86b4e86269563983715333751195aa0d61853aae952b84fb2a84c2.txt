# This is a code snippet in Raku programming language, which is used for general-purpose programming and has a syntax that emphasizes human readability

my @numbers = (1..10); # assigning a list of numbers to an array variable
my $sum = 0; # initializing a sum variable
my $average; # declaring an average variable

for @numbers -> $num { # a for loop that iterates through the list of numbers
    $sum += $num; # adding each number to the sum variable
}

$average = $sum / @numbers.elems; # calculating the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
say "The average of @numbers is: $average"; # printing the average to the console

# Output: The average of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 is: 5.5
