my @list = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); # Creates an array containing the numbers 1-5
my %result; # Creates an empty hash

for @list -> $number { # Loop through each element in the @list array
    my $square = $number * $number; # Square the current element
    %result{$number} = $square; # Add the square value to the hash with the current element as the key
}

say %result; # Print the resulting hash with the squared values for each element in the @list array
