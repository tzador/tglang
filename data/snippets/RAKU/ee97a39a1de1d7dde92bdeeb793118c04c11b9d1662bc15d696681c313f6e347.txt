# This is a code example showcasing the use of classes and methods in Raku

# Define a class named 'Person' with attributes 'name' and 'age'
class Person {
    has Str $.name;
    has Int $.age;

    # Constructor method for the class
    method new(Str $name, Int $age) {
        my $self = self.bless();
        $self.name = $name;
        $self.age = $age;
        return $self;
    }

    # Method to retrieve and print the person's name
    method get_name() {
        say "The person's name is {$self.name}";
    }

    # Method to retrieve and print the person's age
    method get_age() {
        say "The person's age is {$self.age}";
    }
}

# Create a new instance of the 'Person' class
my $person = Person.new("John", 25);

# Call the methods to print the person's name and age
$person.get_name();
$person.get_age();

# Output:
# The person's name is John
# The person's age is 25
