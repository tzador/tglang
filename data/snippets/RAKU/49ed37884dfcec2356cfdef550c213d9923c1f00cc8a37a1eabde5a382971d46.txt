# this code snippet generates a random password
my @chars = ("a".."z", "A".."Z", "0".."9"); # creates an array containing all possible characters
my $password = ""; # initialize an empty string
for (1..10) { # loop through 10 times to generate a 10-character password
    $password = $password ~ @chars.pick; # append a randomly selected character from the array to the password string
}
# $password now contains a random password with 10 characters
say $password; # print the generated password
