# Define a class
class Car {
  has $.make; # attribute for car make
  has $.model; # attribute for car model

  submethod BUILD(:$make, :$model) { # constructor method
    $!make = $make; # assign make value to attribute
    $!model = $model; # assign model value to attribute
  }

  method info { # method to print car information
    say "This car is a $!make $!model."; # print statement with make and model attribute values
  }
}

# Define an instance of Car
my $car = Car.new(make => "Ford", model => "Mustang");
