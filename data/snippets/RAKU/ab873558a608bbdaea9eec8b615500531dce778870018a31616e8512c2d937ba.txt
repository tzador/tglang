# This code snippet creates a subsequence from an array and passes it to a subroutine to return the product of the subsequence

my @nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; # create an array of numbers
my $start = 1; # define starting index for subsequence
my $end = 4; # define ending index for subsequence

# create a subroutine to calculate the product of a given subsequence
sub get_product(@arr, $start, $end) {
    my $product = 1; # initialize product variable
    
    for @arr[$start..$end] -> $element { # loop through subsequence
        $product *= $element; # multiply each element to product
    }
    
    return $product; # return product value
}

my @subseq = @nums[$start..$end]; # create subsequence from original array

say "The product of the subsequence from index $start to $end is: " ~ get_product(@subseq, $start, $end); # output product of subsequence
