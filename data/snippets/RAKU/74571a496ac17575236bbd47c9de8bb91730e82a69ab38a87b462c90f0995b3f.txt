# This Raku program calculates the factorial of a number

sub factorial($n) { # defining a sub-routine called 'factorial'
    if $n == 0 {     # condition to check if input is 0
        return 1;    # if yes, factorial is 1
    } else {         # if not, recursive call to calculate factorial
        return $n * factorial($n-1); # multiply current number with factorial of n-1
    }
}

my $n = 5; # defining the number whose factorial we want to calculate
my $result = factorial($n); # calling the function and storing the result in a variable
say "Factorial of $n is $result"; # printing the output

# Output:
# Factorial of 5 is 120
