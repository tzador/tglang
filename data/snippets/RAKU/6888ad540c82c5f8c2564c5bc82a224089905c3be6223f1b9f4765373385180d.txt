# Creating a new instance of Shape class
my $circle = Shape.new('red', 10);

# Calling the paint method
say $circle.paint('blue');      # Output: Shape has been painted blue.

# Calling the scale method
say $circle.scale(2);           # Output: Shape has been scaled to 200% of its original size.

# Calling the info method
say $circle.info;               # Output: Shape has a color of blue and a size of 20.
