# This RAKU code snippet is used to create a function that calculates the factorial of a number recursively
# It takes in a single integer as its argument

sub factorial($num) {
    # Base case for recursion
    if $num == 1 {
        return 1;
    }
    # Recursive call to calculate factorial
    return $num * factorial($num - 1);
}

# Output: factorial of 5 is 120
say factorial(5);
