# This is a code snippet in Raku that creates a hash and extracts the values using a loop
# First, we declare a new hash with key-value pairs
my %hash = (
  'name' => 'John',
  'age' => 25,
  'occupation' => 'Software Engineer'
);
# Then we declare a variable to store the keys
my @keys;
# Next, we use a loop to extract the keys from the hash and push them into the @keys array
for %hash.keys -> $key {
  push @keys, $key;
}
# We will then print the values of each key using another loop
for @keys -> $key {
  say "$key: %hash{$key}";
}
# Output:
# name: John
# age: 25
# occupation: Software Engineer
