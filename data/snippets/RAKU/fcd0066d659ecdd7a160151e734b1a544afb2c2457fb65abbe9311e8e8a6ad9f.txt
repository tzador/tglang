# Define a class
class Person {
  has $.name; # This is a public attribute
  has $.age; # This is also a public attribute
  has $!salary; # This is a private attribute

  method info { # This is a method to print information about the person
    say "Name: {$!name}";
    say "Age: {$!age}";
    say "Salary: {$!salary}";

}

# Create an instance of the Person class
my $person = Person.new(name => "John", age => 30, salary => 50000);

# Call the info method on the instance
$person.info;
