# This code snippet uses the RAKU programming language
# to generate a sorted list of numbers and print them out.

my @numbers = <15 3 7 22 1 9>;  # declare and initialize an array of numbers

say "Unsorted Numbers:";  # print a message indicating unsorted numbers
say @numbers.join(', ');  # print out the unsorted numbers separated by commas

@numbers.=sort;  # sort the numbers in ascending order

say "Sorted Numbers:";  # print a message indicating sorted numbers
say @numbers.join(', ');  # print out the sorted numbers separated by commas
