## This code snippet demonstrates the use of for loops and if statements in RAKU
for @numbers -> $num {
    if $num % 2 == 0 { # Checks if the number is even
        say "This number is even!";
    }
    else {
        say "This number is odd!";
    }
}

# This code snippet also includes the use of hash variables and string concatenation
for %hash.kv -> $key, $value {
    say "$key is equal to $value";
}
