#The code snippet is a subroutine written in RAKU (previously known as Perl 6) that takes in a string argument and returns a reversed string. It uses the `sub` keyword to define the subroutine, which is followed by the name of the subroutine, `reverse-string`. The parameters of the subroutine are designated using the `where` keyword, and in this case, it specifies that the parameter, `$str`, must be a string with a character length greater than 1.

Next, the code block within curly braces `{}` contains the actual code for the subroutine. As the name implies, the `reverse-string` subroutine uses the `reverse` keyword to reverse the given string. To make sure the string is in a form that can be reversed, the `comb` method is used to split the string into individual characters. The `reverse` keyword then reverses the order of the characters, and the `join` method concatenates the characters back together to form a reversed string.

Finally, the subroutine ends with a `return` statement, which returns the reversed string as the output of the subroutine.

Inside the annotations, a description of the subroutine is provided using the `#|` syntax. This describes the purpose of the subroutine, as well as any valid input for the subroutine.

The code snippet ends with a closing triple backtick, indicating the end of the code block, and the output of the subroutine is not explicitly shown, as per the given instructions.
