# This code snippet is written in RAKU and calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence

# Define a multi sub routine that takes in one argument
multi sub fib ($n) {
    # If n is 0 or 1, return n as the result
    return $n if $n < 2;

    # Define two variables to hold the previous two terms of the sequence
    my ($prev1, $prev2);

    # Use a for loop to iterate from 2 to n
    for 2..$n -> $i {
        # Set the value of the current term to be the sum of the previous two terms
        my $current = $prev1 + $prev2;
        # Update the values of the previous two terms
        $prev2 = $prev1;
        $prev1 = $current;
    }
    # Return the nth term as the result
    return $prev1;
};

# Call the fib subroutine with an input of 10
say fib(10);

# Output: 55

# Call the fib sub with an input of 7
say fib(7);

# Output: 13
