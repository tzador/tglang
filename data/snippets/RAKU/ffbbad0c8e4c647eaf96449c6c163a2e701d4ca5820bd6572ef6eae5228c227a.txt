# Example of a function that takes an array as input and returns the sum of all the elements in the array

sub sum-array(@array) {
  my $sum = 0;                             # declare a variable to store the sum
  for @array -> $number {                  # loop through each element in the array
    $sum += $number;                       # add the current element to the sum
  }
  return $sum;                             # return the sum
}

# Example of calling the function and storing the result in a variable
my @numbers = (1, 5, 8, 2, 10);            # initialize the array with some numbers
my $total = sum-array(@numbers);           # call the function and store the result in a variable

say "The total sum of the array is $total"; # print the result to the screen
