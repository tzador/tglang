# defining a class Animal with attributes and methods

class Animal {
  has $.name;

  has $.species;
  
  method greet(Str $message) {
    say "Hello, my name is $.name and I am $.age years old. $message";

    say "$.name is a $.species who is $.age years old.";
  }

# creating instances of the Animal class

my $bear = Animal.new(name => "Yogi", age => 10, species => "bear");
my $tiger = Animal.new(name => "Tony", age => 5, species => "tiger");

# calling methods on instances of the Animal class

$bear.greet("Nice to meet you!");
#=> Hello, my name is Yogi and I am 10 years old. Nice to meet you!
$tiger.describe;
#=> Tony is a tiger who is 5 years old.
$bear.speak("Roar!");
#=> Yogi says Roar!
