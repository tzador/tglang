# This is a code snippet in RAKU that creates a hash map with nested arrays as values and prints the sum of all the numbers in the arrays.
my %hash = (
    'numbers' => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'more_numbers' => [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
);

my $sum = 0; # variable to store the sum

# loop through the values of each key in the hash
for %hash.values -> $value {
    # if the value is an array
    if $value ~~ Array {
        # loop through the numbers in the array and add them to the sum
        for $value.list -> $num {
            $sum += $num;
        }
    }
}

# print the sum
say "The sum of all the numbers in the hash is: $sum";
