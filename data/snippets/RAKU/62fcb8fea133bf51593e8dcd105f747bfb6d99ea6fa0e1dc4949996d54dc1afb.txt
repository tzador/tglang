# This is a code snippet in Raku that calculates the average of a list of numbers.
my @list = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); # define a list of numbers
my $sum = 0; # initialize the sum variable
my $avg; # declare the average variable
for @list -> $num { # start a for loop to iterate through the list
    $sum += $num; # add each number to the sum
}
$avg = $sum / @list.elems; # calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list
say "Average: $avg"; # print the result
