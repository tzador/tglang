# Here we are declaring a class called Person with three attributes
class Person {
    has Str $.name;
    has Int $.age;
    has Str $.occupation;

    # This is the constructor for the Person class, it takes in three parameters: name, age, and occupation
    submethod TWEAK (:$name, :$age, :$occupation) {
        self.name = $name;
        self.age = $age;
        self.occupation = $occupation;
    }

    # This is a method that returns a string with information about the person's name, age, and occupation
    method describe {
        return "$.name is $.age years old and works as a $.occupation.";
    }
}

# Here we create a new instance of the Person class and pass in values for the attributes
my $person = Person.new(name => "John", age => 32, occupation => "Software Engineer");

# This will print out the string returned by the describe method
say $person.describe();

# Output: John is 32 years old and works as a Software Engineer.
