# This is a code snippet in Raku

# Define an array with numbers
my @numbers = (1..10);

# Define a variable to store the total
my $total = 0;

# Use loop to iterate through the array and add numbers to the total
for @numbers -> $num {
    $total += $num;
}

# Print the total
say "The total is $total";
