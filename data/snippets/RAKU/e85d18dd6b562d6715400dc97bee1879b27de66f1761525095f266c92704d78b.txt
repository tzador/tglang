# This is a subroutine that calculates the factorial of a given number
#
# Arguments:
# n - the number to calculate factorial for
sub factorial(Int $n) {
  my $result = 1;
  # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n and multiply each one to the result
  for my $i (1..$n) {
    $result *= $i;
  }
  # Return the final result
  return $result;
}

# Example usage:
# Calculate factorial of 5 and assign it to a variable
my $factorial_result = factorial(5);
# Print the result
say "The factorial of 5 is: $factorial_result";
