# This code snippet demonstrates a recursive factorial function in Raku

sub factorial (Int $n) { # Defines the factorial function, takes an integer
    if $n <= 1 { # Base case, when n is 0 or 1, return 1
        return 1;
    }
    else { # Recursive case, multiply n with factorial of n-1
        return $n * factorial($n - 1);
    }
}

say factorial(5); # Output: 120
say factorial(10); # Output: 3628800
say factorial(0); # Output: 1 (base case)

### Explanation:
# The code first defines a function called 'factorial' that takes an integer as input. 
# A base case is checked where if the input is 0 or 1, the function returns 1. 
# If the input is not 0 or 1, the function recursively calls itself and multiplies the input with the factorial of n-1. 
# Finally, the code prints out the factorial of 5, 10, and 0 by calling the function and passing in the respective inputs.
