# This code snippet creates a class for a person with three attributes: name, age, and occupation
class Person {
  has $.name; # this is a Str attribute for name
  has $.age; # this is an Int attribute for age
  has $.occupation; # this is a Str attribute for occupation
  
  method speak() { # this method prints out a greeting with the person's name and occupation
    say "Hello, my name is {$!name} and I am a {$!occupation}.";
  }
  
  method is_senior() { # this method checks if the person is a senior based on their age and returns a boolean
    if $!age >= 65 {
      return True;
    } else {
      return False;
    }
  }
}

# creating an instance of the Person class with values for the attributes
my $person = Person.new(name => "John", age => 30, occupation => "teacher");

# calling the speak method on the person object
$person.speak(); # outputs "Hello, my name is John and I am a teacher."

# calling the is_senior method on the person object
$person.is_senior(); # outputs False since John is not yet a senior citizen
