# This is a code snippet that uses RAKU (formerly known as Perl 6) programming language.
# It defines a class named Person with three attributes: name, age, and occupation.
# The class has three methods: new(), set-info(), and get-info().

class Person {
    has $.name; # attribute name
    has $.age; # attribute age
    has $.occupation; # attribute occupation

    # method to initialize object with name, age, and occupation

            age => $age,
            occupation => $occupation,
        );
    }

        $!age = $age;

    # method to get values for name, age, and occupation
    method get-info () {
        my $info = "Name: $!name\nAge: $!age\nOccupation: $!occupation";

        return $info;
    }
}

# create new object of class Person
my $person = Person.new("John", 25, "Software Developer");

# call get-info method to get object's info
