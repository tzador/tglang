This code snippet creates an array of numbers from 1 to 10 and defines a subroutine to check if a given number is odd. 
Then, it iterates through the array and calls the subroutine for each element, printing whether it is odd or even.
The output would be: 
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
6 is even
7 is odd
8 is even
9 is odd
10 is even
