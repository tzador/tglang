# This is a complex code snippet in Raku that integrates arrays and loops to print a Fibonacci sequence

my @fibonacci = (0, 1); # initialize an array with the first two values of the sequence
my $num = 10; # specify the number of elements in the sequence (starting from the third element)

for 2..($num - 1) { # loop through the indexes of the remaining elements
    @fibonacci[$_]= @fibonacci[$_-1] + @fibonacci[$_-2]; # calculate and assign the value at the current index 
}

say "The first $num numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:"; # print a message to indicate the start of the sequence

for @fibonacci { # loop through each element in the array
    say $_; # print the current element
}
