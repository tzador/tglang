# This code snippet uses the key-value pair data structure to create a hash of countries and their continents
my %countries = (
    'Russia' => 'Europe',
    'China' => 'Asia',
    'USA' => 'North America',
    'Brazil' => 'South America',
    'Australia' => 'Oceania',
    'South Africa' => 'Africa',
    'Greenland' => 'North America',
    'India' => 'Asia',
    'Mexico' => 'North America',
);

# Here we use a loop to iterate through the hash and print out the country and its corresponding continent
for %countries.kv -> $country, $continent {
    say "$country is in $continent."
}

# Output:
# Russia is in Europe.
# China is in Asia.
# USA is in North America.
# Brazil is in South America.
# Australia is in Oceania.
# South Africa is in Africa.
# Greenland is in North America.
# India is in Asia.
# Mexico is in North America.
