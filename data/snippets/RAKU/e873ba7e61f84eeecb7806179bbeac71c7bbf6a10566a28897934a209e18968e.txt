sub sum(@nums) { # Defines a subroutine named sum that takes an array of numbers as input
    my $sum = 0; # Declares a variable $sum and initializes it with a value of 0
    for @nums -> $num { # Loop through each number in the input array
         $sum += $num; # Add the current number to the sum
    }
    return $sum; # Return the final sum
 }

say sum([1, 2, 3]); # Call the sum subroutine and pass in an array of numbers as input
# Output: 6
