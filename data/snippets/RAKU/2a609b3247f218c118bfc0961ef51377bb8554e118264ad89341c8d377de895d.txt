# This code snippet generates a series of Fibonacci numbers up to a given number

my $n = 10; # the maximum number in the series
my @fib = (0,1); # initialize the first two numbers in the series

# loop through each number up to the maximum
for (1..$n) {
    # calculate the next number in the series and add it to the array
    push @fib, @fib[*-1] + @fib[*-2];
}

# print the final array of Fibonacci numbers
say "The Fibonacci series up to $n is: {@fib}";
