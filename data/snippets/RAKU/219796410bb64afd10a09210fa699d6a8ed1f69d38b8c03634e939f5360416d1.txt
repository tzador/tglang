# This code snippet uses the Raku programming language
# It creates a class called Person with attributes "name" and "age"

class Person {
    has Str $.name;
    has Int $.age;

    method birthday () {
        $!age++;
        say "Happy birthday to $!name, who is now $!age years old!";
    }

    method greet () {
        say "Hello, my name is $!name and I am $!age years old.";
    }
}

# Instantiating two objects using the Person class

my $jane = Person.new(name => "Jane", age => 30);
my $john = Person.new(name => "John", age => 35);

# Calling methods on the objects

$jane.greet; # Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I am 30 years old.
$john.birthday; # Output: Happy birthday to John, who is now 36 years old.
