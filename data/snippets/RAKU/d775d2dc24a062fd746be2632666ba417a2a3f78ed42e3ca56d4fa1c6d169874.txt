# This code snippet uses the Hash data structure in RAKU to map different fruits to their respective colors 
my %fruit_colors = (
  'apple' => 'red', 
  'banana' => 'yellow', 
  'orange' => 'orange',
  'grape' => 'purple',
  'watermelon' => 'green',
  'strawberry' => 'red',
  'blueberry' => 'blue',
  'coconut' => 'white'
);

# Loop through each fruit-color pair and print out the key and value
for %fruit_colors.kv -> $fruit, $color {
  say "$fruit is $color";
}

# Output:
#
# apple is red
# banana is yellow
# orange is orange
# grape is purple
# watermelon is green
# strawberry is red
# blueberry is blue
# coconut is white
