# This is a complex code snippet in Raku (formerly known as Perl 6)

# Declare a class
class Person {
    has $.name;  # Declare an attribute

    # Declare a method
    method say-hello($greeting) {
        say "$greeting, $.name!";
    }
}

# Create an instance of the Person class
my $person = Person.new(name => "John Smith");

# Call the say-hello method on the instance
$person.say-hello("Hello");  # Output: Hello, John Smith!
