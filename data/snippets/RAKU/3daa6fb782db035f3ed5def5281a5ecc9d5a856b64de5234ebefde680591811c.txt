# This code snippet defines a class called "Person"

    # This is a constructor method that initializes the attributes name and age

        if self.age < 18 {

# Creating an object of the class "Person" with name and age as arguments for the constructor
my $person = Person.new("John Doe", 25);

# Calling the method "full_name" on the person object and printing the output
say $person.full_name(); # Output: John Doe

# Calling the method "is_minor" on the person object and printing the output
say $person.is_minor(); # Output: False
