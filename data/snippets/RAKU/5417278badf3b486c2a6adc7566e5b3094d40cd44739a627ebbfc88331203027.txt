# This is a RAKU code snippet that uses a module to calculate and print out the average of a list of numbers.

use Statistics::Basic;

my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

my $average = Statistics::Basic.mean(@numbers); # using the mean function from the Statistics::Basic module

say "The average of the numbers is $average."; # printing out the result

# Output: The average of the numbers is 3.
