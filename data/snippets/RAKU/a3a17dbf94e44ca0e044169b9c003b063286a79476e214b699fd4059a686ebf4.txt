# this is a code snippet in Raku, also known as Perl 6

# define a class called 'Person'
class Person {
  has $.name; # attribute for person's name
  has $.age; # attribute for person's age

  # method for printing person's information
  method print-info() {
    say "Name: " ~ self.name;
    say "Age: " ~ self.age;
  }

  # method for checking if person is an adult
  method is-adult() {
    if self.age >= 18 {
      return True;
    }
    else {
      return False;
    }
  }
}

# create two instances of the Person class
my $person1 = Person.new(name => "John", age => 25);
my $person2 = Person.new(name => "Lily", age => 16);

# call the print-info method for each person
$person1.print-info();
$person2.print-info();

# call the is-adult method for each person
say $person1.name ~ " is an adult? " ~ $person1.is-adult();
say $person2.name ~ " is an adult? " ~ $person2.is-adult();

# output:
# Name: John
# Age: 25
# Name: Lily
# Age: 16
# John is an adult? True
# Lily is an adult? False
