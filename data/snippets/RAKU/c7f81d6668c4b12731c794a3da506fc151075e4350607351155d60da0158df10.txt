# This is a code snippet in RAKU that uses a for loop to find the factorial of a number

# Function to calculate factorial
sub factorial($num) {
    # Initializing sum variable
    my $sum = 1;
    
    # Loop to calculate factorial
    for 1..$num -> $i {
        $sum *= $i;
    }
    
    # Return the factorial
    return $sum;
}

# Input number
my $num = 5;

# Call factorial function and save result
my $factorial = factorial($num);

# Print the result
say "The factorial of $num is: $factorial";

# Output:
# The factorial of 5 is: 120
