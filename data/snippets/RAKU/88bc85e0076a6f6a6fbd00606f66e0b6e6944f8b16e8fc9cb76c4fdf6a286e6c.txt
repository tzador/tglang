# Define a class called "Person"
class Person {

	# Define a method to introduce the person and their age
	method introduce {

# Create a list of Person objects
my @people = (
	Person.new(name => "John", age => 35),
	Person.new(name => "Sarah", age => 28),

# Use a for loop to call the introduce method on each Person object
for @people -> $person {

# Output:
