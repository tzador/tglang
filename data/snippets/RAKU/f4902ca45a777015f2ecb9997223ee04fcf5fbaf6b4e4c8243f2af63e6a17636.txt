# This code snippet generates the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive function

sub fib($n) {
    return 1 if $n < 2; # base case, returns 1 for n = 0 and 1
    return fib($n-1) + fib($n-2); # recursive case, calls the function with the previous two numbers in the sequence and adds them together
}

my @fibonacci-sequence = (1, 1); # initialize array with first two numbers in the sequence
for 2..19 { # loop to generate the next 18 numbers
    push @fibonacci-sequence, fib($_); # push the result of calling the fib function with the current number as an argument
}

say "The first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: @fibonacci-sequence"; # prints the result in a readable format
