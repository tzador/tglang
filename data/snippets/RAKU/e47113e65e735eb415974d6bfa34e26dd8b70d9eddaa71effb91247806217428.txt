# This code snippet uses Rakudo programming language, also known as Raku.

# The code below creates a class called Person.
class Person {

    # The "has" keyword acts as an attribute/property-like function.
    # In this case, it creates two attributes: name and age.
    has $.name;
    has $.age;

    # The constructor creates a new object of the Person class with the required parameters.
    # It sets the values of the attributes to the given parameters.
    method new($name, $age) {
        self.bless(name => $name, age => $age);
    }

    # A method to print out the person's information in a formatted way.
    method info() {
        say "Name: {$!name}, Age: {$!age}";
    }
}

# Creating a new object of the Person class and passing in values for the attributes.
my $person = Person.new("John", 25);

# Calling the info method on the person object, which outputs the information in a formatted way.
$person.info();
