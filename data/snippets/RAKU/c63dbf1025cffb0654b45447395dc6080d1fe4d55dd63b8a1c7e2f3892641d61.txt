This code snippet is an example of how variables and data structures
can be defined and used in RAKU programming language.

- The first line declares a variable named $num and assigns it a value of 10.
- The second line declares an array named @numbers and assigns it a range of numbers from 1 to 10.
- The third line declares a hash named %hash and assigns it three key-value pairs.

The keyword "say" is used to print the values of the variables or data structures to the console.

The output of this code would be:

10
[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]
[1 => one 2 => two 3 => three]
