# An example of a complex Raku code snippet

# Define a class called Person
class Person {
    has $.name;
    has Int $.age;

    # Create a method to print the person's name and age
    method print_details() {
        say "$.name is $.age years old.";
    }
}

# Create instances of the Person class
my $person1 = Person.new(name =>"John", age => 30);
my $person2 = Person.new(name => "Jane", age => 25);

# Call the print_details method for each person
$person1.print_details(); # John is 30 years old.
$person2.print_details(); # Jane is 25 years old.

# Define a subroutine that calculates the average age of a list of Person objects
sub calculate_average_age(@people) {
    my $total = 0;
    for @people -> $person {
        $total += $person.age;
    }
    return $total / @people.elems;
}

# Create a list of Person objects
my @people = ($person1, $person2);

# Call the calculate_average_age subroutine and print the result
say "Average age: " ~ calculate_average_age(@people); # Average age: 27.5
