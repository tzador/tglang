# Example code snippet in Raku

my @numbers = 1..10;           # declare an array with values from 1 to 10
for @numbers.elems -> $i {     # loop through each element of the array
    if $i %% 2 == 0 {          # check if the element is even
        say "$i is an even number.";    # print the element if it is even
    } else {
        say "$i is an odd number.";     # print the element if it is odd
    }
}
