# This program utilizes Raku's built-in methods and subroutines to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle

# define variables for the lengths of the two sides of the triangle
my $side_a = 3;
my $side_b = 4;

# calculate the square of each side using the built-in square method
my $sqr_a = $side_a ** 2;
my $sqr_b = $side_b ** 2;

# calculate the sum of the squares using the built-in add method
my $sum_sqr = $sqr_a.add($sqr_b);

# calculate the square root of the sum using the built-in sqrt method
my $hypotenuse = $sum_sqr.sqrt();

# print the calculated hypotenuse to the console using the built-in say subroutine
say "The hypotenuse of the right triangle with side lengths $side_a and $side_b is $hypotenuse.";
