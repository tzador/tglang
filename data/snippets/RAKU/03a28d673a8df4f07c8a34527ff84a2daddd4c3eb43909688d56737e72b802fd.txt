# This program finds the sum of all even numbers less than or equal to a given number
# Initialize a variable to store the sum
my $sum = 0;
# Get input from user
my $n = prompt "Enter a positive number: ";
# Use a loop to iterate through all numbers less than or equal to the given number
for my $i (1..$n) {
    # Check if number is even
    if $i %% 2 {
        # If even, add to the sum variable
        $sum += $i;
    }
}
# Print the sum of all even numbers
say "The sum of all even numbers is: $sum";
