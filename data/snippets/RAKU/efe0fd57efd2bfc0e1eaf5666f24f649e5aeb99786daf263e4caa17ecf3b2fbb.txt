# This code snippet takes in a list of strings and checks if they are palindromes

# Define sub to check if a word is a palindrome
sub is_palindrome(Str $word) {
    # Convert the word to lowercase and remove any non-alphabetic characters
    my $clean_word = $word.lc.comb(/\w+/).join('');

    # Reverse the word and compare it to the original
    return $clean_word eq $clean_word.flip;
}

# Define an array of words to test
my @words = ('radar', 'level', 'kayak', 'code', 'racecar');

# Loop through the array and print whether each word is a palindrome or not
for @words -> $word {
    if is_palindrome($word) {
        say "$word is a palindrome.";
    }
    else {
        say "$word is not a palindrome.";
    }
}

# Output:
# radar is a palindrome.
# level is a palindrome.
# kayak is a palindrome.
# code is not a palindrome.
# racecar is a palindrome.
