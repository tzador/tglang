# This code snippet uses a for loop and conditionals to check for prime numbers between 2 and 100
for 2..100 -> $num { # use for loop to iterate through numbers
    my $prime = True; # initialize flag variable
    for 2 .. $num/2 -> $i { # iterate through numbers up to half of current number
        if $num % $i == 0 {  # use conditionals to check for factors
            $prime = False;  # if factor is found, change flag variable
            last;  # break out of inner loop
        }
    }
    if $prime { # check final flag variable, if true
        say "$num is a prime number."; # output prime number
    }
