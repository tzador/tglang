# This code snippet takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array with
# only the even numbers, using functional programming style

my @input = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);

# function that checks if a number is even
my $is-even = -> $num { $num %% 2 == 0 };

# filter the input array using the is-even function
# and return the resulting array
my @output = @input.grep: $is-even;

# print out the result
say @output; # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
