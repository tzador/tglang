=head1 DESCRIPTION  # describe the code snippet

This code snippet calculates the total price of items in a grocery list and prints the individual items and their prices. It uses a hash to store the items and their prices, and a for loop to iterate through the hash and calculate the total price. The final total and each item's information is then printed.
