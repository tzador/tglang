# Defining a subroutine 'check_prime' that takes in a number as its parameter
sub check_prime($num) {
    my $flag = 1; # initialize flag variable to 1
    # Checking if the given number is divisible by any number between 2 and half of its value
    for my $i (2..($num / 2)) {
        # If the number is divisible by any number, set flag to 0 and break out of loop
        if $num % $i == 0 {
            $flag = 0;
            last;
        }
    }
    # If flag is still 1, then the number is prime
    if $flag == 1 {
        say "$num is a prime number.";
    } else {
        say "$num is not a prime number.";
    }
}

# Calling the 'check_prime' subroutine with a user-inputted number
