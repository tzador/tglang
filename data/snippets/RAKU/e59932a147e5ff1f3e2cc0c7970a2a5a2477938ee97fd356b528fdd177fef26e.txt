# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number

sub factorial(Int $n) {      # sub routine to calculate factorial, takes an Int as input
    if $n <= 1 {             # base case
        return 1;            # factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
    }
    else {                   # recursive case
        return $n * factorial($n-1);  # multiply the number with the factorial of the previous number
    }
}

say factorial(6);  # prints the factorial of 6

# Output: 720
