## This code snippet is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list

sub sum_of_even_numbers(@list_of_numbers) {
    my $sum = 0; // initializing a variable to store the sum
    for @list_of_numbers -> $number {
        $sum += $number if $number % 2 == 0; // checking if the number is even and adding it to the sum if it is
    }
    return $sum; // returning the final sum
}

# Example usage
say sum_of_even_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // Output: 6 (2 + 4)
my @numbers = (10, 23, 8, 17, 6);
say sum_of_even_numbers(@numbers); // Output: 24 (10 + 8 + 6)
