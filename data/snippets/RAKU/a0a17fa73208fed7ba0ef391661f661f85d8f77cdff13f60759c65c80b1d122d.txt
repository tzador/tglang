# This is a sample code snippet in RAKU
multi sub fibonacci(Int $n) {
    return 0 if $n == 0;

    return fibonacci($n - 1) + fibonacci($n - 2);
}

# This is a recursive function that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number 
# by adding the two previous Fibonacci numbers
fibonacci(10);  # returns 55

# This is an example of using multi subs in RAKU
multi sub add(Int $a, Int $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}

multi sub add(Str $a, Str $b) {
    return "{ $a $b }";

# This will call the second multi sub since the arguments are strings
add("Hello", "World");  # returns "Hello World"

# This is a simple class in RAKU with two attributes and a method

        say "My name is $!name and I am $!age years old.";
    }
}

my $person = Person.new(name => "John", age => 30); # creating a new instance of Person
$person.say(); # says "My name is John and I am 30 years old."
