# This code snippet takes in an array of numbers and
# calculates the average using a user-defined function.

# Define the subroutine to calculate average
sub calculate_average(@input_array) {

    # Initialize variables for sum and count
    my $sum = 0;
    my $count = @input_array.elems;

    # Loop through the array and add each element to sum
    for @input_array -> $element {
        $sum += $element;
    }

    # Calculate the average and return it
    my $average = $sum / $count;
    return $average;
}

# Define the input array
my @numbers = (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40);

# Call the calculate_average subroutine and store the result in a variable
my $result = calculate_average(@numbers);

# Print the result
say "The average is: $result";

# Output:
# The average is: 22.5
