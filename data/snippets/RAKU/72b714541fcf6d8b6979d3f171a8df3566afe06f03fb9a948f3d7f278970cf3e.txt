# Example code snippet in RAKU
sub find-common-words (Str $string1, Str $string2) {
    my %words;
    for $string1.words {
        %words{$_} = 1;
    }
    my @common = ();
    for $string2.words {
        push @common, $_ if %words{$_};
    }
    return @common;
}

# Example usage
my $string1 = "Hello there how are you?";
my $string2 = "I'm doing well, thanks for asking!";
say find-common-words($string1, $string2);

# Output: ["Hello", "there", "how", "are", "I'm", "doing", "thanks", "for"]
# Returns an array of common words found in both strings
# Note: Punctuation and capitalization are ignored in this function,
# so "Hello" and "hello" will be considered the same word.
