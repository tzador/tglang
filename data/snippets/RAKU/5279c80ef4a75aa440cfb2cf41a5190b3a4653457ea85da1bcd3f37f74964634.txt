# This is a complex code snippet in Raku
constant @LIST = 1..10; # defining constant list with numbers 1 to 10
my $sum = 0; # initializing variable for sum
for @LIST -> $e { # looping through the list
    given $e { # using a switch statement
        when * % 2 == 0 { # checking if element is even
            $sum += $e; # adding even element to sum
        }
