# This program calculates the area of a triangle

sub triangle-area($base, $height) { # defines a subroutine that takes in two parameters
    return 0.5 * $base * $height; # calculates the area of a triangle and returns the value
}

my $base = 10; # initializes the base of the triangle
my $height = 5; # initializes the height of the triangle

my $area = triangle-area($base, $height); # calls the triangle-area subroutine and assigns the return value to $area

say "The area of the triangle with a base of $base and a height of $height is $area."; # prints the result

# Output: The area of the triangle with a base of 10 and a height of 5 is 25.
