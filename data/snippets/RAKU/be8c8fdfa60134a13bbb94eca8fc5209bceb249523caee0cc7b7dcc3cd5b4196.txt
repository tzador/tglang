# This is a code snippet in Raku, also known as Perl 6.
# It generates a random string of 10 characters using the .pick operator.

my @chars = <A..Z a..z 0..9>; # creates an array of characters to choose from
my $str = @chars.pick(10).join; # picks 10 characters randomly and joins them into a string
say $str; # prints the generated string
