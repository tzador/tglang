# This code snippet is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all numbers in the list
# raku does not have a built-in sum function, so we create our own
sub sum(@list) {

    # initialize a variable to store the sum
    my $sum = 0;

    # loop through the list using a for loop
    for @list -> $num {

        # add the current number to the sum
        $sum += $num;
    }

    # return the sum
    return $sum;
}

# example usage: 
say sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); # outputs 15
say sum(10, 20, 30); # outputs 60
