# This code snippet creates a class called 'Person' with attributes 'name' and 'age'
class Person {

    # attribute 'name'
    has $.name;

    # attribute 'age'
    has $.age;

    # method to greet the person
    method say-hello () {
        say "Hello, my name is {$.name} and I am {$.age} years old.";
    }

    # method to check if the person is an adult (age > 18)
    method is-adult () {
        if $.age > 18 {
            return True;
        }
        else {
            return False;
        }
    }
}

### Now, let's create an instance of the class 'Person' and call its methods.

# create an instance with name 'John' and age 25
my $john = Person.new( name => 'John', age => 25 );

# print the person's name
$john.name;

# print the person's age
$john.age;

# call the say-hello method to greet the person
$john.say-hello();

# check if the person is an adult and print the result
$john.is-adult();
