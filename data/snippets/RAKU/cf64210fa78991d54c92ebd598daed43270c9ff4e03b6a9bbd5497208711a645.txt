# This code snippet uses a recursive function to find the factorial of a number in Raku

# Declare a sub-routine named 'factorial' that takes in a number as input parameter
sub factorial($n) {

    # Check if the input number is equal to 0 or 1
    if $n == 0 || $n == 1 {

        # If true, return 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
        return 1;
    }
    else {

        # If false, recursively call the 'factorial' function with $n-1 as input
        # This will keep calling the function while decrementing $n until it reaches 1
        # Example: n = 3
        # factorial(3) will call factorial(2) which will call factorial(1) and return 1
        return $n * factorial($n-1);
    }
}

# Prompt the user to enter a number
my $number = prompt "Enter a number: ";

# Call the 'factorial' function passing in the user input as argument
my $result = factorial($number);

# Print out the result
say "The factorial of $number is $result.";
