`Written in RAKU programming language, this code snippet defines an array containing the values 1 to 10 and uses a for loop to iterate through the array. Inside the loop, an if statement checks if the current element is even using the modulus operator and prints a statement regarding its even or odd status. The output of this code would be a list of numbers and their corresponding even or odd status.`
