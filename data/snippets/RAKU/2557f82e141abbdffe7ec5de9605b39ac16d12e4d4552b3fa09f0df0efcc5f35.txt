# This is a complex code snippet in Raku that uses many features and functions.
# It creates a Fibonacci sequence by inputting the first two numbers and the length.

my @fibonacci = fib(1, 1, 10); # Calling the 'fib' function with initial values of 1 and a sequence length of 10.

sub fib($start1, $start2, $length) { # Defining the 'fib' subroutine that takes in start values and the length of the sequence.
    my @fib_seq = (); # Initializing an empty array to store the Fibonacci sequence.

    push @fib_seq, $start1; # Pushing the first start value into the array.
    push @fib_seq, $start2; # Pushing the second start value into the array.

    for 2..($length - 1) { # Using a for loop to loop through the remaining elements in the sequence.
        my $next = @fib_seq[-1] + @fib_seq[-2]; # Calculating the next Fibonacci number by adding the last two numbers.
        push @fib_seq, $next; # Pushing the next number into the array.
    }

    return @fib_seq; # Returning the completed Fibonacci sequence.
}

say @fibonacci; # Printing the generated Fibonacci sequence.
