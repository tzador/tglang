# this is a code snippet in Raku, also known as Perl 6 

# define a multi sub called "greet" that takes in a single parameter 'name'
multi sub greet (Str $name) {

    # declare a variable $message containing a string
    my $message = "Hello, $name!";

    # print the message to the console
    say $message;
}

# call the greet multi sub with an argument "John"
greet("John");

# output: Hello, John!
