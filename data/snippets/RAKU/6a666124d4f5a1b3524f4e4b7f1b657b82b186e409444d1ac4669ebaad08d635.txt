# Prototype function `divide` which takes in any number of arguments
# and returns a Rat (rational number).
# There are two multi subroutines under this prototype - one to divide
# two given numbers and the other to return an error when trying to divide
# by 0.
# This illustrates the use of multiple dispatch - where the appropriate subroutine
# is chosen based on the number and type of arguments passed in.
