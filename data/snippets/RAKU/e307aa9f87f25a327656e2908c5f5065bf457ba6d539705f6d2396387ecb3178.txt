# This code snippet sorts a list of integers using the bubble sort algorithm.

# Define a subroutine to perform bubble sort on a given list.
sub bubble-sort (@list) {

    # Set a flag to keep track of whether any swaps were made in the current iteration.
    my $swapped = True;

    # Use a while loop to continue iterating until no swaps are made.
    while $swapped {

        # Reset the flag to false at the beginning of each iteration.
        $swapped = False;

        # Use a for loop to go through each element in the list.
        for ^@list.elems - 1 -> $i {

            # If the current element is larger than the next element, swap them.
            if @list[$i] > @list[$i + 1] {

                # Use the .swap method to swap the two elements.
                @list[$i + 1], @list[$i] = @list[$i], @list[$i + 1];

                # Set the flag to true since a swap was made.
                $swapped = True;
            }
        }
    }
}

# Define a list of integers to be sorted.
my @list = (5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3);

# Call the bubble-sort subroutine on the list.
bubble-sort(@list);

# Print the sorted list as output.
say @list;

# Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
