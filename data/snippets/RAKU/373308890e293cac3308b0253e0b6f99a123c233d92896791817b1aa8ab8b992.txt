# This code demonstrates a complex algorithm for calculating the fibonacci sequence using Raku

# Define a subroutine to calculate the nth term in the fibonacci sequence
sub fibonacci(Int $n)
{
    # Check for base cases 
    return $n if $n < 2;
    
    # Recursive calls to calculate previous terms
    my $term1 = fibonacci($n - 1);
    my $term2 = fibonacci($n - 2);

    # Return the sum of previous two terms
    return $term1 + $term2;
}

# Create a loop to print the first 10 terms of the fibonacci sequence
for 1..10 -> $i 
{
    # Call the fibonacci subroutine and print the result
    my $result = fibonacci($i);
    print "$result ";
}
