# This code snippet uses a for loop to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number

my $n = 10; # set the limit for the Fibonacci sequence
my $a = 0; # initialize the first number in the sequence as 0
my $b = 1; # initialize the second number in the sequence as 1

# use a for loop to iterate through the numbers up to the limit
for ^$n -> $i {
    say $a; # print the current number in the sequence
    my $temp = $a + $b; # calculate the next number in the sequence
    $a = $b; # update the first number as the previous second number
    $b = $temp; # update the second number as the calculated next number
}
