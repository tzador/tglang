# This snippet uses an array to create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
my @numbers = 1..10; # create an array with values from 1 to 10
my @squared_numbers = map {$_ ** 2}, @numbers; # use the "map" function to square each number in the array
my $sum = 0; # initialize a variable to store the sum
for @squared_numbers -> $number { # use a "for" loop to iterate through each number in the array
    $sum += $number; # add each number to the sum variable
}
say "The sum of squared numbers from 1 to 10 is {$sum}."; # print the sum of squared numbers
