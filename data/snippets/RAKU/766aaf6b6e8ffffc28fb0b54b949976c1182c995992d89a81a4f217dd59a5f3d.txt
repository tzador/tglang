# This is a code snippet in RAKU for generating a random number within a given range.

# Declare variables for range and random number
my $min = 0; # lowest possible number in range
my $max = 10; # highest possible number in range
my $random_number;

# Generate a random number using Raku's built-in rand function
$random_number = $min + int(rand($max - $min + 1)); # add $min to ensure the random number falls within the given range

# Print the randomly generated number
say "Random number within range of $min and $max is $random_number";
