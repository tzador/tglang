# Example code snippet in RAKU
my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); # Create an array of numbers
my $sum = 0; # Initialize a variable to store the sum of the numbers
for @numbers -> $number { # Iterate through the numbers in the array
    if $number %% 2 == 0 { # Check if the number is even
        $sum += $number; # Add the number to the sum
    }
}
say $sum; # Print the sum of the even numbers (6)
