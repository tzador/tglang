# This code snippet demonstrates the use of a closure to calculate the factorial of a given number.

{
    my $num = shift;  # Assign the given number to a variable

    if $num == 0 {
        return 1;  # Return 1 if the number is 0
    }
    else {
        return $num * recurse($num - 1);  # Call the closure recursively to calculate the factorial
    }
} # End of closure

say recurse(5);  # Output: 120, since 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
