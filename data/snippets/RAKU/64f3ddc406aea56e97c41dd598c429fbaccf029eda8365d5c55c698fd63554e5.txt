# This code snippet creates a class representing a student with properties for their name, age, and grade
class Student {

    has Str $.name; # property for storing student's name
    has Int $.age; # property for storing student's age
    has Int $.grade; # property for storing student's grade

    method new(Str $name, Int $age, Int $grade) { # constructor method with parameters for initializing properties
        self.bless(*, :$name, :$age, :$grade); # bless method sets the values of the properties
    }

    method update_grade(Int $new_grade) { # method for updating the student's grade
        $!grade = $new_grade; # assign new grade to the property
        say "Updated $!name's grade to $new_grade"; # print confirmation message
    }

    method celebrate_birthday() { # method for increasing student's age by 1
        $!age++; # increment age property
        say "$!name turned $!age years old! Happy birthday! ðŸŽ‰"; # print birthday message
    }
}

# instantiate a new Student object with name, age, and grade parameters
my $student = Student.new("Jane", 15, 9);

# update the student's grade to 10
$student.update_grade(10);

# call the birthday method to celebrate the student's birthday
$student.celebrate_birthday();

# OUTPUT: Updated Jane's grade to 10
# Jane turned 16 years old! Happy birthday! ðŸŽ‰
