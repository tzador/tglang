#This is a complex code snippet that prints out the sum of the squares of numbers in a given array

#Define the array
my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

#Create a subroutine to calculate the square of a number
sub square($num) {
    my $result = $num ** 2; #Use the exponent operator to square the number
    return $result; #Return the squared value
}

#Initialize a variable to store the sum of squares
my $sum = 0;

#Create a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the sum of squares
for @numbers -> $num {
    $sum += square($num); #Call the square subroutine to calculate the square and add it to the sum variable
}

#Print the result using an interpolated string
print "The sum of squares of the numbers in the array is: $sum";
