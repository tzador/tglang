# This is a simple Raku program that creates a class and uses it to instantiate an object

# Define a class called Person
class Person {
    has $.name;    # This creates a class attribute called 'name' with the type specified as '$' (string)
    has $.age;    # This creates a class attribute called 'age' with the type specified as '$' (string)
    has $.gender;    # This creates a class attribute called 'gender' with the type specified as '$' (string)

    # Create a method to print out the person's information
    method info {
        say "Name: { $!name }";
        say "Age: { $!age }";
        say "Gender: { $!gender }";
    }
}

# Instantiate an object of the Person class
my $person = Person.new(name => "John", age => "27", gender => "Male");

# Call the info method on the object to print out the person's information
$person.info();

# Output:
# Name: John
# Age: 27
# Gender: Male
