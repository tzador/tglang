# This is a complex code snippet in Raku

my @list = <1 2 3 4 5>; # defining a list using the range operator '<>'
my $sum = 0;

for @list -> $num {    # using a for loop to loop through the list
    $sum += $num;      # adding each element in the list to the sum variable
}

my $average = $sum / @list.elems; # calculating the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list
say "Average is $average";        # printing the average to the console

# Output: Average is 3

my $squared_sum = 0;
for @list -> $num {
    $squared_sum += $num**2;   # using the exponent operator '**' to square each element in the list before adding it to the sum
}

my $std_deviation = sqrt( ($squared_sum / @list.elems) - ($average)**2 ); # calculating the standard deviation using the formula sqrt((sum of squared values / number of elements) - (average squared))
say "Standard Deviation is $std_deviation";        # printing the standard deviation to the console

# Output: Standard Deviation is 1.5811388300841898
