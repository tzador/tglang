# This code snippet uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number
# Function definition
sub factorial (Int $n) {
    # Base case
    return 1 if $n == 0;

    # Recursive case
    return $n * factorial($n - 1);
}

# Taking input from user
my $number = prompt("Enter a number: ");

# Converting user input to integer
my $num = $number.Int;

# Calling the recursive function and storing the result in a variable
my $result = factorial($num);

# Printing the result
say "The factorial of $number is $result";
