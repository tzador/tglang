# This program uses the Raku programming language to sort a list of numbers
my @numbers = <5 3 7 9 1 8 2>; # create an array of numbers to sort
my @sorted = sort {$^a <=> $^b}, @numbers; # use the sort function with a custom comparison block
say "Sorted numbers: {@sorted.join(' ')}"; # output the sorted list
