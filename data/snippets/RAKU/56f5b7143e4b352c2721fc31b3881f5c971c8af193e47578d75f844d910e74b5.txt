# This code snippet creates a subroutine to calculate the volume of a cube using a given side length
sub calc_volume($side_length) {

    # Multiply side length by itself three times to get volume
    my $volume = $side_length ** 3;

    # Print the calculated volume
    say "The volume of the cube with a side length of $side_length is $volume";
}

# Call the subroutine with a side length of 5
calc_volume(5);

# Output:
# "The volume of the cube with a side length of 5 is 125"
