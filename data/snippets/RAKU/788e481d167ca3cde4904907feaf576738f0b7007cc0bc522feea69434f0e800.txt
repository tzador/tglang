# Define a multi sub for calculating the area of a square
multi sub area (Int $side) {
    return $side ** 2;  # square the length of the side
}

# Define a multi sub for calculating the area of a rectangle
multi sub area (Int $length, Int $width) {
    return $length * $width;
}

# Define a multi sub for calculating the area of a triangle
multi sub area (Int $base, Int $height) {
    return ($base * $height) / 2;  # divide by 2 for triangle
}

# Call the area subs using key value pairs
say "The area of a square with side length 5 is " ~ area(side => 5);
say "The area of a rectangle with length 3 and width 5 is " ~ area(length => 3, width => 5);
say "The area of a triangle with base 4 and height 6 is " ~ area(base => 4, height => 6);

# OUTPUT:
# The area of a square with side length 5 is 25
# The area of a rectangle with length 3 and width 5 is 15
# The area of a triangle with base 4 and height 6 is 12
