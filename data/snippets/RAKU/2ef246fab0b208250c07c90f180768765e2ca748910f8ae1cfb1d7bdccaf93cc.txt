# This is a program in Raku that calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user

# Function to calculate the factorial of a number
sub factorial($n) {

    # Variable to store the result
    my $fact = 1;

    # Loop to iterate from 1 to the given number
    for (1..$n) {

        # Multiplying the current number with the factorial
        $fact *= $_;
    }

    # Returning the factorial
    return $fact;
}

# Getting user input for the number
my $num = prompt("Enter a number: ");

# Function call to calculate the factorial
my $result = factorial($num);

# Printing the result
say "Factorial of $num is $result";
