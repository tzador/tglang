# Annotated Raku code snippet

# Declare a hash variable with key-value pairs
my %personal_info = (
    name => "John Smith",
    age => 32,
    address => "123 Main St",
    phone_number => "555-555-5555"
);

# Declare a list of programming languages
my @programming_languages = <Raku Java Python C++>;

# Define a subroutine to calculate the square of a given number
sub square (Int $number) {
    return $number ** 2;
}

# Use a for loop to iterate through the list of programming languages
for @programming_languages -> $lang {
    say "Hello from $lang!";
}

# Use the square subroutine to calculate the age squared
my $age_squared = square(%personal_info{"age"});

# Print the result
say "My age squared is $age_squared";
