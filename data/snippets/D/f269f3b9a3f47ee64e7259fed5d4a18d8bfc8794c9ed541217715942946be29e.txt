/**
 * This is a complex code snippet in the D Programming Language that utilizes
 * a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
 */

//Define a factorial function that takes in a positive integer
uint factorial(int num) {

    //Base case: if num is equal to 0, return 1
    if (num == 0) {
        return 1;
    }

    //Recursive case: multiply num by the factorial of num-1
    return num * factorial(num - 1);
}

//Get user input for the number to calculate factorial for
int num;
write("Enter a positive integer: ");
readf("%d", &num);

//Check if number is positive
if (num < 0) {
    writefln("Error: Number must be positive.");
}
else {
    //Calculate and print the factorial using the factorial function
    writefln("%d! = %d", num, factorial(num));
}

//Example input and output:
//Input: 5
//Output: 5! = 120
