//This code snippet is a bubble sort algorithm in D Programming Language.
//First, we declare a function that takes in an array of integers as a parameter.
void bubbleSort(int[] arr){
    //Next, we declare two variables, one to hold the temp value and another for looping through the array.
    int temp;
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++){
        for (j = 0; j < arr.length - i - 1; j++){
            //Here, we compare the current element with the next element in the array.
            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]){
                //If the current element is greater than the next element, we swap their positions using the temp variable.
                temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                arr[j+1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
    //Finally, we output the sorted array.
    writeln(arr);
}
//Sample Input:  [5, 2, 1, 3, 4]
//Expected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
