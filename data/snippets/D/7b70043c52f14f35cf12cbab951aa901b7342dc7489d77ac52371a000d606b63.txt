/* This is a complex code snippet in D Programming Language */
/* It involves creating a struct, a class and implementing various functions */

// Define a struct with two variables
struct Employee{
    string name;
    int age;
}

// Define a class which inherits from Employee struct
class Manager : Employee{
    // This class has an additional variable for salary
    int salary;
    
    // Constructor which takes in name, age and salary for Manager
    this(string name, int age, int salary){
        // Call to base class constructor with name and age
        super(name, age);
        // Assigning salary variable
        this.salary = salary;
    }
    
    // Function to raise salary of Manager
    void raiseSalary(int amount){
        this.salary += amount;
    }
}

// Function to print details of Employee object
void printEmployee(Employee emp){
    // Printing name and age of Employee
    writeln("Employee name: ", emp.name);
    writeln("Employee age: ", emp.age);
}

// Create an object of class Manager
auto manager = new Manager("John", 35, 80000);

// Print details of manager
printEmployee(manager);

// Raise manager's salary by 5000
manager.raiseSalary(5000);

// Print updated salary
writeln("Manager's updated salary: ", manager.salary);
