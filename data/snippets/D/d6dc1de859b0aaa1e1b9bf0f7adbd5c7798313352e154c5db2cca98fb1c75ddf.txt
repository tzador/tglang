//Create a struct with two properties: x and y
struct Point {
    int x;
    immutable int y; //immutable keyword makes the property read-only
}

//Create a function that takes two Point objects and calculates the distance between them
double distance(Point p1, immutable Point p2) {
    double dx = p2.x - p1.x;
    double dy = p2.y - p1.y;
    return sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy); //sqrt function calculates the square root
}

//Create an array of Point objects
Point[] points = [
    Point(0,0),
    Point(3, 4),
    Point(6, 8)
];

//Print out the distance between the first and last point in the array
writeln(distance(points[0], points[$-1])); //$-1 returns the index of the last element in the array
