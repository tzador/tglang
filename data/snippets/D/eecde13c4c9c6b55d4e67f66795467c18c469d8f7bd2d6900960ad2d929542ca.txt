//This code snippet is a function that implements the insertion sort algorithm in D programming language
//It takes in an array of integers and sorts them in ascending order

void insertionSort(int[] arr)
{
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++)
    {
        int key = arr[i];
        int j = i - 1;

        // Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
        // greater than key, to one position ahead
        // of their current position
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key)
        {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
}

//Example of calling the function with an array of integers
int[] array = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1];
insertionSort(array);

//Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8] 
//The array has been sorted in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm
