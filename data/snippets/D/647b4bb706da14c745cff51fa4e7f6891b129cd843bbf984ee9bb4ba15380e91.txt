//This code snippet creates a class called "Person" with various properties and methods
class Person {
    //Properties:
    //string to store person's name
    string name;
    //int to store person's age
    int age;
    //string to store person's occupation

    }
    
    //Static method to print out a greeting
    static void greet() {
        writefln("Hello there!");
    }
}

//Create a new instance of Person
Person john = new Person("John", 26, "Software Engineer");

//Call the printDetails method on john
john.printDetails();

//Call the isAdult method on john and assign the result to a variable
bool isJohnAdult = john.isAdult();

//Print out a greeting using the static greet method
Person.greet();

//Output:
/*
