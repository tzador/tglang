// Define a struct called Person with two properties: name (string) and age (integer)
struct Person
{
    string name;
    int age;
}

// Create an array of Person
Person[] people;

// Instantiate three Person objects with different names and ages, and add them to the array
people ~= Person("John", 25);
people ~= Person("Emily", 29);
people ~= Person("Michael", 32);

// Sort the array by age in descending order
people.sort!( (a,b) => a.age > b.age );

// Print out the names and ages of the people in the array
foreach(person; people)
{
    writeln("Name: ", person.name, ", Age: ", person.age);
}

// Output:
// Name: Michael, Age: 32
// Name: Emily, Age: 29
// Name: John, Age: 25
