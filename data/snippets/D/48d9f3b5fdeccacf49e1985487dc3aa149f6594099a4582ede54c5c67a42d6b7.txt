//This code snippet calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive function
//First, we define the function fibonacci that takes in a positive integer and returns an integer
int fibonacci(int n)
{
  //Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return n
  if(n == 0 || n == 1)
    return n;
  
  //Otherwise, recursively call the function with n-1 and n-2, and add their respective return values
  return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}

//Define a variable to store the desired term in the sequence
int term = 10;

//Call the fibonacci function with the desired term
int result = fibonacci(term);

//Output the result to the console
writeln("The " ~ term ~ "th term in the Fibonacci sequence is " ~ result);
