/**
 * This is a complex code snippet in D Programming Language that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
 * To calculate the factorial of a number, we multiply all numbers from 1 to the given number.
 * For example, the factorial of 5 (5!) is 1*2*3*4*5 = 120.

// Define a function called "factorial" that takes in an integer as an argument
// and returns an integer as the result
int factorial(int num) {

    // Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    if (num == 0) {
        return 1;
    }

    // Recursive case: multiply the given number by the factorial of the number minus 1
    // until we reach the base case
    return num * factorial(num - 1);
}

// Prompt the user for input
writeln("Enter a number:");

// Take in user input as a string and convert it to an integer
int num = readln().to!int;

// Call the factorial function and assign the result to a variable
int result = factorial(num);

// Print the result to the console
writeln("The factorial of " ~ to!string(num) ~ " is " ~ to!string(result));
