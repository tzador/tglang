// This program uses structs and arrays to store and manipulate data

// Define a struct for a person
struct Person
{
    string name;
    int age;
    char gender;
}

// Define an array of Person objects
Person[10] people;

// Populate the array with data
people[0] = Person("John", 25, 'M');
people[1] = Person("Sarah", 22, 'F');
people[2] = Person("Bob", 31, 'M');
people[3] = Person("Samantha", 28, 'F');
people[4] = Person("Mike", 29, 'M');
people[5] = Person("Emily", 24, 'F');
people[6] = Person("Justin", 27, 'M');
people[7] = Person("Rachel", 26, 'F');
people[8] = Person("David", 30, 'M');
people[9] = Person("Lily", 23, 'F');

// Calculate the average age of the group
int totalAge = 0;

foreach(person; people)
{
    totalAge += person.age;
}

float averageAge = totalAge / people.length;

// Print out the results
writeln("The average age of the group is: ", averageAge);
writeln("The names and genders of all the people in the group are:");

// Loop through the array again to print out each person's name and gender
foreach(person; people)
{
    writeln(person.name, " is a ", (person.gender == 'M' ? "male" : "female"));
}

// Output:
// The average age of the group is: 26.5
// The names and genders of all the people in the group are:
// John is a male
// Sarah is a female
// Bob is a male
// Samantha is a female
// Mike is a male
// Emily is a female
// Justin is a male
// Rachel is a female
// David is a male
// Lily is a female
