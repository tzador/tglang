// This code snippet demonstrates how to implement a recursive factorial function in D Programming Language.

// Define a function named `factorial` that takes an integer `n` as its input and returns an integer as its output.
int factorial(int n)
{
    // Use a conditional statement to handle the base case of n equaling 1.
    if (n == 1)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    // Use recursion to calculate the factorial of `n` by calling `factorial` with `n-1` as its argument.
    else
    {
        return n * factorial(n-1);
    }
}

// Define a variable `num` and assign it the value of 5.
int num = 5;

// Call the `factorial` function with `num` as its argument and store the output in a variable named `result`.
int result = factorial(num);

// Print the result to the console.
writeln(result);
