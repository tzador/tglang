-- This script flips a coin and prints the result

-- First, define a list of possible outcomes
set outcomes to {"Heads", "Tails"}

-- Use the `choose from list` command to randomly select an outcome
set selectedOutcome to (choose from list outcomes)

-- Use the `display dialog` command to show the result to the user
display dialog "You got " & selectedOutcome & "!"

-- For added complexity, store the total number of outcomes and create a loop to flip the coin multiple times
set totalOutcomes to count of outcomes
set flipCount to 0
set headsCount to 0
set tailsCount to 0

repeat totalOutcomes times
	set flipCount to flipCount + 1
	
	-- Randomly select an outcome index between 1 and the total number of outcomes
	set randomIndex to random number from 1 to totalOutcomes
	
	-- Use the selected index to get the corresponding outcome from the list
	set selectedOutcome to item randomIndex of outcomes
	
	-- Add to the count for the corresponding outcome
	if selectedOutcome is equal to "Heads" then
		set headsCount to headsCount + 1
	else
		set tailsCount to tailsCount + 1
	end if
end repeat

-- Use the `display dialog` command to show the result to the user
display dialog "After flipping the coin " & flipCount & " times, you got " & headsCount & " heads and " & tailsCount & " tails!"
