-- Code snippet that counts the number of words in a given string
on countWords(myText)
	set counter to 0 -- initialize counter variable
	set spaceChar to ASCII character 32 -- set space character
	set letterList to every character of myText -- separate each character into a list
	repeat with letter in letterList -- loop through each letter in the list
		if (letter as ASCII character) = spaceChar then -- check if the letter is equal to space character
			set counter to counter + 1 -- increment counter if a space is found
		end if
	end repeat
	set wordCount to counter + 1 -- add one to the counter to account for the first word
	return wordCount -- return the final word count
end countWords

-- Example usage
set textToCount to "This is a sample sentence." -- example sentence
set wordCount to countWords(textToCount) -- call the countWords function and pass in the given sentence
Log wordCount -- output the result to the console using the Log command
