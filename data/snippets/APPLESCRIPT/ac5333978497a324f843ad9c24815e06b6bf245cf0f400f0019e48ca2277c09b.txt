-- This code snippet is a simple calculator
on calc(num1, num2, operation)
	set result to 0
	if operation = "add" then
		set result to num1 + num2
	else if operation = "subtract" then
		set result to num1 - num2
	else if operation = "multiply" then
		set result to num1 * num2
	else if operation = "divide" then
		set result to num1 / num2
	end if
	return result
end calc

-- Now we can use this function to perform calculations
set addition to calc(5, 10, "add") -- assigns the result of adding 5 and 10 to the variable addition
set subtraction to calc(8, 3, "subtract") -- assigns the result of subtracting 3 from 8 to the variable subtraction
set multiplication to calc(6, 9, "multiply") -- assigns the result of multiplying 6 and 9 to the variable multiplication
set division to calc(20, 4, "divide") -- assigns the result of dividing 20 by 4 to the variable division

-- Output the results of the calculations
display dialog "The result of 5 + 10 is " & addition -- displays a dialogue box with the result of 5 + 10
display dialog "The result of 8 - 3 is " & subtraction -- displays a dialogue box with the result of 8 - 3
display dialog "The result of 6 * 9 is " & multiplication -- displays a dialogue box with the result of 6 * 9
display dialog "The result of 20 / 4 is " & division -- displays a dialogue box with the result of 20 / 4

-- This code snippet can be easily modified to perform other calculations by adding more conditionals to the calc function.
