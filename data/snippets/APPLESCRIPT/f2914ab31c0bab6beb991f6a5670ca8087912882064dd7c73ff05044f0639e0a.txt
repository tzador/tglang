-- This code snippet demonstrates a complex function in AppleScript

on complexFunction(inputList)
  -- This function takes in a list of integers as input and performs various operations on them
  -- Output: a list of dictionaries containing the input integers and their associated results
  
  -- Variable declaration
  set outputList to {}
  
  -- Loop through input list
  repeat with i from 1 to count of inputList
    -- Get current integer
    set num to item i of inputList
    
    -- Perform mathematical operations on current integer
    set squared to num * num
    set cubed to num * num * num
    
    -- Create dictionary to store results
    set resultDict to {inputNum:num, squared:squared, cubed:cubed}
    
    -- Add dictionary to output list
    set end of outputList to resultDict
  end repeat
  
  -- Return output list
  return outputList
end complexFunction

-- Example input list
set inputList to {5, 8, 10, 3}

-- Call complexFunction and store the results
set resultList to complexFunction(inputList)

-- Print the results
log resultList
