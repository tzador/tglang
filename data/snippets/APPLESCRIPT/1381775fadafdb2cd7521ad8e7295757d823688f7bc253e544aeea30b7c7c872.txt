-- This is a complex code snippet in Applescript
-- It contains a loop and conditional statements

-- First, we define a list of words to loop through
set wordList to {"apple", "bear", "cat", "dog", "elephant"}

-- Next, we define a variable to keep track of the total length of words in the list
set totalLength to 0

-- We will use a `repeat with` loop to go through each word in the list and perform operations on them
repeat with word in wordList

    -- We use an `if` statement to check if the word starts with the letter "a"
    if first character of word is "a" then

        -- If it does, we add the length of the word to our `totalLength` variable
        set totalLength to totalLength + (count of characters of word)

    -- If the word doesn't start with "a", we use an `else if` statement to check if it starts with the letter "b"
    else if first character of word is "b" then

        -- If it does, we use a `repeat until` loop to check if the word contains the letter "e"
        -- This loop will continue until the letter "e" is found or the word ends
        repeat until word contains "e"

            -- We remove the first letter of the word using the `text` command
            set word to text 2 thru -1 of word

        end repeat

        -- Once the letter "e" is found, we add the length of the remaining word to our `totalLength` variable
        set totalLength to totalLength + (count of characters of word)

    -- If the word doesn't start with "a" or "b", we use an `else` statement to add the length of the word to `totalLength` without any manipulation
    else

        set totalLength to totalLength + (count of characters of word)

    end if

end repeat

-- Finally, we display the total length of all words in the list
display dialog "The total length of all words is " & totalLength
