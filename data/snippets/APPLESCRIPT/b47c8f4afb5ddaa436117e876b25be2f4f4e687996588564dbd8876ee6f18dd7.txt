This is a long and complex code snippet written in AppleScript
It will perform various actions and calculations on a set of numbers
and display the results in a message box
*)

-- Define a list of numbers to be used in the calculations
set numberList to {17, 45, 23, 10, 82, 36, 55}

-- Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list
set sum to 0
repeat with i from 1 to count of numberList
	set sum to sum + item i of numberList
end repeat

-- Calculate the average of all the numbers in the list
set average to sum / (count of numberList)

-- Calculate the product of all the numbers in the list
set product to 1
repeat with i from 1 to count of numberList
	set product to product * item i of numberList
end repeat

-- Calculate the maximum and minimum numbers in the list
set max to 0
set min to item 1 of numberList
repeat with i from 1 to count of numberList
	if item i of numberList > max then
		set max to item i of numberList
	end if
	if item i of numberList < min then
		set min to item i of numberList
	end if
end repeat

-- Format the results into a message to be displayed
set message to "The sum of the numbers is " & sum & "." & return & "The average of the numbers is " & average & "." & return & "The product of the numbers is " & product & "." & return & "The maximum number is " & max & "." & return & "The minimum number is " & min & "."

-- Display the message in a dialog box
display dialog message buttons {"OK"} default button "OK" with icon note

-- Output the final message in a formatted way
