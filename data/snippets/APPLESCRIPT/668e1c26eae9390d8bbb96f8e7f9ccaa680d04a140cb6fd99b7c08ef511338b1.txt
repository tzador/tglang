-- This is a code snippet in the AppleScript language.
-- It creates a simple function that counts the number of words in a given string.

on countWords(inputString)
    -- The first step is to split the string into individual words.
    set wordsList to words of inputString
    
    -- We then create a variable to hold the count.
    set wordCount to 0
    
    -- Next, we loop through each word in the list.
    repeat with currentWord in wordsList
        
        -- For each word, we check if it consists of letters only.
        if currentWord contains only letters then
            
            -- If it does, we increase the count by 1.
            set wordCount to wordCount + 1
        end if
    end repeat
    
    -- Finally, we return the count value.
    return wordCount
end countWords

-- We can now call the function and pass in a string to get the word count.
set inputString to "This is a sample string to demonstrate the countWords function"
set result to countWords(inputString)

-- The result will then be printed in the console.
log "The number of words in the input string is " & result
