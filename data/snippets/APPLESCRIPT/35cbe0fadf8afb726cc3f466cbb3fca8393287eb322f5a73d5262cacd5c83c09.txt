(*
This is a complex code snippet that utilizes various features of the AppleScript programming language.
It checks for the presence of a specific file and creates a new text file based on the contents of the existing file.
It also uses a conditional statement and a repeat loop to perform different actions based on the results.

set fileToCheck to "sample.txt" -- file to check for existence
set newFileName to "newSample.txt" -- name for new file to be created
set fileContent to "" -- variable to store contents of file
set fileExists to (exists fileToCheck) -- check if file exists
if not fileExists then -- if file does not exist, display an error message
	display "File does not exist."
else -- if file exists, read contents and perform actions on it
	open for access fileToCheck -- open file for reading
	repeat until eof of fileToCheck -- read the contents of the file and store in variable
		set fileContent to fileContent & (read fileToCheck for 1) as text
	end repeat
	close access fileToCheck -- close file after reading
	set fileToCreate to open for access newFileName with write permission -- create new file
	repeat with i from 1 to count of characters in fileContent -- loop through file contents
		set currentChar to character i of fileContent
		if currentChar is not " " then -- if character is not a space, write to new file
			write currentChar to fileToCreate
		else -- if character is a space, write a new line to new file
			write return to fileToCreate
		end if
	end repeat
	close access fileToCreate -- close new file
end if
(*
The above code snippet checks for the presence of a specific file, reads its contents, and creates a new file based on those contents.
It also handles cases where the file does not exist, displays an error message, and inserts new lines based on spaces in the file's content.
