(* This code snippet generates a random password with customizable length and complexity *)

set passwordLength to 10 (* Set the length of the password, change value as needed *)

(* Set the characters to be used in the password *)
set lowercaseLetters to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
set uppercaseLetters to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
set numbers to "0123456789"
set specialChars to "!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:<>,.?/~`"

(* Concatenate the characters into one string *)
set characters to lowercaseLetters & uppercaseLetters & numbers & specialChars

(* Set up a counter for the loop *)
set i to 1

(* Set an empty string to store the password *)
set password to ""

(* Repeat until the password length is reached *)
repeat passwordLength times
	(* Generate a random number between 1 and the length of the characters string *)
	set randomIndex to (random number from 1 to (length of characters))

	(* Get the character at the random index and add it to the password *)
	set password to password & character randomIndex of characters
  
  (* Increase the counter *)
	set i to i + 1
end repeat

(* Print the randomly generated password *)
log "Random Password: " & password
