(*
This is a long and complex code snippet written in Applescript.
It contains a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
Input:
number - an integer value
Output:
factorial - the factorial of the input number
*)

on factorial(number)
	set factorial to 1
	repeat with i from 1 to number
		set factorial to factorial * i
	end repeat
	return factorial
end factorial

(*
To test the function, we will calculate the factorial of the number 5.
Expected output: 120
*)

set num to 5
set result to factorial(num)
display dialog "The factorial of " & num & " is " & result

(*
This code snippet demonstrates the use of user input in Applescript.
The user will be prompted to enter a number and the factorial of that number will be calculated.
Input:
number - user input value
Output:
factorial - the factorial of the input number
*)

display dialog "Enter a number:" default answer "0"
set input to text returned of result
set inputNum to input as number
set output to factorial(inputNum)
display dialog "The factorial of " & inputNum & " is " & output
