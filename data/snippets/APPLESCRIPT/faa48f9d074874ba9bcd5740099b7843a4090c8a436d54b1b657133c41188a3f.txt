-- This code snippet creates a script that opens a new untitled document in TextEdit and types a message into it 

-- First, we create a new TextEdit document and save it as a variable
tell application "TextEdit"
	set newDoc to make new document
end tell

-- Next, we set the message that we want to type into the document
set message to "Hello there! This is a message typed by an Applescript."

-- Now, we use System Events to activate TextEdit and type the message into the document
tell application "System Events"
	-- activate TextEdit
	keystroke "n" using command down -- press command + n to create a new document
	delay 0.5 -- wait for TextEdit to open the new document
	keystroke message -- type the message into the document
end tell

-- Lastly, we save the document in the Documents folder with a custom name
set docPath to (path to documents folder as text) & "My TextEdit Document.txt"
save newDoc in file docPath
