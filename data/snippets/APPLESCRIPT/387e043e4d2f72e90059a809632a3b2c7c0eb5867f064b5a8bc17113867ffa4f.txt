-- This code snippet is a simple calculator that asks the user for two numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations on them
-- Define a function to get user input for a number
on getNumber()
    set userInput to ""
    repeat until (userInput is number)
        display dialog "Enter a number" default answer ""
        set userInput to text returned of result
        try
            set userInput to userInput as number
        on error
            display dialog "Please enter a valid number" buttons {"OK"} default button 1
            set userInput to ""
        end try
        if userInput is equal to "" then
            set userInput to "Invalid"
        end if
    end repeat
    return userInput
end getNumber

-- Define variables for the two numbers
set num1 to getNumber()
set num2 to getNumber()

-- Prompt user for desired operation
set operationList to {"Add", "Subtract", "Multiply", "Divide"}
set operation to choose from list operationList with prompt "What operation would you like to perform?" default items {"Add"}

-- Perform the specified operation on the two numbers and output the result
if operation is equal to "Add" then
    set result to num1 + num2
else if operation is equal to "Subtract" then
    set result to num1 - num2
else if operation is equal to "Multiply" then
    set result to num1 * num2
else if operation is equal to "Divide" then
    set result to num1 / num2
end if

-- Display the result to the user
display dialog "The result is " & result buttons {"OK"} default button 1
