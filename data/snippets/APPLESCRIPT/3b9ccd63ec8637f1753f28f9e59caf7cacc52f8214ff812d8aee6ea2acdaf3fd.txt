-- this code snippet uses the 'repeat' loop and 'if' statement in APPLESCRIPT

-- sets up a list of numbers
set numbersList to {10, 25, 15, 5, 2, 29}

-- sets counter variable for the loop
set i to 1

-- 'repeat' loop will go through each item in the list
repeat with num in numbersList

	-- 'if' statement checks if the number is divisible by 5
	if num mod 5 = 0 then
		
		-- prints the number and notes that it is divisible by 5
		log "Number " & i & ": " & num & " is divisible by 5"
	
	-- if the number is not divisible by 5, it will print a different message
	else 
		log "Number " & i & ": " & num & " is not divisible by 5"
	end if
	
	-- increments counter variable
	set i to i + 1

end repeat
