-- This code snippet uses Applescript to extract data from a CSV file and export it to a spreadsheet
-- The CSV file contains information about products with their name, price, and quantity
-- The output spreadsheet will have three columns: Name, Price, Quantity

-- Create an empty list to store the data
set productList to {}

-- Open the CSV file
set csvFile to (choose file with prompt "Choose CSV file")

-- Read the file and store each line of data in the list
set fileContents to read csvFile using delimiter ","

-- Loop through each line of data
repeat with i from 2 to count of fileContents
	-- Split the line of data by the delimiter
	set data to the words in item i of fileContents

	-- Create a new record with the data
	set newRecord to {Name:item 1 of data, Price:item 2 of data, Quantity:item 3 of data}

	-- Add the record to the list
	set end of productList to newRecord
end repeat

-- Create a new spreadsheet
tell application "Numbers"
	activate
	set newSpreadsheet to make new document
	set name of newSpreadsheet to "Product List"
	tell newSpreadsheet
		set newTable to make new table with properties {column count:3, row count:count of productList}
		tell newTable
			-- Set the headers for each column
			set value of cell 1 of column 1 to "Name"
			set value of cell 1 of column 2 to "Price"
			set value of cell 1 of column 3 to "Quantity"

			-- Loop through each record in the list and add the data to the correct cell
			repeat with i from 1 to count of productList
				set currentRecord to item i of productList
				set value of cell (i + 1) of column 1 to Name of currentRecord
				set value of cell (i + 1) of column 2 to Price of currentRecord
				set value of cell (i + 1) of column 3 to Quantity of currentRecord
			end repeat
		end tell
	end tell
end tell

-- Save the spreadsheet as an Excel file
tell application "Numbers"
	save newSpreadsheet as "Excel Workbook" in (choose folder with prompt "Choose export location")
