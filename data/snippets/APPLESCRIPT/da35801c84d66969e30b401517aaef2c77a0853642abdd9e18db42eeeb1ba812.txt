-- This code snippet uses AppleScript to search for a specific keyword in a text file and return the line number where it is found

--Set the path to the text file you want to search
set filePath to "path/to/textfile.txt"

--Set the keyword you are searching for
set keyword to "apple"

--Read the text file into a list
set textList to paragraphs of (read file filePath)

--Set the initial line number to 1
set lineNumber to 1

--Loop through each line in the text file list
repeat with currentLine in textList
	
	--Check if the current line contains the keyword
	if currentLine contains keyword then
		
		--Print the line number and the line containing the keyword
		log "Line " & lineNumber & ": " & currentLine
		
		--Exit the loop once the keyword is found
		exit repeat
		
	else
		
		--Increase the line number counter
		set lineNumber to lineNumber + 1
		
	end if
end repeat

--If the keyword was not found in the text file
if lineNumber > count of textList then
	
	--Print a message indicating the keyword was not found
	log "The keyword was not found in the text file."
	
end if
