-- This is a code snippet that creates a calculator using Applescript

set num1 to 10
set num2 to 5
set operation to "addition"

if operation is "addition" then
	set result to num1 + num2
else if operation is "subtraction" then
	set result to num1 - num2
else if operation is "multiplication" then
	set result to num1 * num2
else if operation is "division" then
	set result to num1 / num2
else
	set result to "Invalid operation"
end if

-- Display the result
display dialog "The result of " & num1 & " " & operation & " " & num2 & " is " & result
