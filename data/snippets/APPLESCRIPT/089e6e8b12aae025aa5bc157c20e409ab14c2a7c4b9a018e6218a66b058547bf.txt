-- This code snippet creates a script to automate the creation of multiple folders
-- The script will prompt the user for the number of folders to be created
-- and then generate them with incremented names, starting from "Folder 1"
-- The folders will be created on the user's desktop

-- Defining the number of folders to be created
display dialog "Enter number of folders to be created:" default answer "" with title "Create Folders"

-- Retrieving the input from the user
set numFolders to the text returned of the result

-- Converting the input to a number
set numFolders to numFolders as number

-- Creating a loop to generate folders
repeat with i from 1 to numFolders
	-- Setting the name of the folder
	set folderName to "Folder " & i
	
	-- Creating the folder on the desktop
	tell application "Finder"
		-- Checking if the folder already exists
		if not (exists folder folderName of desktop) then
			-- Creating the folder
			make new folder at desktop with properties {name:folderName}
		end if
	end tell
	
	-- Incrementing the counter
	set i to i + 1
end repeat

-- Displaying a notification when folders are created
display notification "Folders successfully created!" with title "Script Complete"
