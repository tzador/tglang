-- This code snippet sets up a function that sorts a list of integers in ascending order
on sortList(lst)
	repeat with i from 1 to count lst
		repeat with j from i + 1 to count lst
			if item i of lst > item j of lst then
				set temp to item i of lst
				set item i of lst to item j of lst
				set item j of lst to temp
			end if
		end repeat
	end repeat
	return lst
end sortList
