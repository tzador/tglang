(*
This code snippet will create a new folder with a specific name on the desktop using Applescript.
First, it will set the name of the folder to "New Folder".
Then, it will check if there is already a folder with the same name on the desktop.
If it exists, it will display an error message, if not, it will create the folder.
Finally, it will display a confirmation message when the folder is created successfully.
