-- This code snippet converts a list of numbers to binary and appends them to a text file

-- Create a list of numbers to convert
set numbers to {5, 9, 16, 27}

-- Define the output file path
set outputFilePath to (path to desktop as text) & "binaryNumbers.txt"

-- Open the output file in write mode
set outputFile to open for access file outputFilePath with write permission

-- Loop through each number in the list
repeat with i from 1 to count of numbers
    -- Convert number to binary and add a newline character at the end
    set binaryNumber to (number_to_binary(item i of numbers)) & linefeed
    
    -- Write binary number to the output file
    write binaryNumber to outputFile starting at eof
    
end repeat

-- Close the output file
close access outputFile
