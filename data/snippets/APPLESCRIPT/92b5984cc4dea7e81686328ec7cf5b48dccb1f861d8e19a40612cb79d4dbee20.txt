-- This code snippet takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list
set numList to {2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14}

-- Initialize a variable to store the sum
set totalSum to 0

-- Loop through the list of numbers
repeat with num in numList

    -- Check if the number is even
    if (num mod 2) is equal to 0 then

        -- Add the number to the total sum
        set totalSum to totalSum + num
    end if
end repeat

-- Output the total sum
totalSum

-- Expected Output: 34
