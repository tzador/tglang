-- This code snippet generates a random password.

-- First, we declare a list of possible characters for our password
set possibleChars to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+{}[];:<>?,./|"

-- Next, we ask the user for the desired length of the password
display dialog "Please enter the desired password length:" default answer "" buttons {"Cancel", "OK"} default button 2
set length to text returned of result

-- We will use the current date and time as a seed for our randomizer
set seed to (seconds of (current date)) as integer

-- Using the length input from the user, we will generate a random password
set password to ""
repeat with i from 1 to length
  -- We will use the "random number" command to generate a random number within the range of our list of possible characters
  -- We multiply by the current date and time to ensure that the number is truly random
  set randomNum to (round (random number from 1 to count possibleChars) * seed) -- Generating a random number
  set char to character randomNum of possibleChars -- Retrieving the character at that index in the list
  set password to password & char -- Appending the character to our password string
end repeat

-- Finally, we display the generated password to the user
display dialog "Your randomly generated password is:" & return & password buttons {"OK"} default button 1
