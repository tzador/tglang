-- This is a script to automate file organization on macOS.

-- When the script is run, it will ask for the location of the files to be organized.
set sourceFolder to choose folder with prompt "Please select the folder containing the files to be organized."

-- Next, it will ask for the destination folder where the files will be moved to.
set destinationFolder to choose folder with prompt "Please select the destination folder for the organized files."

-- The script will create a new folder in the destination folder with today's date as the name.
-- This will be used to store the organized files.
set dateString to do shell script "date +%m-%d-%Y"
set organizedFolder to make new folder at destinationFolder with properties {name:dateString}

-- The script will loop through all the files in the source folder and move them to the organized folder.
tell application "Finder"
    set fileList to every file of sourceFolder
    
    repeat with currentFile in fileList
        move currentFile to organizedFolder
    end repeat
end tell

-- The script will also create subfolders within the organized folder based on the file types.
set subFolders to {"PDFs", "Images", "Documents", "Videos", "Audio", "Other"}

-- The script will loop through all the files in the organized folder and move them to the appropriate subfolder.
tell application "Finder"
    set fileTypes to {"pdf", "jpg", "doc", "mp4", "mp3", "zip"}
    
    repeat with fileType in fileTypes
        set fileTypeFolder to make new folder at organizedFolder with properties {name:fileType}
        move (every file of organizedFolder whose name extension is fileType) to fileTypeFolder
    end repeat
end tell
