# This code snippet generates a random password with customizable parameters.

set passwordLength to 16 # Sets the length of the password to 16 characters
set useUpperCase to true # Sets whether to include uppercase letters in the password
set useLowerCase to true # Sets whether to include lowercase letters in the password
set useNumbers to true # Sets whether to include numbers in the password
set useSpecialChars to false # Sets whether to include special characters in the password
