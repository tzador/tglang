-- This code snippet is an example of a simple loop using AppleScript.

set x to 0 -- Set a variable to start at 0.
set y to 10 -- Set a variable to end at 10.

repeat with i from x to y -- Create a loop with the start and end values.
    if i mod 2 = 0 then -- Check if i is an even number.
        log i -- Output even numbers to the console.
    else
        display dialog "Odd number: " & i -- Output odd numbers in a dialog box.
    end if
    delay 1 -- Add a 1 second delay between each loop.
end repeat
