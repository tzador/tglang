--This code snippet calculates the average of a list of numbers in AppleScript
--Inputs: List of numbers
--Output: Average of the numbers

set numList to {3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15} --sample input list of numbers
set sum to 0 --initialize variable for sum
set count to count of numList --get the count of numbers in the list
repeat with i from 1 to count --loop through the numbers in the list
set sum to sum + (item i of numList) --add each number to the sum
end repeat
set avg to sum / count --calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count
return avg --return the average as output
