-- This is a long and complex code snippet in APPLESCRIPT
-- It contains a loop and multiple functions

-- Define a list of fruits
set fruits to {"apple", "banana", "orange", "mango", "kiwi"}

-- Initialize a counter
set i to 1

-- Start loop to iterate through list of fruits
repeat with fruit in fruits
  -- Check if fruit is a vowel
  if (fruit = "a" or fruit = "e" or fruit = "i" or fruit = "o" or fruit = "u") then
    display dialog fruit & " is a vowel."
  else 
    -- Get the length of fruit
    set fruitLength to length of fruit
    -- Set a new string with first half of fruit
    set firstHalf to text 1 thru (fruitLength / 2) of fruit
    -- Set a new string with second half of fruit
    set secondHalf to text ((fruitLength /2) + 1) thru (fruitLength) of fruit
    -- Combine both strings
    set newFruit to secondHalf & firstHalf
    -- Display the new fruit
    display dialog newFruit & " is a new fruit."
  end if
  -- Update counter
  set i to i + 1
end repeat

-- Display final message
display dialog "Finished looping through fruits."
