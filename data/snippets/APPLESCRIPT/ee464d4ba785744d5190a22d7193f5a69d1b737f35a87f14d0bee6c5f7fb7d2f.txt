-- This script takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list
set numbersList to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} -- example list of numbers

set evenSum to 0 -- variable to store the sum of even numbers
set oddSum to 0 -- variable to store the sum of odd numbers

-- loop through the list of numbers
repeat with i from 1 to length of numbersList
    set currentNumber to item i of numbersList -- get current number from the list
    
    if (currentNumber mod 2) is 0 then -- check if current number is even
        set evenSum to evenSum + currentNumber -- add current number to the evenSum variable
    else
        set oddSum to oddSum + currentNumber -- add current number to the oddSum variable
    end if
end repeat

return "The sum of even numbers in the list is " & evenSum -- print the result to the user
