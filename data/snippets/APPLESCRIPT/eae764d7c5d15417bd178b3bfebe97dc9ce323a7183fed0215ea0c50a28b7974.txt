(* Main program *)
set num1 to 5
set num2 to 10

-- call the calculate_sum function and store the result
set sum_result to calculate_sum(num1, num2)
-- call the calculate_product function and store the result
set product_result to calculate_product(num1, num2)

-- display the results
display dialog "The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & sum_result
