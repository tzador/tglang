-- This script creates a list of numbers, counts the total number of elements, and creates a new list based on certain conditions.
-- Input: a list of numbers
-- Output: a list of numbers that meet specified conditions
set numbersList to {1, 5, 2, 9, 3, 6, 8, 4, 7} -- sample list

-- Count the total number of elements in the list
set countList to count of numbersList

-- Create a new list based on certain conditions
set filteredList to {} -- empty list

repeat with i from 1 to countList
	set currentNumber to item i of numbersList -- get current element
	if currentNumber > 3 and currentNumber <= 7 then -- check if element meets conditions
		set end of filteredList to currentNumber -- add element to new list
	end if
end repeat

-- Print the filtered list
log filteredList -- output: {5, 6, 4}

-- Note: the filtered list only includes numbers that are greater than 3 and less than or equal to 7.
