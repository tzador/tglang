-- This code snippet creates a list of random numbers and calculates their sum

-- generate random numbers
set randomNumber1 to (random number from 1 to 10)
set randomNumber2 to (random number from 1 to 10)
set randomNumber3 to (random number from 1 to 10)
set randomNumber4 to (random number from 1 to 10)
set randomNumber5 to (random number from 1 to 10)

-- create a list of random numbers
set randomList to {randomNumber1, randomNumber2, randomNumber3, randomNumber4, randomNumber5}

-- calculate the sum of the list
set sum to 0
repeat with i from 1 to length of randomList
    set sum to sum + item i of randomList
end repeat

-- display the results
display dialog "The list is: " & randomList & "
The sum is: " & sum
