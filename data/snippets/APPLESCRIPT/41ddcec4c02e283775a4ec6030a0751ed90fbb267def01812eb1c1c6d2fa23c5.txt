-- This script will sort a list of numbers in ascending order

--Define a subroutine to perform insertion sort on a list
on insertionSort(myList)
	repeat with i from 2 to count of myList
		--Set the current element to be sorted
		set cur to item i of myList
		
		--Compare the current element with its previous element
        set j to i - 1
        repeat while j â‰¥ 1 and item j of myList > cur
			set item (j + 1) of myList to item j of myList
			set j to j - 1
		end repeat
		
		--Insert the current element into its proper position
		set item (j + 1) of myList to cur
	end repeat
end insertionSort

--Example list of numbers
set numbers to {7, 2, 9, 4, 1, 6, 8, 3, 5}

--Call the insertionSort subroutine on the list of numbers
insertionSort(numbers)

--Print the sorted list
