(*This is a long and complex AppleScript code snippet that is meant to showcase different features of the language*)

(*First, we define some variables to be used in our code*)
set myString to "Hello, world!"
set myNumber to 42
set myList to {1, 2, "apple", true}

(*Next, we create a repeat loop that will run 10 times*)
repeat 10 times
    (*Inside the loop, we use a conditional statement to check if the number is even or odd*)
    if myNumber mod 2 = 0 then
        (*If the number is even, we add it to our list*)
        set end of myList to myNumber
    else
        (*If the number is odd, we double it and add it to our list*)
        set end of myList to myNumber * 2
    end if
    (*We then increase the number by 1 for the next iteration*)
    set myNumber to myNumber + 1
end repeat

(*After the loop, we convert our list to a string and display it on the screen*)
set myString to (myString & " " & (myList as string))
display dialog myString buttons "OK"

(*Finally, we use a try block to handle any potential errors that may occur*)
try
    (*We divide a number by 0 to trigger an error*)
    set errorNumber to 5 / 0
on error errorMessage
    (*If an error occurs, we display a dialog box with the error message*)
    display dialog errorMessage buttons "OK"
end try
