--This code snippet is a script that takes user input and calculates the factorial of that number.

--Prompts user to input a number
display dialog "Enter a number:" default answer ""

--Declares a variable to store user input
set userInput to text returned of result

--Converts the user input to an integer
set userInteger to userInput as integer

--Declares a variable to store the final result
set factorial to 1

--Loops through all the numbers from 1 to the user input
repeat with i from 1 to userInteger

    --Multiplies the current factorial value with the loop counter (i)
    set factorial to factorial * i

end repeat

--Displays the result to the user
display dialog "The factorial of " & userInteger & " is " & factorial
