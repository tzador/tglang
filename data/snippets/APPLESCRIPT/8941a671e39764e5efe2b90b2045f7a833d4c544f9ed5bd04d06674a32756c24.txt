# This code snippet creates a function to calculate the factorial of a number using Applescript.

on factorial(num)
	-- Checks if the number is greater than 1
	if num > 1 then
		-- Multiplies the number by the factorial of the previous number
		return num * factorial(num - 1)
	else
		return 1
	end if
end factorial

-- Asks the user for input
set input to display dialog "Enter a number to calculate factorial:" default answer ""
set num to text returned of input

-- Calls the factorial function and stores the result in a variable
set result to factorial( (num as integer) )

-- Displays the result
display dialog ("The factorial of " & num & " is " & result)
