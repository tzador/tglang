(* This script creates a list of random numbers and sorts it in ascending order *)

-- Set the minimum and maximum values for the random numbers
set min to 1
set max to 100

-- Set the number of elements in the list
set listLength to 20

-- Initialize an empty list
set numberList to {}

-- Generate random numbers and add them to the list
repeat listLength times
	set randomNumber to random number from min to max
	set end of numberList to randomNumber
end repeat

-- Sort the list in ascending order
set sortedList to {}
repeat listLength times
	set lowestNumber to min of numberList
	set end of sortedList to lowestNumber
	set index of lowestNumber to 0 in numberList
end repeat

-- Print the sorted list
log sortedList
