# Annotated APPLESCRIPT code snippet
# This code snippet uses AppleEvents to open a URL in the default web browser
-- create an applescript object for the target application (in this case, 'System Events')
tell application "System Events"
	set targetApp to name of application processes whose frontmost is true -- get the name of the currently frontmost application
end tell

-- create an applescript object for the default browser (in this case, 'Safari')
tell application "System Events"
	set defaultBrowser to name of application processes whose frontmost is true and name is not targetApp -- get the name of the default browser
end tell

-- open a new process for the default browser
tell application defaultBrowser
	activate -- make the browser the frontmost application
	set newProcess to (make new process with properties {URL:"https://www.example.com"}) -- create a new process with the specified URL
end tell

-- check if the URL was successfully opened, otherwise open the URL with the default web browser
on error
	do shell script ("open https://www.example.com") -- open the URL in the default web browser using a shell script
end try

-- close the new process after a specified time (in this case, 30 seconds)
delay 30 -- wait for 30 seconds
tell application defaultBrowser to close newProcess -- close the new process
