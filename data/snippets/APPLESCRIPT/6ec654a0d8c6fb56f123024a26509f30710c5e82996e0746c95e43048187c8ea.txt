#### This is a complex code snippet in AppleScript
set myString to "This is a string" # declaring a variable
set myNumber to 10 # declaring another variable
if myNumber is equal to 10 then -- checking condition
	set myString to "This is another string" # changing value of myString
end if

repeat with i from 1 to 5
	set myNumber to i -- assigning value of i to myNumber
	repeat while myNumber is less than 10
		if myNumber mod 2 is equal to 0 then -- checking for even number
			set myString to "Even number: " & myNumber -- appending string to variable 
		else
			set myString to "Odd number: " & myNumber
		end if
		set myNumber to myNumber + 1 -- incrementing myNumber by 1
	end repeat
end repeat
