-- Applescript code snippet that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order
set numList to {5, 2, 9, 1, 7} -- sample list of numbers
set sortedList to {} -- empty list to store the sorted numbers
set listLength to count of numList -- get the length of the list
set lowIndex to 1 -- starting index for sorting
set highIndex to listLength -- ending index for sorting

-- loop through the list to find the smallest number
repeat listLength times
    set smallestNum to item lowIndex of numList -- set the smallest number as the first item in the list
    set smallestIndex to lowIndex -- set the index of the smallest number as the first index

    -- loop through the unsorted numbers to find the smallest number
    repeat with i from (lowIndex + 1) to listLength
        if item i of numList < smallestNum then -- if the current number is smaller than the smallest number
            set smallestNum to item i of numList -- set the smallest number to the current number
            set smallestIndex to i -- set the index of the smallest number
        end if
    end repeat

    -- add the smallest number to the sorted list
    set end of sortedList to smallestNum

    -- remove the smallest number from the unsorted list
    set numList to items 1 thru smallestIndex - 1 & items (smallestIndex + 1) thru listLength of numList
    set listLength to listLength - 1 -- decrease the list length by 1
end repeat

-- output the sorted list
return sortedList -- returns {1, 2, 5, 7, 9} as the sorted list in ascending order
