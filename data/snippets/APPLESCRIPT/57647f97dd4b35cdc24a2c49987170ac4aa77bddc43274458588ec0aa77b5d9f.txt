-- This is a complex code snippet in APPLESCRIPT

-- Set a variable to store a list of words
set wordList to {"apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"}

-- Loop through the list and display each word
repeat with currentWord in wordList
    display dialog "The current word is " & currentWord
end repeat

-- Create a function to find the length of a string
on countCharacters(inputString)
    -- Get the number of characters in the string
    set stringLength to count of inputString
    
    -- Display the length in a dialog box
    display dialog "The length of the string is " & stringLength
    
    -- Return the length of the string
    return stringLength
end countCharacters

-- Call the countCharacters function with a string as input
set myString to "Hello, world!"
countCharacters(myString)

-- Create a class called "Fruit" with properties and methods
script Fruit
    property type : null
    property color : null
    
    -- Method to display info about the fruit
    on displayInfo()
        display dialog "The " & type & " is " & color & " in color."
    end displayInfo
end script

-- Instantiate an instance of the Fruit class
set apple to Fruit
set type of apple to "apple"
set color of apple to "red"

-- Call the displayInfo method on the apple instance
displayInfo of apple

-- Create a handler to check if a number is prime
on isPrime(number)
    -- Initialize a counter
    set counter to 2
    
    -- Loop through numbers from 2 to number - 1
    repeat with i from 2 to number - 1
        -- Check if number is divisible by i
        if number mod i = 0 then
            -- Increment the counter if divisible
            set counter to counter + 1
        end if
    end repeat
    
    -- If counter is still 2, then the number is prime
    if counter = 2 then
        return true
    else
        return false
    end if
end isPrime

-- Call the isPrime handler with a number as input
set myNumber to 17
