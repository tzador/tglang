--This program iterates through a list of numbers and checks if they are divisible by 3, 5, or both.

--Define list of numbers
set numbersList to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

--Create empty lists for numbers divisible by 3, 5, and both
set divisibleByThree to {}
set divisibleByFive to {}
set divisibleByBoth to {}

repeat with num in numbersList
    if (num mod 3) = 0 then --Check if number is divisible by 3
        set end of divisibleByThree to num --Add number to divisible by 3 list
    end if
    if (num mod 5) = 0 then --Check if number is divisible by 5
        set end of divisibleByFive to num --Add number to divisible by 5 list
    end if
    if (num mod 3) = 0 and (num mod 5) = 0 then --Check if number is divisible by both 3 and 5
        set end of divisibleByBoth to num --Add number to divisible by both list
    end if
end repeat

--Print out the results
log "Numbers divisible by 3: " & divisibleByThree
log "Numbers divisible by 5: " & divisibleByFive
log "Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5: " & divisibleByBoth
