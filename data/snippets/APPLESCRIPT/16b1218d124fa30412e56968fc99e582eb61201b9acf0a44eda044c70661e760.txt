(*
  This code snippet shows how to create a list of names and sort them alphabetically using AppleScript.
  The output will be the sorted list.

  Author: [Your Name]
*)

(*
  We start by declaring our initial list of names.
  In AppleScript, lists are denoted by the keywords `list` and `of` between parentheses.
  Each item in the list is separated by a comma.
*)
set nameList to list of {"John", "Emily", "James", "Olivia", "Ben"}

(*
  Next, we use the `repeat` loop to iterate through the list.
  The `with` statement helps us in assigning an index number to each item in the list.
*)
repeat with i from 1 to count of nameList
  set currentItem to item i of nameList

  (*
    We use another `repeat` loop to compare each item with the rest of the list.
    The `while` statement ensures that we only compare items below the current index.
  *)
  repeat with j from (i + 1) to count of nameList while j < (count of nameList)
    set nextItem to item j of nameList

    (*
      If the current item is greater than the next item, we swap their positions in the list.
      The `if` statement checks the condition and the `then` statement executes the swap.
    *)
    if currentItem > nextItem then
      set item j of nameList to currentItem
      set item i of nameList to nextItem
    end if
  end repeat
end repeat

(*
  Finally, we print out the sorted list using the `display dialog` command.
  We use `with title` to provide a title for the dialog box.
*)
display dialog "The sorted list of names is: " & nameList with title "Sorted Names"
