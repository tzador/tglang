--This program calculates the factorial of a given number
set n to 5 --change this value to calculate the factorial of a different number
set factorial to 1

--loops through all numbers from 1 to n
repeat with i from 1 to n
    set factorial to factorial * i
end repeat

--prints the result
display dialog "The factorial of " & n & " is " & factorial buttons {"OK"}

--It can also be written as a function for reusable code
on calculateFactorial(n)
    set factorial to 1
    repeat with i from 1 to n
        set factorial to factorial * i
    end repeat

    return factorial
end calculateFactorial

--calling the function
set n to 10
set result to calculateFactorial(n)

--prints the result
