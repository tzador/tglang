-- This script generates a random number
set randomNumber to round (random number from 1 to 10) -- creates a variable with a random value between 1 to 10

-- This script calculates the factorial of a number
set userInput to text returned of (display dialog "Enter a number to find its factorial:" default answer "") -- prompts user for input
set userInput to userInput as number -- converts input to integer data type
set factResult to 1 -- sets initial value for factorial calculation
repeat userInput times -- begins repeat loop for the number of times equal to the user input
	set factResult to factResult * userInput -- multiplies the current result by the loop counter value
	set userInput to (userInput - 1) -- decrements the user input value by 1 for next iteration
end repeat

display dialog "The factorial of " & (text returned of (display dialog "Your input: " & userInput as string & ". The factorial is " & factResult as string)) -- displays the factorial value in a dialog box
