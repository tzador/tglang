(* This code snippet declares a variable, performs a loop, and displays a dialog box *)

-- Set the initial value of the variable
set x to 1 

-- Loop through a set of numbers
repeat while x < 10 
    -- Display a dialog box with the current value of x
    display dialog "The current value of x is " & x 
    -- Increment x by 1
    set x to x + 1 
end repeat 

(* The resulting dialog boxes would display values from 1 to 9, as the loop would end when x = 10 *)
