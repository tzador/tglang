-- This code snippet will prompt the user to enter a number and will then check if it is a prime number or not.

set num to text returned of (display dialog "Enter a number:" default answer "")

-- function to check if number is prime
on isPrime(x)
	set i to 2
	if x < 2 then return false -- a number less than 2 is not prime
	if x = 2 then return true -- 2 is a prime number
	repeat while i is less than or equal to x / 2 -- loop through all possible divisors
		if x mod i = 0 then -- if number is divisible by i, it is not prime
			return false
		end if
		set i to i + 1
	end repeat
	return true -- if number is not divisible by any other number, it is prime
end isPrime

if isPrime(num as integer) then
	display dialog num & " is a prime number"
