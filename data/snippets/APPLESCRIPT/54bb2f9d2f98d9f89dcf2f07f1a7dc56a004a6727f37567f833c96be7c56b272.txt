-- This code snippet demonstrates a complex sorting algorithm using Applescript
set myNumbers to {1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 9, 8, 4, 7} -- sample array of numbers
set myCount to count myNumbers

-- sort the numbers in ascending order using bubble sort
repeat with i from 1 to myCount
    repeat with j from 1 to (myCount - i)
        -- compare current number to the next number
        if item j of myNumbers > item (j + 1) of myNumbers then
            -- swap the numbers if needed
            set prevNumber to item j of myNumbers
            set myNumbers's item j to item (j + 1) of myNumbers
            set myNumbers's item (j + 1) to prevNumber
        end if
    end repeat
end repeat

-- print the sorted array to the console
log "Sorted array: " & myNumbers
