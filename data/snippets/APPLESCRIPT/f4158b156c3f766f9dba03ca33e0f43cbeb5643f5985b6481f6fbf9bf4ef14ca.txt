-- This code snippet is an example of a conditionals statement in Applescript
-- It checks the weather and returns a message based on the temperature

set currentTemp to 75 -- current temperature in Fahrenheit

if currentTemp < 50 then -- checks if temperature is less than 50 degrees
    display alert "It's too cold outside" buttons {"Stay Inside", "Bundle Up"} -- displays an alert if the temperature is too cold
else if currentTemp >= 50 and currentTemp < 80 then -- checks if temperature is between 50 and 80 degrees
    display alert "What a beautiful day!" buttons {"Go Outside", "Enjoy the Weather"} -- displays an alert if the temperature is pleasant
else -- if temperature is above 80 degrees
    display alert "It's too hot outside" buttons {"Stay Inside", "Find Somewhere Cool"} -- displays an alert if the temperature is too hot
end if-- ends the conditional statement
