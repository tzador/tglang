-- This is a complex AppleScript code snippet that demonstrates how to check for a specific file type in a given folder and move it to a different location. --

-- First, set the source folder path and the destination folder path --
set source_folder to "/Users/username/Documents"
set dest_folder to "/Users/username/Documents/PDFs"

-- Get a list of all the files in the source folder --
tell application "Finder"
	set file_list to every file of folder source_folder
end tell

-- Loop through each file in the list --
repeat with i from 1 to count of file_list

	-- Get the file type of the current file and check if it is a PDF --
	tell application "Finder"
		set file_type to type identifier of item i of file_list
	end tell
	
	-- If the file type is a PDF, move it to the destination folder --
	if file_type is "com.adobe.pdf" then
		set move_file to (item i of file_list) as alias
		tell application "Finder"
			move move_file to folder dest_folder
		end tell
	end if
end repeat 

-- Display a dialog box with a success message --
display dialog "All PDFs have been moved to the destination folder."
