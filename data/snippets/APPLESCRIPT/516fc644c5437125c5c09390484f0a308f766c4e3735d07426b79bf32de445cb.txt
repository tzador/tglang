-- This code snippet generates a list of random numbers and calculates the standard deviation

-- Set the number of numbers to generate
set numbersToGenerate to 100

-- Set the range of the random numbers
set minNumber to 1
set maxNumber to 100

-- Generate a list of random numbers
set randomNumberList to {}
repeat numbersToGenerate times
    set end of randomNumberList to (random number from minNumber to maxNumber)
end repeat

-- Calculate the mean of the numbers
set sumOfNumbers to 0
repeat numbersToGenerate times
    set sumOfNumbers to sumOfNumbers + item i of randomNumberList
end repeat
set mean to sumOfNumbers / numbersToGenerate

-- Calculate the sum of squared differences from the mean
set sumOfSquaredDifferences to 0
repeat numbersToGenerate times
    set sumOfSquaredDifferences to sumOfSquaredDifferences + ((item i of randomNumberList - mean) ^ 2)
end repeat

-- Calculate the variance
set variance to sumOfSquaredDifferences / numbersToGenerate

-- Calculate the standard deviation
set standardDeviation to (variance) ^ (1/2)

-- Print the list of random numbers and the standard deviation
log "Random Number List: " & randomNumberList & return & "Standard Deviation: " & standardDeviation
