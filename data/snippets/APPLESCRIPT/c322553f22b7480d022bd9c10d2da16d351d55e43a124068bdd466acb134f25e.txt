-- This code snippet creates a script that automates the process of sorting files based on their file type and moving them into corresponding folders.

-- Define a list of file extensions and corresponding folder names
set fileTypeList to {"docx", "xlsx", "pdf", "png", "jpeg"}
set folderList to {"Documents", "Spreadsheets", "PDFs", "Images", "Photos"}

-- Create a function to check if a file's extension matches a given file type
on checkFileType(fileExtension, fileType)
	set dotExtension to "." & fileExtension
	if dotExtension is equal to fileType then
		return true
	else
		return false
	end if
end checkFileType

-- Create a function to move the file into the correct folder based on its file type
on moveFile(file, fileType, folder)
	tell application "Finder"
		-- Create the folder if it doesn't exist already
		if not (exists folder folder) then
			make new folder at (get container of file) with properties {name:folder}
		end if
		-- Move file into the correct folder
		move file to folder folder
	end tell
end moveFile

-- Loop through all files in the designated folder
tell application "Finder"
	set sourceFolder to choose folder with prompt "Select a folder to organize:"
	set fileList to every file of sourceFolder
	
	repeat with file in fileList
		-- Get the file's extension
		set fileExtension to name extension of file
		-- Loop through the list of file types and corresponding folders
		repeat with i from 1 to count of fileTypeList
			-- Check if the file's extension matches the current file type
			if (checkFileType(fileExtension, item i of fileTypeList)) then
				-- Move the file into the correct folder
				moveFile(file, item i of fileTypeList, item i of folderList)
				exit repeat
			end if
		end repeat
