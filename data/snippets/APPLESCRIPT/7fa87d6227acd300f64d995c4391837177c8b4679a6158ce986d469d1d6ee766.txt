-- This code snippet creates a list of contacts and then displays them in a dialog box

-- First, we declare a list variable
set contactList to {}

-- Next, we add contacts to the list using a repeat loop
repeat 3 times
	-- This section prompts the user for contact information and stores it in variables
	set firstName to text returned of (display dialog "Enter the first name of the contact:")
	set lastName to text returned of (display dialog "Enter the last name of the contact:")
	set email to text returned of (display dialog "Enter the email address of the contact:")

	-- This section creates a dictionary for the contact and adds it to the contactList
	set contact to {first name:firstName, last name:lastName, email address:email}
	set end of contactList to contact
end repeat

-- Finally, we display the contactList in a dialog box
display dialog "Here is your list of contacts:" & return & return & contactList as text buttons {"OK"} default button "OK"
