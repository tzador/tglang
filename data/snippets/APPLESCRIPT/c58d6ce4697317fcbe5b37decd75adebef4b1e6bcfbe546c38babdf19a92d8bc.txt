# This is a complex code snippet that uses loops and conditional statements
# It creates a list of numbers and checks if each number is divisible by 3 or 5
# If the number is divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz"
# If the number is divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz"
# If the number is divisible by both, it prints "FizzBuzz"

set numberList to {} -- Initialize an empty list to store numbers
set maxNumber to 100 -- Define the maximum number to generate

-- Loop through numbers from 1 to maxNumber
repeat with i from 1 to maxNumber
    if i mod 3 = 0 and i mod 5 = 0 then -- Check if number is divisible by both 3 and 5
        set end of numberList to "FizzBuzz"
    else if i mod 3 = 0 then -- Check if number is divisible by 3
        set end of numberList to "Fizz"
    else if i mod 5 = 0 then -- Check if number is divisible by 5
        set end of numberList to "Buzz"
    else
        set end of numberList to i -- Add the number to the list if it's not divisible by 3 or 5
    end if
end repeat

-- Print out the list
repeat with n in numberList
    log n
end repeat
