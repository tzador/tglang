-- The following code snippet creates a function called "calculateAverage" that calculates the average of a given list of numbers.
-- It takes in an input list and returns the calculated average as a result.


on calculateAverage(numbers)
    set sum to 0 -- initialize the sum variable
    repeat with num in numbers -- loop through each number in the list
        set sum to sum + num -- add the number to the sum variable
    end repeat

    set count to count of numbers -- get the number of items in the list
    if count is not 0 then -- check if the list is not empty
        set average to sum / count -- calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of items
        return average -- return the calculated average
    else
        error "List is empty." -- if the list is empty, throw an error
    end if
end calculateAverage
