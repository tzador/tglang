-- This script will prompt the user to enter two numbers and perform basic mathematical operations on them
-- It will then display the result in a dialog box

display dialog "Enter first number:" default answer "" -- Prompt user to enter first number
set num1 to text returned of result as number -- Convert input to a number

display dialog "Enter second number:" default answer "" -- Prompt user to enter second number
set num2 to text returned of result as number -- Convert input to a number

set sum to num1 + num2 -- Add numbers
set difference to num1 - num2 -- Subtract numbers
set product to num1 * num2 -- Multiply numbers
if num2 is 0 then -- Check for division by 0
    set quotient to "Cannot divide by 0"
else
    set quotient to num1 / num2 -- Divide numbers
end if
