-- This program demonstrates a complex loop in AppleScript

set myNumbers to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -- create a list of numbers

set counter to 1 -- initiate a counter variable

repeat with i from 1 to length of myNumbers -- repeat the following code for each item in the list
	if item i of myNumbers is less than 3 then -- check if the current item is less than 3
		set item i of myNumbers to ((item i of myNumbers) * 2) -- multiply the item by 2
	else if item i of myNumbers is greater than 4 then -- check if the current item is greater than 4
		set item i of myNumbers to ((item i of myNumbers) + 10) -- add 10 to the item
	else -- if the item is between 3 and 4
		set item i of myNumbers to (item i of myNumbers) ^ 2 -- square the item
	end if
	
	set counter to (counter + 1) -- increase the counter by 1
end repeat

log myNumbers -- print the updated list to the console

-- Output: {2, 4, 9, 14, 25}
