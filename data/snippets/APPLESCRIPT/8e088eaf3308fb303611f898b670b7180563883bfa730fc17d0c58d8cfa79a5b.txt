-- This code snippet calculates the area of a circle given the radius
set radius to 5 -- Assigning a value to the radius variable
set pi to 3.14159265359 -- Assigning a value to the pi variable

-- Calculating the area of the circle using the formula A = Ï€r^2
set area to pi * (radius ^ 2) -- Assigning the result to the area variable

-- Displaying the result to the user
display dialog "The area of the circle with a radius of " & radius & " is " & area
