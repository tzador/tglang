-- This is a code snippet in AppleScript
-- It creates a script that calculates the square root of a given number
-- and displays it in a dialog box

-- Set up a prompt for the user to enter the number
set userNumber to text returned of (display dialog "Enter a number to calculate the square root:" default answer "")

-- Convert the user input to a number
set number to userNumber as number

-- Calculate the square root using the built-in function sqrt()
set squareRoot to sqrt(number)

-- Create a dialog box to display the result
display dialog "The square root of " & userNumber & " is " & squareRoot & "." buttons {"OK"} default button "OK" with icon caution
