set numbers_list to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10}

-- Creating a new empty list for unique numbers
set unique_numbers to {}

-- Looping through the original list of numbers
repeat with number in numbers_list
	-- Checking if the number is already in the unique numbers list
	if number is not in unique_numbers then
		-- Adding the number to the unique numbers list
		set end of unique_numbers to number
	end if
end repeat

-- Initializing a variable for sum
set sum_numbers to 0

-- Looping through the unique numbers list
repeat with number in unique_numbers
	-- Adding each number to the sum
	set sum_numbers to sum_numbers + number
end repeat

-- Printing the final sum
log "The sum of the unique numbers is " & sum_numbers
