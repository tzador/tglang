(*
This script generates a list of random numbers,
sorts them in ascending order,
and then squares each number in the list.

--Set the length of the list

--Generate a random number for each index in the list
repeat with i from 1 to listLength
	set randomNumber to (random number from 1 to 100)
	set item i of myList to randomNumber
end repeat

--Sort the list in ascending order using quicksort algorithm

--Print the final list
