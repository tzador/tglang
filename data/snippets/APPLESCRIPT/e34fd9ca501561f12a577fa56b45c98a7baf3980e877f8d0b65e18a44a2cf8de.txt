(* This code snippet generates a random password with specified length and complexity *)

(* Defining the length of the password *)
set passwordLength to 12

(* Defining the complexity of the password *)
set complexityLevel to "medium"

(* List of characters to choose from, based on complexity level *)
if complexityLevel is equal to "low" then
    set characterList to "1234567890"
else if complexityLevel is equal to "medium" then
    set characterList to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
else
    set characterList to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*()"

(* Generating a random password using the characterList *)
set newPassword to ""
repeat passwordLength times
    set newPassword to newPassword & (some item of characterList)

(* Printing the generated password *)
set the clipboard to newPassword
display dialog "Your randomly generated password is: " & newPassword
