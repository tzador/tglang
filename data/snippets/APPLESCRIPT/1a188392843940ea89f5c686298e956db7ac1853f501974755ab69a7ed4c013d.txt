-- This is a complex code snippet written in APPLESCRIPT
-- It takes in user input and converts it into lowercase, capitalizes the first letter, and stores it in a variable

set userInput to text returned of (display dialog "Enter any word or phrase:" default answer "" buttons {"Cancel", "Done"} default button "Done" cancel button "Cancel")
-- This line prompts the user to input a value and stores it in a variable called userInput

set lowercaseInput to do shell script "echo " & quoted form of userInput & " | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'"
-- This line uses the 'do shell script' command to convert the userInput into lowercase, using the 'tr' command in Unix, and stores it in a variable called lowercaseInput

set firstLetter to first item of characters of lowercaseInput
-- This line gets the first letter of the lowercaseInput and stores it in a variable called firstLetter

set uppercaseFirstLetter to (ASCII character (ASCII number firstLetter - 32))
-- This line uses ASCII codes to convert the lowercase first letter into uppercase and stores it in a variable called uppercaseFirstLetter

set finalInput to uppercaseFirstLetter & characters 2 thru -1 of lowercaseInput as string
-- This line combines the uppercase first letter with the rest of the lowercaseInput (excluding the first character) and stores it in a variable called finalInput

display dialog "Your input has been converted into: " & finalInput
-- This line displays a dialog box with the final converted input

-- Output:
-- Your input has been converted into: This is a complex code snippet written in applescript
