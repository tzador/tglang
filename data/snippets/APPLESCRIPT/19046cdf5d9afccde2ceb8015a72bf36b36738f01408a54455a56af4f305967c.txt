(* This is a complex code snippet in AppleScript that generates a random string of characters and numbers. *)

set characters to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789" (* list of characters and numbers to choose from *)
set randomString to ""

repeat with i from 1 to 20 (* create a string of 20 characters *)

    set randomIndex to random number from 1 to length of characters (* pick a random character/number from the list *)
    set randomChar to character randomIndex of characters (* choose the character at randomIndex from the list *)
    set randomString to randomString & randomChar (* add the character to the random string *)
    
end repeat

(* print the random string *)
log randomString
