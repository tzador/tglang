-- This is a complex AppleScript code that creates a list of contacts from a CSV file and sends them automated emails.

-- Setting up variables
set recipientList to {}
set emailSubject to "Important Announcement"
set emailMessage to "Hello [Contact], I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to let you know about some important updates. Best, [Your Name]"

-- Reading CSV file
set csvData to read file "contacts.csv"
set csvRecords to paragraphs of csvData

-- Looping through CSV data
repeat with i from 2 to count of csvRecords
	-- Adding each contact's information to the recipient list
	set contactInfo to item i of csvRecords
	set contactName to text 1 thru 9 of contactInfo -- assumes contact name is at the beginning of the line
	set contactEmail to text 11 thru end of contactInfo -- assumes contact email is after a tab
	set end of recipientList to {name:contactName, address:contactEmail}
end repeat

-- Looping through recipient list to send emails
repeat with contact in recipientList
	-- Creating a message for each contact
	set emailContent to replaceText("[Contact]", (name of contact), emailMessage)
	set emailContent to replaceText("[Your Name]", "John Smith", emailContent)
	
	-- Sending email using Mail.app
	tell application "Mail"
		set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:emailSubject, content:emailContent}
		tell newMessage
			make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {name:name of contact, address:address of contact}
			send
		end tell
	end tell
end repeat

-- Function to replace text in a string
on replaceText(find, replace, sourceText)
	set prevTIDs to text item delimiters of AppleScript
	set AppleScript's text item delimiters to find
	set sourceText to text items of sourceText
	set AppleScript's text item delimiters to replace
	set sourceText to "" & sourceText
	set AppleScript's text item delimiters to prevTIDs
