-- This is a code snippet that searches for all files with a specific keyword in their filename, and then moves them to a designated folder.

-- First, we declare the keyword we want to search for
set keyword to "apple"

-- We also declare the destination folder where we want to move the files
set destination_folder to "path/to/destination/folder"

-- We use the "do shell script" command to run a terminal command that searches for all files with the keyword in their filename
-- The "quoted form" function ensures that the keyword is properly formatted for the terminal command
set allFiles to do shell script "find . -name " & quoted form of keyword

-- We use the "paragraphs" function to separate each file path in the output into its own element in a list
set found_files to paragraphs of allFiles

-- We then loop through each file path and check if it ends with the keyword, indicating that it is a file we want to move
repeat with currentFile in found_files

    if currentFile ends with keyword then
        
        -- We use the "tell application" command to interact with the Finder application and move the file to the designated folder
        -- The "POSIX path" function converts the file path to a format that the Finder can understand
        tell application "Finder"
            move (POSIX file currentFile as alias) to POSIX file (destination_folder & (characters 3 thru -1 of currentFile as text) as string) as alias
        end tell
    end if

end repeat

-- Finally, we display a success message
display dialog "All files with the keyword " & keyword & " have been moved to the destination folder." buttons {"OK"} giving up after 5
