-- This code snippet creates a basic todo list in the Notes app on MacOS
-- It prompts the user for the title and details of each task and adds it to a new note

set todoList to {} -- creates an empty list to store tasks

display dialog "Enter the title of the task:" default answer "" -- prompts user for title
set taskTitle to text returned of result -- assigns user input to a variable

display dialog "Enter details of the task:" default answer "" -- prompts user for task details
set taskDetails to text returned of result -- assigns user input to a variable

set end of todoList to (taskTitle & " - " & taskDetails) -- adds task title and details to list
set newNote to "Todo List" & return & return & (items of todoList as string with delimiter return) -- creates formatted note

tell application "Notes" -- starts a new Notes app process
	set newTask to make new note with properties {body:newNote} -- creates new note with the formatted list
	activate -- brings new note to front
end tell
