-- This is a code snippet in Applescript for a basic calculator --

-- Set input values --
set firstNumber to 2
set secondNumber to 3

-- Calculate the sum of the two numbers --
set sum to firstNumber + secondNumber
-- Output the sum in a user-friendly message --
display dialog "The sum of " & firstNumber & " and " & secondNumber & " is " & sum
-- Calculate the difference of the two numbers --
set difference to firstNumber - secondNumber
-- Output the difference in a user-friendly message --
display dialog "The difference between " & firstNumber & " and " & secondNumber & " is " & difference
-- Calculate the product of the two numbers --
set product to firstNumber * secondNumber
-- Output the product in a user-friendly message --
display dialog "The product of " & firstNumber & " and " & secondNumber & " is " & product
-- Calculate the quotient of the two numbers --
set quotient to firstNumber / secondNumber
-- Output the quotient in a user-friendly message --
display dialog "The quotient of " & firstNumber & " and " & secondNumber & " is " & quotient
