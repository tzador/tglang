-- This is a script that calculates the square root of a given number
set inputNumber to 64 -- Change this number to calculate the square root of a different number
set answer to inputNumber -- Set the answer equal to the input number

repeat until answer * answer = inputNumber -- Loop until the answer multiplied by itself is equal to the input number
	set answer to (answer + (inputNumber / answer)) / 2 -- Calculate the next guess for the square root
end repeat

set result to answer -- Set the result equal to the final guess for the square root

-- Print the result in a user-friendly format
display dialog "The square root of " & inputNumber & " is " & result buttons {"OK"} default button "OK"

-- The code above can be replaced with the following shortened version:
set inputNumber to 64 -- Change this number to calculate the square root of a different number
display dialog "The square root of " & inputNumber & " is " & (sqrt of inputNumber) buttons {"OK"} default button "OK"
