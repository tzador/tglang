-- This is a script that calculates the factorial of a given number
set num to 6 -- change this number to calculate factorial for a different number
set result to factorial(num) -- calls the factorial function to calculate the factorial of the given number
display dialog "The factorial of " & num & " is " & result -- displays the result in a dialog box

-- Function to calculate the factorial of a given number

	if num = 0 then -- checks if the number is 0
		return 1
	else
		return num * factorial(num - 1) -- calls the function recursively to calculate the factorial
