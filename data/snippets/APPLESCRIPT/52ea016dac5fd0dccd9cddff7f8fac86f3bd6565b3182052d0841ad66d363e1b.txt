-- This code snippet is a basic AppleScript that prompts the user for their name and outputs a personalized message.
-- It also includes comments to explain each step of the code.

-- First, we declare a variable to store the user's name
set userName to ""

-- Next, we use the "display dialog" command to prompt the user for their name and store the input in the "userName" variable
display dialog "Please enter your name:" default answer "" buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with title "Name Prompt"
set userName to the text returned of result

-- Then, we use the "if" statement to check if the user entered a name or left it blank
if userName is equal to "" then
    -- If the user left it blank, we display an error message using the "display alert" command
    display alert "Error" message "You did not enter a name. Please try again." buttons {"OK"} default button 1 as warning with title "Name Error"
else
    -- If the user entered a name, we use the "dialog box" command to display a personalized message
    display dialog "Hello " & userName & ", welcome to my program!" buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with title "Welcome Message"
end if
