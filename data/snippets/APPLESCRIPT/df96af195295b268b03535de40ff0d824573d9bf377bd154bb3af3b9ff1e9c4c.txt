(*
This is a complex AppleScript code snippet that demonstrates how to:
- Create a list
- Sort the list
- Use if statements
- Use a repeat loop
- Use a handler/function
*)

-- Create a list
set myList to {"Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Grapes"}

-- Sort the list
set sortedList to {}
repeat while (count of myList) > 0
	set smallest to item 1 of myList
	set smallestIndex to 1
	repeat with i from 2 to (count of myList)
		if item i of myList comes before smallest then
			set smallest to item i of myList
			set smallestIndex to i
		end if
	end repeat
	set end of sortedList to smallest
	set myList to (items 1 through smallestIndex - 1 of myList) & (items (smallestIndex + 1) through end of myList)
end repeat

-- Use if statements
if (count of sortedList) > 1 then
	-- Use a repeat loop
	repeat with i from 1 to (count of sortedList)
		-- Use a handler/function
		set myList to addItemToList(sortedList, "Pineapple")
	end repeat
end if

-- Handler/function to add item to list
on addItemToList(myList, newItem)
	set end of myList to newItem
	return myList
end addItemToList

-- Print the final list
log sortedList
