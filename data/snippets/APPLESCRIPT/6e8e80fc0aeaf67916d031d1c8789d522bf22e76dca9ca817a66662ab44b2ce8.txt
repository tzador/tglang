(* This is a longer code snippet in AppleScript. *)

-- This section defines a function that takes in two integer parameters and returns their sum. 

on sumIntegers(n, m)
    set sum to n + m
    return sum
end sumIntegers

-- This section creates a list of integers and assigns it to a variable.

set intList to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

-- This section loops through the list and prints out the sum of each integer and its index.

repeat with i from 1 to length of intList
    set currentInt to item i of intList
    set index to i
    set sum to sumIntegers(currentInt, index)
    log "The sum of " & currentInt & " and " & index & " is " & sum
end repeat

-- This section checks if the sum of the integers in the list is greater than 10 and prints out a message accordingly.

if sum of intList > 10 then
    log "The sum is greater than 10."
else
    log "The sum is less than or equal to 10."
end if
