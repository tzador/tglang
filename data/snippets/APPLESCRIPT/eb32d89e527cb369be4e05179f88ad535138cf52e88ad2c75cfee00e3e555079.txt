set userInput to display dialog "Enter your name:" default answer "" --Asks user to input their name
set userResult to text returned of userInput --Stores the user's input in a variable
display dialog "Hello " & userResult & ", welcome to my program!" --Uses the input in a dialog message

if button returned of (display dialog "Do you like apples?") is "OK" then --Asks user if they like apples
	set appleAmount to display dialog "How many apples do you have?" default answer "" --Asks for amount of apples they have
	set appleResult to text returned of appleAmount --Stores apple amount in a variable
	display dialog "You have " & appleResult & " apples. That's great!" --Displays a message with the user's apple count
else if button returned of (display dialog "Do you like bananas?") is "OK" then --Asks user if they like bananas
	set bananaAmount to display dialog "How many bananas do you have?" default answer "" --Asks for amount of bananas they have
	set bananaResult to text returned of bananaAmount --Stores banana amount in a variable
	display dialog "You have " & bananaResult & " bananas. Yum!" --Displays a message with the user's banana count
