(*
This is a complex code snippet in APPLESCRIPT that checks if a given number is prime or not.
It takes in a user input and prints the result.
*)

-- Setting up variables
set userInput to text returned of (display dialog "Enter a positive integer:" default answer "") -- Prompts user to enter a positive integer
set num to userInput as integer -- Converts user input into an integer
set isPrime to true -- Flag to check if the number is prime
set div to 2 -- Starting divisor

-- Loop to check if the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself
repeat while div < num
	set remainder to num mod div -- Checks the remainder when divided by the divisor
	if remainder = 0 then -- If the remainder is 0, then the number is not prime
		set isPrime to false
		exit repeat -- Exits the loop if the number is not prime
	end if
	set div to div + 1 -- Increases the divisor by 1
end repeat

-- Printing the result based on the value of isPrime flag
if isPrime then
	display dialog num & " is a prime number." -- Prints if the number is prime
else
	display dialog num & " is not a prime number." -- Prints if the number is not prime
end if
