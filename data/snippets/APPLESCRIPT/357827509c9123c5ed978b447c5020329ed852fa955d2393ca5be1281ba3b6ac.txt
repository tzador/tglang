(*
This is a script that takes in a list of names and greets each name with a personalized message.
*)

(* First, we define our list of names *)
set namesList to {"John", "Jane", "Michael", "Emily", "David"}

(* Next, we loop through the namesList using a repeat loop *)
repeat with currentName in namesList

    (* We use the `display dialog` command to show a dialog box with the personalized message *)
    display dialog "Hello " & currentName & "! How are you doing today?"

end repeat
