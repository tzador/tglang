--Create a property list with the list of students
--The plist will be saved as a .plist file
set studentPlist to {students:studentList}

--Set the save path for the plist file
set savePath to (path to desktop) & "studentList.plist"

--Create a new property list file at the save path
set newPlistFile to open for access file savePath with write permission

--Insert the plist data into the new property list file
set eof of newPlistFile to 0
write studentPlist to newPlistFile
close access newPlistFile

--To read the data from the plist file, use this code:
