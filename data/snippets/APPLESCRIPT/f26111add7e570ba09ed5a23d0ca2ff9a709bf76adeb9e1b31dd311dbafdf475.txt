--This code snippet generates a random password with specified length

--Set the desired length for the password
set passLength to 8

--Create list of characters to choose from
--The first group contains numbers
set chars to {"0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"}
--The second group contains uppercase letters
set chars to chars & ASCII character from 65 to 90
--The third group contains lowercase letters
set chars to chars & ASCII character from 97 to 122
--The fourth group contains special characters
--We use the ASCII codes 33-47 for special characters
set chars to chars & ASCII character from 33 to 47

--Initialize a list to store the password characters
set passList to {}

--Loop through the specified length
repeat passLength times
	--Choose a random character from the list
	set rndChar to some item of chars
	--Add it to the list
	set end of passList to rndChar
end repeat

--Convert the list to a string
set password to passList as string

--Print the generated password
Log password
