-- This AppleScript code snippet will create folders and files on the desktop
-- and will open a specific application based on the file extension

-- First, we define the path where we want to create the folders and files
set desktopPath to "~/Desktop"

-- Next, we create three folders on the desktop
tell application "Finder"
	set newFolder1 to make new folder at desktopPath with properties {name:"Folder1"}
	set newFolder2 to make new folder at desktopPath with properties {name:"Folder2"}
	set newFolder3 to make new folder at desktopPath with properties {name:"Folder3"}
end tell

-- Then, we create three different files within each folder
tell application "Finder"
	set filePath1 to desktopPath & "Folder1:File1.txt"
	set newFile1 to make new file at folder newFolder1 with properties {name:"File1", file type:"txt"}
	make new document at newFile1
	set filePath2 to desktopPath & "Folder2:File2.docx"
	set newFile2 to make new file at folder newFolder2 with properties {name:"File2", file type:"docx"}
	make new document at newFile2
	set filePath3 to desktopPath & "Folder3:File3.png"
	set newFile3 to make new file at folder newFolder3 with properties {name:"File3", file type:"png"}
	make new document at newFile3
end tell

-- Finally, we use the file extension to open the appropriate applications
set fileExtension1 to ".txt"
set fileExtension2 to ".docx"
set fileExtension3 to ".png"
tell application "Finder"
	open fileFilePath1 with default application for file type fileExtension1
	open fileFilePath2 with default application for file type fileExtension2
	open fileFilePath3 with default application for file type fileExtension3
end tell
