-- This is a comment explaining the following code snippet
tell application "Finder" -- specifies the application the script will interact with
	set myList to {555, 777, 999} -- creates a list of numbers
	set myListLength to length of myList -- gets the number of items in the list
	repeat with i from 1 to myListLength -- repeats the following code for each item in the list
		set itemValue to item i of myList -- gets the current value of the item
		if itemValue is equal to 555 then -- checks if the item value is equal to 555
			display dialog "Item value is 555" -- displays a dialog box with a message
		else if itemValue is equal to 777 then -- checks if the item value is equal to 777
			tell application "System Events" -- specifies the application the following code will interact with
				key code 36 using {command down} -- simulates pressing the enter key with the command key held down
				delay 1 -- adds a one second delay
			end tell
		else -- if none of the above conditions are met
			display dialog "Item value is not 555 or 777"
		end if
	end repeat
