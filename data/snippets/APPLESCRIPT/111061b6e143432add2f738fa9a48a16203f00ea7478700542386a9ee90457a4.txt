-- This is a code snippet that uses Applescript to copy, rename, and move a file to a new folder.
-- The file we are working with is "my_file.txt" and we want to copy it, change its name to "new_file.txt", and move it to the "Documents" folder.

set sourceFile to "my_file.txt" -- set the file we want to copy and move
set newName to "new_file.txt" -- set the new name we want for the file

-- get the current folder containing the script
tell application "Finder"
	set currentFolder to container of (path to me)
	set currentPath to (currentFolder as text)
end tell

-- set the destination folder path
set destinationPath to (currentPath & "Documents:" & newName)

-- copy the file to the new destination
tell application "Finder"
	copy file sourceFile to folder destinationPath
end tell

-- rename the copied file to the new name
tell application "Finder"
	set name of file (destinationPath & ":" & sourceFile) to newName
end tell
