-- This code snippet is an example of a script that iteratively calculates and prints the factorial of a given number.

set number to 5 -- set the number whose factorial we want to calculate

set result to 1 -- initialize result variable

repeat number times -- loop through function for the number of times specified

set result to result * number -- multiply current result by current number

set number to number - 1 -- change current number to next number in sequence

end repeat

display dialog "The factorial of " & (number + 1) & " is " & result -- display result in dialog box
