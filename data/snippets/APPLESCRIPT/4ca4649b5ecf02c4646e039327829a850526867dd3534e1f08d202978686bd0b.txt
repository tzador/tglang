    set name to item 1 of person -- assigns the first item (name) in the set to the variable "name"
    set age to item 2 of person -- assigns the second item (age) in the set to the variable "age"
    set output to output & "My name is " & name & " and I am " & age & " years old.\n" -- appends a sentence to the output string using the values from the set
end repeat
