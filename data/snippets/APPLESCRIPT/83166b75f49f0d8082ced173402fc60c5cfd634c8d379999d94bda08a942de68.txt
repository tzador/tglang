-- define a main function
on main()
  set firstNumber to 10 --> set the value of a variable
  set secondNumber to 5
  set result to firstNumber + secondNumber --> perform addition
  display dialog "The sum of " & firstNumber & " and " & secondNumber & " is " & result
  --> display the sum of the two numbers in a dialog box
  set result to doMultiply(firstNumber, secondNumber) --> call a function and assign its return value to a variable
  display dialog "The product of " & firstNumber & " and " & secondNumber & " is " & result
  --> display the product of the two numbers in a dialog box
end main

-- define a function for multiplying two numbers
on doMultiply(x, y)
  return x * y --> return the product of the two numbers
end doMultiply
