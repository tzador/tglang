-- Define a list of numbers
set myList to {5, 2, 9, 10, 4, 1, 7}

-- Sort the list in ascending order
set sortedList to myList as list
repeat with i from 1 to length of sortedList
	set minIndex to i
	set minValue to item i of sortedList
	repeat with j from (i + 1) to length of sortedList
		if item j of sortedList < minValue then
			set minIndex to j
			set minValue to item j of sortedList
		end if
	end repeat
	set item i of sortedList to minValue
	set item minIndex of sortedList to item i of sortedList
end repeat

-- Calculate the sum of the numbers in the list
set sum to 0
repeat with i from 1 to length of sortedList
	set sum to sum + item i of sortedList
end repeat

-- Calculate the average of the numbers in the list
set average to sum / (length of sortedList)

-- Print the results in the console
display dialog "Sorted List: " & sortedList & return & return & "Average: " & average buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with title "List and Average"
