(*
This is a code snippet in AppleScript that will get the number of keyboards connected to the device and print them out in a dialog box.
*)

set numKeyboards to count of (sysinfo "keyboard")
(*
First, we use the "sysinfo" command to get information about the device's hardware. In this case, we are specifically looking for the number of keyboards connected. We then use the "count of" command to get the number of items in the resulting list.
*)

display dialog "There is/are " & numKeyboards & " keyboard/s connected."
(*
Next, we use the "display dialog" command to create a dialog box that will display the number of keyboards connected. The "&" symbol is used to concatenate strings and variables together.
