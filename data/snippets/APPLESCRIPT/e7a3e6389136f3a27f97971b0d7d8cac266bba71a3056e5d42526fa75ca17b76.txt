-- This is a complex code snippet in APPLESCRIPT

-- Variables and their values are declared and assigned
set x to 10
set y to 5
set z to "Hello"

-- Conditional statements to compare values of variables
if x > y then
  -- Printing the value of z variable
  log z
else if x < y then
  -- Performing a mathematical operation and printing the result
  log (x * y)
else
  -- Printing a string
  log "x and y are equal"

-- Loop to iterate through a range of numbers
repeat with i from 1 to 20
  -- Checking if number is even
  if i mod 2 = 0 then
    -- Printing the number
    log i
  end if
end repeat

-- Function to check if given number is prime
on isPrime(num)
  -- Initializing a counter variable
  set counter to 0
  -- Loop to check if number is divisible by any number besides 1 and itself
  repeat with j from 2 to (num - 1)
    if num mod j = 0 then
      -- Incrementing the counter variable if number is divisible
      set counter to counter + 1
    end if
  end repeat
  -- If counter is 0, the number is prime
  if counter = 0 then
    -- Returning a boolean value
    return true
  else
    return false
  end if
end isPrime

-- Printing out the result of the function with a given number as input
log isPrime(17)

-- Declaring and initializing a list
set fruits to {"apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"}

-- Loop to iterate through the list
repeat with fruit in fruits
  -- Checking for a specific fruit and removing it if it exists
  if fruit = "banana" then
    set index to fruits's get index of "banana"
    set fruits to fruits's remove item index
  end if
end repeat

-- Printing the updated list
log fruits
