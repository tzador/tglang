-- This is a complex code snippet that demonstrates the use of lists and loops in AppleScript.

-- This section creates a list of fruits.
set fruits to {"apple", "orange", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"}

-- This section creates a list of prices.
set prices to {1.50, 2.00, 0.75, 3.00, 2.50}

-- This section creates an empty list to store the total costs.
set total_costs to {}

-- This section calculates the total cost for each fruit by multiplying the price by 10.
repeat with i from 1 to length of fruits
	set fruit_cost to item i of prices * 10
	set end of total_costs to fruit_cost
end repeat

-- This section calculates the sum of all the total costs.
set total_cost to 0
repeat with i from 1 to length of total_costs
	set total_cost to total_cost + item i of total_costs
end repeat

-- This section displays the results.
