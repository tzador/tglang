It then prints out the final list of numbers.

-- creating the list of numbers
set numList to {5, 9, 18, 3}

-- function to multiply and add 1 to a given number
on multiplyPlusOne(num)
    set resultNum to num * 2
    set resultNum to resultNum + 1
    return resultNum
end multiplyPlusOne

-- looping through the list and applying the function to each number
repeat with i from 1 to length of numList
    set element to item i of numList
    set element to multiplyPlusOne(element)
    set item i of numList to element
end repeat

-- printing out the final list of numbers
log "The final list is: " & numList

-- input: {5, 9, 18, 3}
-- output: {11, 19, 37, 7}
