-- Annotated Code Snippet in Applescript

-- This part of the code defines a global variable
-- called "total number" and sets its initial value to 10
global total number = 10

-- This function adds two numbers together and returns the result
on addNumbers(num1, num2)
	set sum to num1 + num2
	return sum
end addNumbers

-- This is a handler that takes in a list of names
-- and prints out a personalized greeting for each name
on greet(names)
	repeat with i from 1 to count of names
		set curr_name to item i of names
		display dialog "Hello " & curr_name & "!"
	end repeat
end greet

-- This part of the code calls the addNumbers function
-- and passes in two numbers as arguments
set a to 5
set b to 7
set result to addNumbers(a, b)

-- This part of the code creates a list of names
-- and calls the greet handler to print out greetings for each name
set name_list to {"John", "Jane", "Bob"}
greet(name_list)

-- This if statement checks if the result is greater than 10
-- and displays a message if it is
if result is greater than 10 then
	display dialog "The result is greater than 10!"
end if
