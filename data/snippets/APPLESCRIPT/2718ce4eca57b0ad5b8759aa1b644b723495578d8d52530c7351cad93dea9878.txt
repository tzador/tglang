--This is a code snippet in APPLESCRIPT that uses a repeat loop to generate a list of random numbers and then sorts them in ascending order 

--Create an empty list to store the random numbers 
set randomNumList to {}

--Set the number of iterations for the loop 
set numIterations to 10

--Use the repeat loop to generate and add 10 random numbers to the list 
repeat numIterations times
	
	--Generate a random number between 1 and 100 
	set randomNum to (random number from 1 to 100)
	
	--Add the random number to the end of the list 
	set end of randomNumList to randomNum
end repeat

--Sort the list in ascending order 
set sortedList to {}
repeat while (count of randomNumList) > 0
	
	--Find the smallest number in the list 
	set smallestNum to item 1 of randomNumList
	repeat with i from 2 to (count of randomNumList)
		if item i of randomNumList is less than smallestNum then
			set smallestNum to item i of randomNumList
		end if
	end repeat
	
	--Add the smallest number to the beginning of the sorted list 
	set end of sortedList to smallestNum
	
	--Remove the smallest number from the original list 
	set indexToRemove to (item (index of smallestNum) of randomNumList)
	set randomNumList to ((items 1 through (indexToRemove - 1)) & (items (indexToRemove + 1) through (count of randomNumList)) of randomNumList)
end repeat 

--Print the sorted list 
set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ", "
return "Sorted list: " & (sortedList as text)
