-- This script creates a list of random numbers and sorts them in ascending order

-- Set the desired length of the list
set listLength to 10

-- Create an empty list
set randomList to {}

-- Generate random numbers and add them to the list
repeat listLength times
    set randomNumber to random number from 1 to 100
    set end of randomList to randomNumber
end repeat

-- Sort the list in ascending order using insertion sort algorithm
repeat with i from 1 to length of randomList
    set j to i
    set currentValue to item j of randomList
    repeat while j > 1 and (item (j - 1) of randomList) > currentValue
        set item j of randomList to (item (j - 1) of randomList)
        set j to j - 1
    end repeat
    set item j of randomList to currentValue
end repeat

-- Print the sorted list
log "Sorted list: " & randomList
