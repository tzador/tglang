-- This is a complex code snippet in applescript
    -- It creates a dialog box, prompts for user input, and adds the input to a list
    -- It then loops through the list and performs a calculation on each item
    -- Finally, it displays the results in a new dialog box
    
    --Create a new dialog box with a specified title
    set inputDialog to (display dialog "Enter numbers to be added:" with title "Input" default answer "")
    
    --Get the user's input from the dialog box and store it in a variable
    set userInput to text returned of inputDialog
    
    --Split the input into separate items and store them in a list
    set inputList to paragraphs of userInput
    
    --Initialize a variable to store the sum
    set sum to 0
    
    --Loop through the list and perform calculations
    repeat with currentNumber in inputList
        --Convert the current item from text to number
        set currentNumber to currentNumber as number
        
        --Add the current item to the sum
        set sum to sum + currentNumber
    end repeat
    
    --Create a new dialog box to display the results
    display dialog "The sum is " & sum with title "Output"
