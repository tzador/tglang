-- This code snippet creates a function in applescript that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list with the square root of each number
on squareRootList(nums)
    set resultsList to {} -- initialize empty list to store results
    repeat with num in nums -- loop through input list
        set squareRoot to (num ^ 0.5) -- raise number to 0.5 power to get square root
        set end of resultsList to squareRoot -- append square root to results list
    end repeat
    return resultsList -- return final list with square root values
end squareRootList
