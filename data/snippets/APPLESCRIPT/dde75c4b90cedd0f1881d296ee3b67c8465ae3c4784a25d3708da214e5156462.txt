(*This code snippet is a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division based on user input*)

set firstNum to null --set first number to null
set secondNum to null --set second number to null
set operation to null --set operation to null
set result to null --set result to null

display dialog "Enter first number:" default answer "" --opens a dialog box to ask for first number
set firstNum to text returned of result --sets the firstNum variable to the input from the dialog box

display dialog "Enter second number:" default answer "" --opens a dialog box to ask for second number
set secondNum to text returned of result --sets the secondNum variable to the input from the dialog box

choose from list {"Addition", "Subtraction", "Multiplication", "Division"} --displays a list for the user to choose the desired operation
set operation to result as text --sets the operation variable to the chosen operation from the list

if operation is "Addition" then --performs addition if operation variable is "Addition"
	set result to firstNum + secondNum --adds the two numbers and sets the result variable to the sum
else if operation is "Subtraction" then --performs subtraction if operation variable is "Subtraction"
	set result to firstNum - secondNum --subtracts the second number from the first and sets the result variable to the difference
else if operation is "Multiplication" then --performs multiplication if operation variable is "Multiplication"
	set result to firstNum * secondNum --multiplies the two numbers and sets the result variable to the product
else if operation is "Division" then --performs division if operation variable is "Division"
	set result to firstNum / secondNum --divides the first number by the second and sets the result variable to the quotient
end if --ends the if statement

display dialog "The result is: " & result buttons {"OK"} default button "OK" --displays a dialog box with the result of the operation
