-- This script uses AppleScript to automate the creation of new folders and files.
-- It prompts the user for a folder name and creates a new folder with that name,
-- and then creates a text file within the folder with some placeholder text.

-- Setting up variables for folder name and file content
set folderName to ""
set fileContent to "This is a placeholder text. Replace it with your own content."

-- Prompting user for folder name
display dialog "Enter folder name:" default answer ""
set folderName to text returned of result

-- Creating the folder using folderName variable
set newFolder to POSIX file ("/Users/Username/Desktop/" & folderName)
tell application "Finder"
	make new folder at newFolder
end tell

-- Creating the text file within the folder
set newFile to newFolder & "placeholder.txt"
set fileContent to do shell script "echo " & quoted form of fileContent & " >> " & quoted form of POSIX path of newFile
do shell script "open " & quoted form of POSIX path of newFile
