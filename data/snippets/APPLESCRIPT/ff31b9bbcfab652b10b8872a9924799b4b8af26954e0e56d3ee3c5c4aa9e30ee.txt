(* This script generates a random password with customizable length and complexity *)

(* Initialize variables *)
set length to 10 -- change this to desired length
set complex_letters to {"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", "1234567890", "!@#$%&*"} -- letters for complexity
set password to "" -- initialize password variable

(* Main loop to generate password *)
repeat length times
	set num to (random number from 1 to (count of complex_letters)) -- generate random number for complexity
	set letters to (item num of complex_letters) -- get complex letters at generated number index
	set pos to (random number from 1 to (length of letters)) -- get random position in letters
	set random_letter to (character pos of letters) -- get random character in letters
	set password to password & random_letter -- add random character to password
end repeat

(* Print password *)
set T to "The generated password of length " & length & " is " & password & "."
log T
