# This code snippet creates a function that checks if a given number is a prime number
function isPrime(num)
	set i to 2 # starting at 2 because 1 and 0 are not prime numbers

	# loop through all numbers from 2 to half of the given number
	repeat with j from 2 to num / 2
		# if the given number is divisible by any number in the loop, it is not a prime number
		if num mod j = 0 then 
			return false # exit the function and return false
		end if
	end repeat

	return true # if the number is not divisible by any number in the loop, it is a prime number
end isPrime

# Example call of the function
set n to 13
if isPrime(n) then
	display dialog n & " is a prime number." # outputs "13 is a prime number."
else
	display dialog n & " is not a prime number." # this line will not be executed
end if
