-- This code snippet uses AppleScript to create a list of names and their corresponding ages

-- Initialize list of names
set namesList to {"John", "Emily", "Michael", "Sophia", "David"}

-- Initialize list of ages
set ageList to {25, 30, 28, 26, 33}

-- Create empty list to store name-age pairs
set nameAgeList to {}

-- Use repeat loop to iterate through namesList and ageList simultaneously
repeat with i from 1 to length of namesList

    -- Create a temporary list to store name-age pair
    set temp to {}

    -- Set name and age variables from respective lists
    set name to item i of namesList
    set age to item i of ageList

    -- Append name and age to temporary list
    set end of temp to name
    set end of temp to age

    -- Append temporary list to nameAgeList to create list of name-age pairs
    set end of nameAgeList to temp

end repeat

-- Print list of name-age pairs
log nameAgeList
