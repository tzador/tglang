set namesList to {"John", "Jane", "Jack", "Jill"} -- creates a list of names
set agesList to {25, 28, 32, 30} -- creates a list of ages
set infosList to {{namesList, "Male", agesList}, {"Jane", "Female", 28}} -- creates a nested list with names, gender and ages
set gender to "Male" -- sets a variable for gender
set age to 30 -- sets a variable for age

repeat with i from 1 to length of infosList -- repeats the following code for each item in the nested list
	if (first item of (first item of infosList) = gender) and (second item of (first item of infosList) >= age) then -- checks if the gender and age match the criteria
		set matchedName to name of infosList -- sets a variable for the name that meets the criteria
		display dialog "Found match:" & matchedName -- displays a message with the matched name
		exit repeat -- exits the repeat loop
	end if
end repeat

return matchedName -- returns the matched name from the nested list, if no match is found it will return a blank value
