--A script that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
--Input: A positive integer
--Output: The Fibonacci sequence up to the given number

--Define a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence
on calculateFibonacci(n)
	set sequence to {1, 1} --Initialize the sequence with the first two numbers
	set previousNumber to 1 --Initialize the previous number
	set currentNumber to 1 --Initialize the current number
	set nextNumber to 0 --Initialize the next number, will be used to store the calculated number

	--Iterate through the sequence until the current number is equal to or greater than the given number
	repeat while currentNumber < n
		set nextNumber to previousNumber + currentNumber --Calculate the next number in the sequence
		set previousNumber to currentNumber --Update the previous number to be the current number
		set currentNumber to nextNumber --Update the current number to be the calculated number
		set the end of sequence to nextNumber --Add the calculated number to the sequence
	end repeat
	
	return sequence --Return the completed sequence
end calculateFibonacci

--Prompt the user to input a positive integer
display dialog "Enter a positive integer:" default answer ""

--Store the user input in a variable
set input to text returned of result

--Convert the user input to a number
set n to input as number

--Call the calculateFibonacci function and store the result in a variable
set fibonacciSequence to calculateFibonacci(n)

--Display the Fibonacci sequence as a dialog message
display dialog "The Fibonacci sequence up to " & n & " is " & fibonacciSequence
