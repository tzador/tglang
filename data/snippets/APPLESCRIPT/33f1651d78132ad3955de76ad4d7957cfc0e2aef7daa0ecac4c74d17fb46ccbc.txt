--This script checks if the user is currently running Safari and, if so, moves the active tab to a new window
--First, we use a tell block to specify which application we want to target, in this case, Safari
tell application "Safari"
    --Next, we check if Safari is currently running by using an if statement and the "running" property
    if it running then
        --If Safari is running, we then check if there is an active tab open
        if (count of tabs of window 1) > 0 then
            --If there is an active tab, we get the URL of the active tab
            set activeURL to URL of current tab of window 1
            --Next, we create a new window using the "make new document" command
            set newWin to make new document
            --Then, we set the URL of the new window to the URL of the active tab
            set URL of newWin to activeURL
            --Finally, we close the active tab in the original window
            close current tab of window 1
