-- Set variables
set num1 to 15
set num2 to 10
set num3 to 2

-- Calculate average
set average to (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3

-- Print result
log "The average is " & average

-- Check if average is greater than 10
if average > 10 then
  -- Subtract 5 and print result
  set new_average to average - 5
  log "The new average is " & new_average
else
  -- Add 5 and print result
  set new_average to average + 5
  log "The new average is " & new_average
end if

-- Loop through a list of numbers
repeat with i from 1 to 10
  if i mod 2 = 0 then
    -- If number is even, add 10 to average
    set new_average to new_average + 10
  else
    -- If number is odd, subtract 10 from average
    set new_average to new_average - 10
  end if
end repeat

-- Print final average
log "The final average is " & new_average

-- Display a dialog box with the final average
display dialog "The final average is " & new_average with title "Final Average" buttons {"OK"}
