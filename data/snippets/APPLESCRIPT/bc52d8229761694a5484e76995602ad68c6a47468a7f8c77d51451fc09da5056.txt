-- Use the count command to get the total number of quotes in the list
set totalQuotes to count of quoteList

-- Use the random number command to generate a random number between 1 and the total number of quotes
set randomNum to (random number from 1 to totalQuotes)

-- Use the item command to get the quote at the randomly generated index
set randomQuote to item randomNum of quoteList
