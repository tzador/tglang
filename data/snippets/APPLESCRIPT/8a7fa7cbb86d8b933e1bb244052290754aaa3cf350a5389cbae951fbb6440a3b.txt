set password to "p@$$w0rd" -- Replace "p@$$w0rd" with desired password
set passwordLength to count characters of password -- Get length of password

set uppercaseChars to 0
set lowercaseChars to 0
set numbers to 0

-- Loop through each character in password and check for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
repeat with i from 1 to passwordLength
	set char to character i of password
