### First, we define a function to get the current date in a specific format
on getCurrentDate()
	set currentDate to (current date)
	set day of currentDate to 2 digits
	set month of currentDate to 2 digits
	set year of currentDate to 4 digits
	set formattedDate to (currentDate as string)
	return formattedDate
end getCurrentDate

### Next, we set a variable to the current date
set currentDate to getCurrentDate()

### Then, we define a list of fruits to choose from
set fruitsList to {"apple", "banana", "orange", "strawberry", "blueberry"}

### We use the 'choose from list' command to display the list for user selection
set selectedFruit to choose from list fruitsList with prompt "Select a fruit:"

### If the user didn't make a selection, we display a message and end the script
if selectedFruit is false then
	display alert "No fruit selected. Program will now end."
end if

### Otherwise, we continue and set the selected fruit as a variable
set fruit to item 1 of selectedFruit

### We create a new string using the selected fruit and the current date
set newString to "Today's fruit of choice is " & fruit & ", on " & currentDate

### Finally, we display a dialog with the new string
display dialog newString with title "Fruit of the Day" buttons {"Close"} default button "Close"
