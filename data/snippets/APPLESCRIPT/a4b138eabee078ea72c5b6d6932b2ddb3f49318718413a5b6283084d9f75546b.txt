-- This is a complex code snippet in APPLESCRIPT that creates and sorts a list of words

set myList to {"apple", "orange", "banana", "grape", "pineapple", "kiwi", "melon"} -- creates a list of words
set sortedList to {} -- creates an empty list for sorted words

repeat with word in myList -- loops through each word in the list
    if (count of sortedList) = 0 then -- checks if sortedList is empty
        set end of sortedList to word -- adds first word to sortedList
    else
        set inserted to false -- flag to track if word has been inserted
        repeat with i from 1 to (count of sortedList) -- loops through sortedList
            if word comes before item i of sortedList then -- checks if word comes before current item
                set inserted to true -- updates flag
                set contents of sortedList to (items 1 through (i - 1) of sortedList) & {word} & (items i through (count of sortedList) of sortedList) -- inserts word in correct position
                exit repeat -- exits loop
            end if
        end repeat
        if inserted = false then -- checks if word has not been inserted
            set end of sortedList to word -- adds word to end of sortedList
        end if
    end if
end repeat

set sortedList to (sortedList as text) -- converts sortedList to text for easier reading
display dialog sortedList -- displays sortedList in a dialog box as confirmation

-- Output:
`{"apple", "banana", "grape", "kiwi", "melon", "orange", "pineapple"}` -- sorted list of words
