(* This is a basic applescript code snippet that creates a list of strings and loops through it, printing each item along with its index in the list. *)

set myList to {"apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"}

repeat with i from 1 to count of myList
	set currentItem to item i of myList
	set index to i
	display dialog "The item at index " & index & " is " & currentItem
end repeat

(* Output:
"The item at index 1 is apple"
"The item at index 2 is banana"
"The item at index 3 is orange"
"The item at index 4 is grape"
*)
