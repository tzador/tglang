-- This code snippet calculates the average temperature of a given set of data

set temperatureList to {74, 65, 82, 68, 70} -- data set

set sum to 0 -- variable for storing the sum

set len to (count of temperatureList) -- variable for storing the length of the list

repeat with i from 1 to len -- loop through the list
	set sum to sum + item i of temperatureList -- add each temperature to the sum
end repeat

set averageTemperature to (sum / len) -- calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length

-- Output the average temperature
