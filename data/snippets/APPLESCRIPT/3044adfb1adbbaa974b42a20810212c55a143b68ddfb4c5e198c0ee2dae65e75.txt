set inputList to {5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 9} -- list of numbers to be sorted
set outputList to {} -- initialize empty list for sorted numbers

-- insertion sort algorithm
repeat with i from 1 to count of inputList
	set currentItem to item i of inputList
	set j to i - 1
	repeat while j â‰¥ 0 and (item j of inputList) > currentItem
		set item j + 1 of inputList to (item j of inputList)
		set j to j - 1
