(*
This code snippet uses AppleScript to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.
The code takes in a number from the user and outputs the factorial of that number.

on factorial(num)
    (*This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number*)
    if num = 0 then
        return 1
    else
        return num * factorial(num - 1)
    end if
end factorial

set userNum to text returned of (display dialog "Enter a number:" default answer "") as integer

if userNum â‰¥ 0 then
    set resultNum to factorial(userNum)
    display dialog "The factorial of " & userNum & " is " & resultNum
else
    display dialog "Please enter a non-negative number."
end if

Sample output:
The factorial of 5 is 120
