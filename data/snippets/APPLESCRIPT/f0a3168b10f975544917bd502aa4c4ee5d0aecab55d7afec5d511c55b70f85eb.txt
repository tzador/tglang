-- This code snippet generates a random number between 1 and 10 and then prints a message based on the number.

set randomNumber to (random number from 1 to 10) -- generates a random number

if randomNumber is less than 5 then -- check if the number is less than 5
    display dialog "The number is less than 5." -- print a message
else if randomNumber is greater than 5 then -- check if the number is greater than 5
    display dialog "The number is greater than 5." -- print a different message
else -- if the number is exactly 5
    display dialog "The number is 5." -- print another message
end if
