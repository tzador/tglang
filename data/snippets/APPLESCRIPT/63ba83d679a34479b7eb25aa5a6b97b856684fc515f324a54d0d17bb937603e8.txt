(* This code snippet is a complex script that takes in user input and performs various operations on it. *)

-- Prompt for user input
display dialog Â¬
"Enter a string of numbers separated by spaces: " default answer ""

-- Store input in a variable
set userInput to text returned of result

-- Split the input into a list of strings
set inputList to every paragraph of userInput

-- Loop through each string in the list
repeat with i from 1 to count of inputList
	-- Convert string to number
	set currentNum to item i of inputList as number
	
	-- Perform operations on the number
	set multipliedNum to currentNum * 2
	set squaredNum to currentNum ^ 2
	set reversedNum to (reverse of characters of (currentNum as text)) as number
	
	-- Print out the results
	log "Original number: " & currentNum
	log "Multiplied by 2: " & multipliedNum
	log "Squared: " & squaredNum
	log "Reversed: " & reversedNum
	
	-- Calculate the sum of the three results
	set sumNum to currentNum + multipliedNum + squaredNum
	log "Sum of results: " & sumNum
	
	-- Display a notification with the sum
	display notification "Sum of results is " & sumNum
end repeat

-- Display a dialog with final message
display dialog "Calculations complete. Check the results in the Script Editor's log." buttons {"OK"} default button "OK"
