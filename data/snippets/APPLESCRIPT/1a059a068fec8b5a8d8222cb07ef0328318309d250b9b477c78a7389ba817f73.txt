(* This is a complex script that calculates the total cost of purchasing different items. *)

(* Creating a list of items and their respective prices *)
set items to {"Apple", "Orange", "Banana"}
set prices to {1.99, 0.99, 0.79}

(* Defining a function to calculate the total cost *)
on calculateTotalCost(itemList, priceList)
	set totalCost to 0
	
	(* Looping through the items and adding their prices to the total cost *)
	repeat with i from 1 to length of itemList
		set itemName to item i of itemList
		set itemPrice to item i of priceList
		set totalCost to totalCost + itemPrice
		
		(* Printing the current item and its price for reference *)
		log ("Item " & i & ": " & itemName & ", Price: $" & itemPrice)
	end repeat
	
	(* Returning the total cost *)
	return totalCost
end calculateTotalCost

(* Calling the function with our list of items and prices *)
set total to calculateTotalCost(items, prices)

(* Printing the final total cost *)
log ("Total cost of all items: $" & total)

(* Output:
Item 1: Apple, Price: $1.99
Item 2: Orange, Price: $0.99
Item 3: Banana, Price: $0.79
Total cost of all items: $3.77
