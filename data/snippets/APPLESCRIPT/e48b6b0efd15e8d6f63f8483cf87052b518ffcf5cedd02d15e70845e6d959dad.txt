            set align to "center" -- set the variable 'align' to "center"
        else -- if the document's alignment is not set to right or center, set it to left
            set align to "left" -- set the variable 'align' to "left"
        end if -- end if block
        set size to (count of words of theRange) * 12 -- calculate the size of the document based on the number of words, and set it as variable 'size'
        if size < 100 then -- check if the size is less than 100
            set size to 100 -- if it is, set the size to 100
        else if size > 500 then -- check if the size is more than 500
            set size to 500 -- if it is, set the size to 500

        set theFont to font name of range of theRange -- set the font of the document as variable 'theFont'
        set fileName to name of theDoc -- set the name of the document as variable 'fileName'
        if fileName contains ":" then -- check if the document's name has a colon in it

        else -- if it doesn't, just use the original file name
            set saveName to fileName
        end if -- end if block
