(* This program calculates the factorial of a given number *)
(* We begin by declaring a variable to store the given number *)
set inputNumber to 5

(* Next, we declare a variable to store the result of the factorial *)
set factorial to 1

(* We use a repeat loop to iterate through all the numbers from 1 to the given number *)
repeat with i from 1 to inputNumber
    (* At each iteration, we multiply the current factorial value with the current number *)
    set factorial to factorial * i
end repeat

(* Finally, we print the result of the factorial calculation *)
