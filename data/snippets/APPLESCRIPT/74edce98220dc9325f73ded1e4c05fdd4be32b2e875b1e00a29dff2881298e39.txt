(*
This code snippet generates a random password that includes letters, numbers, and symbols.

Requirements:
- None

Output:
- A random password string of length 12

Logic:
1. Create a list of all possible characters to include in the password
2. Generate a random index number within the length of the character list
3. Append the character at the generated index to the password string
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a total of 12 characters
5. Output the final password string

(* List of all possible characters *)
set characterList to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789~!@#$%^&*()_+=-][}{;:<>,./?|"

(* Initialize an empty password string *)
set password to ""

(* Generate a random index number and append the corresponding character to the password string *)
repeat 12 times
	set randomIndex to (random number from 1 to (count characters of characterList))
	set password to password & character (randomIndex) of characterList
end repeat

(* Output the final password *)
return password
