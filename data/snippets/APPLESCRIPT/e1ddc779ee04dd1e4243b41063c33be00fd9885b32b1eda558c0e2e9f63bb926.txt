	-- Add the number to the list.
	set end of random_numbers to random_num
end repeat

-- Calculate the sum of the numbers in the list.
set sum to 0
repeat with num in random_numbers
    set sum to sum + num
end repeat

-- Calculate the average of the numbers in the list.
set average to sum / N

-- Print the list, sum and average to the user.
display dialog "List: " & random_numbers & return & "Sum: " & sum & return & "Average: " & average
