-- This is a complex code snippet in APPLESCRIPT
-- It will create a new calendar event with a title, location, start date, end date, and attendees
-- First, we ask the user for the event information
display dialog "Please enter the event title:" default answer ""
set eventTitle to (text returned of result)
display dialog "Please enter the event location:" default answer ""
set eventLocation to (text returned of result)
display dialog "Please enter the start date (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM):" default answer ""
set startDate to (date (text returned of result))
display dialog "Please enter the end date (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM):" default answer ""
set endDate to (date (text returned of result))
display dialog "Please enter the email addresses of the attendees (separated by commas):" default answer ""
set attendeeEmails to (text returned of result)
set attendeeList to {}
-- Next, we split the email addresses into a list and loop through them to create an attendee record for each
repeat with i from 1 to the count of words in attendeeEmails by 2
    set emailStart to i
    set emailEnd to (i + 1)
    set currentEmail to words emailStart thru emailEnd of attendeeEmails as string
    set end of attendeeList to {emailAddress:currentEmail}
end repeat
-- Finally, we use the create event command to generate the new event in the calendar app
tell application "Calendar"
    tell calendar "Home" -- Change this to the desired calendar name
        set newEvent to make new event with properties {summary:eventTitle, location:eventLocation, start date:startDate, end date:endDate, attendees:attendeeList}
    end tell
end tell
