-- This code snippet shows how to create a more complex file renaming script in AppleScript

-- Set the folder path to the location of the files that need to be renamed
set folderPath to "Users:Username:Documents:Files"

-- Get all files in the specified folder
set fileList to paragraphs of (do shell script "ls " & quoted form of POSIX path of folderPath)

-- Variable to keep track of the current file number
set fileNumber to 1

-- Repeat for each file in the list
repeat with currentFile in fileList
    -- Get the file extension by splitting the file name at the last period
    set fileExtension to (reverse of every character of (text items 1 thru -2 of (reverse of currentFile) as string) as string)
    
    -- Create a new file name with the current file number and file extension
    set newFileName to fileNumber & "." & fileExtension
    
    -- Set the file path for the old and new file names
    set oldFilePath to folderPath & ":" & currentFile
    set newFilePath to folderPath & ":" & newFileName
    
    -- Rename the file and increment the file number
    do shell script "mv " & quoted form of POSIX path of oldFilePath & " " & quoted form of POSIX path of newFilePath
    set fileNumber to fileNumber + 1
end repeat

-- Notify user that the task is complete
display dialog "All files have been renamed successfully!" buttons {"OK"} default button "OK"
