-- This code snippet uses the Applescript language to manipulate data in a Numbers spreadsheet.

-- First, we need to set the targetFile variable to the file path of the Numbers spreadsheet we want to manipulate.
set targetFile to "Users:example:Documents:Spreadsheet.numbers"

-- Next, we open the Numbers application and activate it.
tell application "Numbers"
	activate
-- Then, we open the target spreadsheet and set it as the active document.
	open targetFile
	set targetSpreadsheet to the active sheet of the active document

-- Now, we can begin manipulating data in the spreadsheet. In this example, we will add a new column called "Total" and calculate the sum of two existing columns.
	tell table "Table 1" of targetSpreadsheet
		tell column "Column 1"
			make new column with properties {header name:"Total"}
			tell cells
				repeat with i from 1 to count
					set cellValue to value of cell i
					set cellValue to cellValue + value of cell i in column "Column 2"
					set value of cell i in column "Total" to cellValue
				end repeat
			end tell
		end tell

-- Finally, we save the changes made to the spreadsheet.
	save active document
end tell
