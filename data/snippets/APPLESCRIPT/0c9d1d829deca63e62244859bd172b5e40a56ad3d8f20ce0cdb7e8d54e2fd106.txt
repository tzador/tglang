--This code snippet creates a list of numbers and squares each number in the list

set numbersList to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} --set the list of numbers
set squaredList to {} --set the empty list for storing squared numbers

--use repeat loop to iterate through the numbers list
repeat with num in numbersList
    set squaredNum to num ^ 2 --square the number
    
    --use if statement to check if the squared number is even or odd
    if squaredNum mod 2 = 0 then 
        set numberType to "even" --if even, set numberType variable to "even"
    else
        set numberType to "odd" --if odd, set numberType variable to "odd"
    end if
    
    --add the squared number and its type to the squared list
    set squaredItem to {"Number: " & num, "Squared: " & squaredNum, "Type: " & numberType}
    set end of squaredList to squaredItem
end repeat

return squaredList --return the list of squared numbers and their types
