(* This code snippet uses AppleScript to automate creating a new email in the Apple Mail application on macOS.

It first checks if the Mail application is running, and if it is not, then it opens the application.
Next, it creates a new outgoing message with the subject, recipients, and body specified by the user.
Then it sends the email and displays a confirmation message. *)

(* Checking if the Mail application is running *)
tell application "System Events"
	set isMailRunning to count (every process whose name is "Mail")
end tell

(* Opening the Mail application if it is not already open *)
if isMailRunning is 0 then
	tell application "Mail" to activate
end if

(* Getting user input for the new email *)
set subject to text returned of (display dialog "Enter email subject:" default answer "")
set recipients to text returned of (display dialog "Enter email recipients separated by commas:" default answer "")
set body to text returned of (display dialog "Enter email body:" default answer "")

(* Creating a new outgoing message *)
tell application "Mail"
	set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:subject, content:body}
	
	(* Adding recipients to the message *)
	repeat with recipient in recipients
		make new recipient at newMessage with properties {address:recipient}
	end repeat
	
	(* Sending the email *)
	send newMessage
	
	(* Displaying a confirmation message *)
	display dialog "Email sent successfully!" buttons {"OK"} default button "OK"
end tell
