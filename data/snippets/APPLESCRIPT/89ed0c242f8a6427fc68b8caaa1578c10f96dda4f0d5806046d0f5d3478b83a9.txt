--This code snippet takes a list of numbers and squares each number
set numbersList to {3, 7, 14, -2} --create a list of numbers
set squaredList to {} --create an empty list for squared numbers

repeat with i from 1 to count of numbersList --loop through the numbers list
 set currentNumber to item i of numbersList --get the current number
 set squaredNumber to currentNumber * currentNumber --square the number
 copy squaredNumber to the end of squaredList --add the squared number to the squared list
end repeat

return squaredList --return the squared list as the output
