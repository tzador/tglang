(* This is a complex code snippet in the APPLESCRIPT programming language.
It takes user input and creates a list with multiple items, then loops through the list and performs calculations based on user-defined conditions. *)

set userInput to text returned of (display dialog "Enter a list of numbers, separated by commas:" default answer "")
set inputList to every text item of userInput

(* Calculate sum and average of numbers in list *)
set sum to 0
repeat with num in inputList
    try
        set sum to sum + (num as number)
    end try
end repeat
set average to sum / (count inputList)

(* Create a list with only even numbers *)
set evenList to {}
repeat with num in inputList
    try
        if (num as number) mod 2 is equal to 0 then
            set end of evenList to num
        end if
    end try
end repeat

(* Calculate product of even numbers in list *)
set product to 1
repeat with num in evenList
    set product to product * num
end repeat

(* Display results to user *)
display dialog "Sum of numbers: " & sum & return & "Average of numbers: " & average & return & "Product of even numbers: " & product
