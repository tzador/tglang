(*
This code snippet is written in Applescript and it creates a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
*)

(*
The first line declares the beginning of the function and gives it a name ("factorial").
The next line declares the input variable (n).
*)
on factorial(n)

(*
The third line checks if the input number is 0 or 1.
If it is, the function returns 1.
*)
if n = 0 or n = 1 then
return 1

(*
The next line creates a variable called "result" and sets it to equal 1.
*)
set result to 1

(*
The "repeat" block starts a loop to calculate the factorial.
The loop will run from 2 up to the input number.
Each iteration, the result variable is multiplied by the current number.
*)
repeat with i from 2 to n
set result to result * i
end repeat

(*
The last line of the function returns the final result.
*)
return result

(*
To test the function, we can call it with a sample input (5) and print the result.
*)
factorial(5)
(* output: 120 *)
