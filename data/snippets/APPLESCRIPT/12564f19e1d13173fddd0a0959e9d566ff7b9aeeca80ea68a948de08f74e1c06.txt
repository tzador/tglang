-- This is a long and complex AppleScript snippet
-- that performs various actions and calculations.
-- It includes loops, conditionals, and error handling.

-- Define variables and set their initial values
set variable1 to 0
set variable2 to 1
set variable3 to ""

-- Loop through a list and perform calculations
repeat with i from 1 to 10
    set variable1 to variable1 + i
    set variable2 to variable2 * i
end repeat

-- Check if a condition is met and respond accordingly
if variable1 > variable2 then
    set variable3 to "Variable 1 is greater than variable 2"
else
    set variable3 to "Variable 1 is less than or equal to variable 2"
end if

-- Handle errors and display a notification
try
    set variable4 to variable1 / 0
on error errMessage
    display notification "An error occurred: " & errMessage
end try

-- Output the results in a dialog box
display dialog "The final value of variable3 is: " & variable3 & " and the final value of variable4 is: " & variable4
