-- Define a list of ages for the group of people
set ages to {31, 27, 35, 42, 18}

-- Initialize a variable to store the sum of all ages
set sum to 0

-- Loop through the list of ages
repeat with i from 1 to count of ages

-- Add each age to the sum variable
set sum to sum + item i of ages

end repeat

-- Calculate the average age by dividing the sum by the number of people
set averageAge to sum / (count of ages)

-- Convert the average age to a string
set averageAgeStr to (averageAge as string)

-- Display an alert with the average age
display alert "The average age of the group is " & averageAgeStr
