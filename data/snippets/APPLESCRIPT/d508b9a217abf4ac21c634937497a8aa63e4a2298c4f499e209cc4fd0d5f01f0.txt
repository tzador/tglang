--The following code snippet creates a list of numbers and prints the sum of all even numbers in the list

set numbersList to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} --create a list of numbers
set sum to 0 --set initial value of sum to 0

repeat with num in numbersList --loop through each number in the list
    if (num mod 2) = 0 then --check if the number is even
        set sum to sum + num --add the number to the sum if it is even
    end if
end repeat

log "The sum of all even numbers in the list is " & sum --print the sum of even numbers
