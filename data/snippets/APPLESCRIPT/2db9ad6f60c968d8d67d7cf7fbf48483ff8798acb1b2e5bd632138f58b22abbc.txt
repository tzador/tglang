(* This code snippet creates a script that counts the number of words in a given string. *)
set inputString to "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

-- split the string by spaces into a list
set wordList to words of inputString

-- get the length of the list
set wordCount to count of wordList

-- check if there is only one word and change grammar accordingly
if wordCount = 1 then
	set grammar to "word"
else
	set grammar to "words"
end if

-- print the final output
log "The string '" & inputString & "' has " & wordCount & " " & grammar & " in it"

-- output: The string 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' has 9 words in it
