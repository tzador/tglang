-- This is a code snippet that will generate a random password with user-inputted parameters
--
-- The following code will prompt the user for the minimum length of the password
-- and the number of special characters to include
--
-- It will then generate a password with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters,
-- numbers, and special characters
--
-- Set the minimum length of the password
display dialog "Enter minimum length for password:" default answer ""
set minLength to text returned of result
-- Set the number of special characters to include
display dialog "Enter number of special characters to include:" default answer ""
set numSpecialChars to text returned of result
-- Set the possible characters for the password
set possibleCharacters to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*()"
-- Define a function to generate a random password with given length
on generatePassword(passwordLength)
	set password to ""
	repeat with i from 1 to passwordLength
		-- Get a random character from the possible characters
		set randomCharacter to character (random number from 1 to (length of possibleCharacters)) of possibleCharacters
		-- Add the character to the password
		set password to password & randomCharacter
	end repeat
	return password
end generatePassword
-- Generate the password with the given length and number of special characters
set password to generatePassword(minLength + numSpecialChars)
-- Get the special characters to include
set specialCharacters to characters -minLength-thru -1 of password
-- Replace the special characters with random special characters
repeat with i from 1 to (length of specialCharacters)
	-- Get a random special character from the possible special characters
	set randomSpecialCharacter to character (random number from 1 to (length of possibleCharacters)) Â¬
		of possibleCharacters
	-- Set the special character to the random special character
	set item i of specialCharacters to randomSpecialCharacter
end repeat
-- Convert the special characters list back to a string and append to the password
set specialCharsString to specialCharacters as string
set password to password & specialCharsString
-- Shuffle the password using the Fisher-Yates algorithm
set passwordLength to length of password
repeat with i from passwordLength to 2 by -1
	set j to random number from 1 to i
	if j is less than or equal to i then
		set charA to character j of password
		set character j of password to character i of password
		set character i of password to charA
	end if
end repeat
-- Display the generated password to the user
display dialog "Your generated password is:" & return & password
