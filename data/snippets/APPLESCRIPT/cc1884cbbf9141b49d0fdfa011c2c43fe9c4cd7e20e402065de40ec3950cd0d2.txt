-- This program demonstrates nested functions and control flow in Applescript
on add_numbers(num1, num2)
    -- A function to add two numbers together
    return num1 + num2
end add_numbers

on multiply_numbers(num1, num2)
    -- A function to multiply two numbers together
    return num1 * num2
end multiply_numbers

on calculate_average(numlist)
    -- A function to calculate the average of a list of numbers
    set listlength to length of numlist
    set sum to 0
    repeat with i from 1 to listlength
        set sum to sum + (item i of numlist)
    end repeat
    return sum / listlength
end calculate_average

-- Main program
set first_num to 5
set second_num to 10
set third_num to 15

-- Call the add_numbers function and store the result in a variable
set sum_result to add_numbers(first_num, second_num)
-- Print out the result
display dialog "The sum of " & first_num & " and " & second_num & " is " & sum_result

-- Call the multiply_numbers function and store the result in a variable
set product_result to multiply_numbers(second_num, third_num)
-- Print out the result
display dialog "The product of " & second_num & " and " & third_num & " is " & product_result

-- Create a list of numbers and call the calculate_average function to find the average
set numlist to {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}
set avg_result to calculate_average(numlist)
-- Print out the result
display dialog "The average of the numbers " & (numlist as text) & " is " & avg_result
