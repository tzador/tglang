(* This program is a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division *)

-- Prompts user to choose operation
display dialog "Choose an operation: " buttons {"Addition", "Subtraction", "Multiplication", "Division"} default button 2

-- Sets operation variable based on user's choice
set operationChoice to button returned of the result

-- Prompts user to enter two numbers to compute
set firstNumber to text returned of (display dialog "Enter first number: " default answer "")
set secondNumber to text returned of (display dialog "Enter second number: " default answer "")

-- Converts numbers to integers
set firstNumber to firstNumber as integer
set secondNumber to secondNumber as integer

-- Performs calculation based on user's choice and displays result
if operationChoice is "Addition" then
	set result to firstNumber + secondNumber
	display dialog "Result: " & result buttons {"OK"} default button 1
else if operationChoice is "Subtraction" then
	set result to firstNumber - secondNumber
	display dialog "Result: " & result buttons {"OK"} default button 1
else if operationChoice is "Multiplication" then
	set result to firstNumber * secondNumber
	display dialog "Result: " & result buttons {"OK"} default button 1
else if operationChoice is "Division" then
	set result to firstNumber / secondNumber
	display dialog "Result: " & result buttons {"OK"} default button 1
