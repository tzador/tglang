-- This is a code snippet in Applescript that creates a numbered list
-- of fruits and their corresponding prices
set fruits to {"Apple", "Banana", "Pineapple", "Mango"} -- list of fruits
set prices to {"$1.00", "$2.50", "$3.75", "$4.25"} -- list of prices
set counter to 1 -- counter for numbering
repeat with i from 1 to length of fruits -- loop through each fruit
    set fruit to item i of fruits -- get current fruit
    set price to item i of prices -- get corresponding price
    set list_entry to (counter & ". " & fruit & ": " & price) -- create list entry in format "1. Fruit: Price"
    log list_entry -- print list entry
    set counter to counter + 1 -- increment counter
end repeat
