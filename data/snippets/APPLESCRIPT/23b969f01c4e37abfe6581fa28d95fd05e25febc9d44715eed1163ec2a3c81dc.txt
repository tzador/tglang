--This code snippet generates a random password with the given length
set passwordLength to 10 --change the value to adjust the length of the password
set passwordCharacters to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_-+!@#$%^&*()[]{}" --all possible characters for the password
set possibleLength to length of passwordCharacters --determining the length of the character pool
set password to "" --empty string variable to store the generated password

repeat with i from 1 to passwordLength --loop to generate characters for password
	set randomIndex to random number from 1 to possibleLength --randomly selecting an index from the character pool
	set password to password & character randomIndex of passwordCharacters --appending the character to the password string
end repeat

return password --outputting the generated password
