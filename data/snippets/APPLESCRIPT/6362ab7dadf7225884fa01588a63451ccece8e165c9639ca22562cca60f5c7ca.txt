(* This program is a simple calculator *)

-- Define the operations available
set operations to {"add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"}

-- Ask user for operation
set operation to (choose from list operations with prompt "Please select an operation:")

-- Ask user for numbers
set num1 to text returned of (display dialog "Please enter the first number:" default answer "")
set num2 to text returned of (display dialog "Please enter the second number:" default answer "")

-- Convert numbers to integers
set num1 to num1 as integer
set num2 to num2 as integer

-- Perform calculation based on operation selected
if operation = "add" then
    set result to num1 + num2
else if operation = "subtract" then
    set result to num1 - num2
else if operation = "multiply" then
    set result to num1 * num2
else if operation = "divide" then
    set result to num1 / num2
end if

-- Display result
display dialog "The result is: " & result as text buttons {"OK"} default button "OK"
