-- AppleScript code for selecting random items from a list

-- Initializing the list
set itemList to {"apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"}

-- Getting the length of the list
set listLength to count of itemList

-- Converting the list indices to random numbers
set randomIndex1 to (random number from 1 to listLength)
set randomIndex2 to (random number from 1 to listLength)

-- Ensuring that the two random numbers are different
repeat while randomIndex1 = randomIndex2
	set randomIndex2 to (random number from 1 to listLength)
end repeat

-- Selecting items at random indices from the list
set selectedItem1 to item randomIndex1 of itemList
set selectedItem2 to item randomIndex2 of itemList

-- Displaying the selected items
display dialog "The randomly selected items are " & selectedItem1 & " and " & selectedItem2
