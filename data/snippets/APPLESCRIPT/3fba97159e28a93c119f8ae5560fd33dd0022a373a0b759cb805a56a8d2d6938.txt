-- This code snippet converts a given string into uppercase
set inputString to "Hello, World!" -- change this to any desired string
set outputString to ""
set stringLength to count of characters of inputString
repeat with i from 1 to stringLength
	set currentChar to character i of inputString
	if currentChar ≥ "a" and currentChar ≤ "z" then -- checks if character is lowercase
		tell currentChar to set ASCII to its ASCII number
		set uppercaseChar to ASCII - 32 -- converts ASCII to uppercase equivalent
		set currentChar to character id uppercaseChar of currentChar
	end if
	set outputString to outputString & currentChar
