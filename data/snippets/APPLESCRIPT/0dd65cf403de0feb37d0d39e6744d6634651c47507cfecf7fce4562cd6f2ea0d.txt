-- This is an AppleScript code snippet that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list

set numList to {2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 3, 6, 9} -- A list of numbers
set evenList to {} -- A list to hold the even numbers
set sum to 0 -- A variable to hold the sum of even numbers

repeat with num in numList
	if num mod 2 is equal to 0 then -- Checking if the number is even by finding the remainder when divided by 2
		set end of evenList to num -- Adding the number to the even list
	end if
end repeat

repeat with evenNum in evenList
	set sum to sum + evenNum -- Adding the even numbers from the even list to the sum variable
end repeat

return "The sum of even numbers in the list is " & sum -- Returning the sum of even numbers as a string
