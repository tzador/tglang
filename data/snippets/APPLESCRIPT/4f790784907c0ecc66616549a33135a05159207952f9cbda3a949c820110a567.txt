-- This is a complex code snippet in the APPLESCRIPT programming language.
-- It generates a random number from 1 to 10 using a while loop and prints it.
set randomNum to 0 -- initialize variable
set counter to 0 -- initialize counter

-- the while loop will run until a value between 1 and 10 is generated
while randomNum < 1 or randomNum > 10
  -- generate a random number using the 'random number from' function
  set randomNum to random number from 1 to 10
  -- increase the counter by 1 with each iteration of the loop
  set counter to counter + 1
end while

-- print the final random number and the number of times it took to generate it
display dialog "Random number generated: " & randomNum & " after " & counter & " attempts."
