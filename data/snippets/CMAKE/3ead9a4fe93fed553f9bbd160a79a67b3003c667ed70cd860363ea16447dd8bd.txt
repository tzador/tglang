## Creates a library target
add_library(my_lib SHARED             ## Sets the target name and type (in this case, shared library)
            src/file1.cxx             ## Specifies the source files to be compiled

            include/my_lib.h)         ## Specifies the header files to be included for compilation

## Sets the properties of the library target

## Specifies the include directories for compilation
target_include_directories(my_lib PUBLIC include)  ## Sets the "PUBLIC" interface include directories (accessible to users of the library)
target_include_directories(my_lib PRIVATE src)    ## Sets the "PRIVATE" implementation include directories (only accessible within the library)

## Specifies the libraries to be linked to the target
target_link_libraries(my_lib PUBLIC pthread)       ## Links the "PUBLIC" interface to the pthread library
target_link_libraries(my_lib PRIVATE ${CMAKE_DL_LIBS})  ## Links the "PRIVATE" implementation to the dynamic loader library

## Specifies the compiler flags to be used for compilation
target_compile_options(my_lib PRIVATE
