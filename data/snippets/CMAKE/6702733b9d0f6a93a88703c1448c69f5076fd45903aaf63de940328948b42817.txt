#This is a CMake snippet
#It sets up a custom build target that compiles a C++ program with custom flags and libraries included
#The output target will be named "myProgram"

#Specify the minimum required version of CMake

#Set the name of the project
project(myProgram)

#Set the C++ standard to C++17

    ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
)

#Add custom library directories
link_directories(
    ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib
