//This code snippet is a function that finds the smallest number in an array
function findSmallestNum(arr) {
  let smallest = arr[0]; //sets initial value as first element in array
  for (let num of arr) { //loops through each element in array
    if (num < smallest) { //compares current number to smallest
      smallest = num; //if current number is smaller, it becomes the new smallest
    }
  }
  return smallest; //returns smallest number in array
}

//example call of function with an array
let numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 0, 3]; 
findSmallestNum(numbers); //outputs 0 as it is the smallest number in the array
