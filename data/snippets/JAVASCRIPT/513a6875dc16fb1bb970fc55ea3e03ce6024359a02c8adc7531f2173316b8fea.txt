/*
This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

Input: num - number whose factorial is to be calculated
Output: factorial of num

Explanation:
The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 up to and including that number.
For example, the factorial of 3 (denoted as 3!) is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.

This function uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 up to and including the input number.
The factorial variable is initialized to 1, as 1 is the identity element for multiplication.
Each iteration, the factorial variable is multiplied by the current number.
Once the loop is finished, the factorial variable will hold the factorial of the input number, which is then returned as the output.

function factorial(num) {
    let factorial = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
        factorial *= i;
    }
    return factorial;
}

factorial(5); // returns 120 (5! = 5*4*3*2*1)
