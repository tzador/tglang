// Define a function called "calculateTotal" that takes in two parameters, 
// "amount" and "taxPercentage", and returns the total amount with added tax.

function calculateTotal(amount, taxPercentage) {
    // Declare a variable "taxAmount" and assign it the value of "amount" multiplied by "taxPercentage".
    const taxAmount = amount * taxPercentage;
    // Declare a variable "totalAmount" and assign it the value of "amount" plus "taxAmount".
    const totalAmount = amount + taxAmount;
    // Return the value of "totalAmount".
    return totalAmount;
}

// Call the function "calculateTotal" and pass in the amount of 1000 and a tax percentage of 0.1.
calculateTotal(1000, 0.1); // Output: 1100
