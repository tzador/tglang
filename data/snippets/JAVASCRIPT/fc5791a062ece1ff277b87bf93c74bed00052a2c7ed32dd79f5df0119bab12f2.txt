//This code snippet is a function in JavaScript that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers after performing some calculations

function sumNumbers (numbers) {
    //initialize variables
    let sum = 0; //variable to hold sum of numbers
    let count = 0; //variable to keep track of number of iterations

    //loop through array
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        //multiply current number by 2
        let num = numbers[i] * 2;

        //check if number is even
        if (num % 2 === 0) {
            //if even, add it to the sum
            sum += num;
        } else {
            //if odd, subtract it from the sum
            sum -= num;
        }

        //increment count
        count++;
    }

    //return sum
    return sum;
}

//sample array of numbers
let numbers = [1, 3, 5, 9, 12, 20];

//call the function and pass in the array as argument
let total = sumNumbers(numbers);

//print the total sum
console.log(`Total sum of numbers after calculations is: ${total}`);
