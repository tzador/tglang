// This code generates a random integer between 0 and 100 and checks if it is divisible by a number input by the user.
// First, we define a function called "checkDivisibility" with two parameters: rand (representing the random number) and input (representing the user's input)
function checkDivisibility(rand, input) {
  // We use the modulus operator to check if the remainder of the random number divided by the user's input is equal to 0
  if (rand % input === 0) {
    // If the remainder is 0, we print a message indicating that the random number is divisible by the user's input
    console.log(`${rand} is divisible by ${input}`);
  } else {
    // If the remainder is not 0, we print a message indicating that the random number is not divisible by the user's input
    console.log(`${rand} is not divisible by ${input}`);
  }
}

// Next, we use the Math.random() function to generate a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)
let randomNumber = Math.random();
// We then multiply this random number by 100 to get a random number between 0 and 100
randomNumber = randomNumber * 100;
// We use the Math.floor() function to round this random number down to the nearest integer
randomNumber = Math.floor(randomNumber);

// We prompt the user to input a number and store it in a variable called "userInput"
let userInput = prompt("Please enter a number:");

// We call the "checkDivisibility" function and pass in the random number and the user's input as arguments
checkDivisibility(randomNumber, userInput);
