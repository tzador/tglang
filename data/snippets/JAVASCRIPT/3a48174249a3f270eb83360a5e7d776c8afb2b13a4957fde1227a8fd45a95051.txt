// This code snippet is a function that takes in two numbers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD).
// It uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD.

function gcd(a, b) {
  // If either number is 0, the GCD is the non-zero number
  if (a === 0) {
    return b;
  }
  else if (b === 0) {
    return a;
  }

  // Keep decreasing the larger number until it becomes smaller than the other number
  while (a >= b) {
    a -= b;
  }

  // If the smaller number is now 0, the GCD is the larger number
  if (a === 0) {
    return b;
  }

  // Otherwise, keep repeating the process with the new numbers
  return gcd(b, a);
}

// To use the function, call it with two numbers as parameters
console.log("The greatest common divisor of 36 and 24 is: " + gcd(36, 24)); // Output: The greatest common divisor of 36 and 24 is: 12
