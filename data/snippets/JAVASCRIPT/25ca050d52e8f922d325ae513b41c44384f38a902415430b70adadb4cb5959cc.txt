//Function to calculate the factorial of a given number
/*
 * Here, we use a recursive approach to calculate the factorial
 * of a number. The function takes in a parameter 'num' which is
 * the number whose factorial is to be calculated. If the number
 * is 0 or 1, the function returns 1 as the factorial. For any other
 * number, the function calls itself, passing in the value of 'num-1'
 * and multiplies it with 'num' to get the factorial. This process is
 * repeated until 'num' becomes 1, hence calculating the factorial.
 */

function factorial(num) {
  if (num === 0 || num == 1) { //Check if number is 0 or 1
    return 1; //Return 1 as factorial
  } else {
    return num * factorial(num - 1); //Recursive call to calculate factorial
  }
}

console.log(factorial(5)); //Output: 120 (5! = 120)
