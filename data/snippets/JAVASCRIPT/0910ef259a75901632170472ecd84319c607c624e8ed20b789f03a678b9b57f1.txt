//This function takes in an array of numbers and returns the average
function calculateAverage(numbers) {
  //Initialize a variable to hold the sum of all numbers
  let sum = 0;
  
  //Loop through the array and add each number to the sum
  for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
  }
  
  //Calculate the average by dividing sum by the length of the array
  let average = sum / numbers.length;
  
  //Return the average value
  return average;
}

//Example usage
let numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20];
let result = calculateAverage(numbers); //Output: 12.5
