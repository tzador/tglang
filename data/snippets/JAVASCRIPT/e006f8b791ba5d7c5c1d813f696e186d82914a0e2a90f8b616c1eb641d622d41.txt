// This code snippet is a function that uses a for loop to iterate through an array and perform a calculation on each element

const calculateSum = (arr) => { // declaring a function "calculateSum" that takes in an array as its argument
    let sum = 0; // declaring a variable "sum" and initializing it to 0
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { // for loop that will iterate through the array using the length of the array as its condition
        sum += arr[i]; // adding the value of the current element in the array to the sum variable
    }
    return sum; // returning the final sum value
}

// Example array
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // declaring an array with 5 numbers

console.log(calculateSum(numbers)); // calling the function and passing in the numbers array as an argument

// Expected output: 15 (sum of all the numbers in the array)

// This function can be used to calculate the sum of any array of numbers.
// It can also be modified to perform other calculations such as finding the average or the product of all the numbers in the array.
