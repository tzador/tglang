// This code snippet creates a function called "sum" that takes in an array of numbers as a parameter
// and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.
function sum(numbers) {
  // Create a variable called "total" and set its initial value to 0.
  let total = 0;
  // Loop through the array using a for loop, starting at index 0 and ending at the length of the array.
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    // Add the current number in the array to the total variable.
    total += numbers[i];
  }
  // Return the final total.
  return total;
}

// Create an array of numbers to test the function.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Call the sum function and pass in the array of numbers as an argument.
let result = sum(numbers);

// Print out the result to the console.
console.log(result); // Prints 15 to the console since that is the sum of all the numbers in the array.
