// This is a complex code snippet in JavaScript
// It includes a function declaration, conditional statements, loops, and array manipulation

// Create a function called 'calculateAge' that takes in two arguments, 'birthYear' and 'currentYear'
function calculateAge(birthYear, currentYear) {
    // Calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year
    let age = currentYear - birthYear;

    // Create a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18
    if (age >= 18) {
        // If the age is greater than or equal to 18, print out a statement saying the person is an adult
        console.log("You are an adult!");
    } else {
        // If the age is less than 18, print out a statement saying the person is a minor
        console.log("You are a minor.");
    }

    // Create an array of numbers called 'numbers'
    let numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];

    // Create a loop that iterates through the array
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        // Multiply each number in the array by 2 and update the value in the array
        numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2;

        // Create a conditional statement to check if the number is divisible by 4
        if (numbers[i] % 4 === 0) {
            // If the number is divisible by 4, print out a statement saying it is divisible by 4
            console.log(numbers[i] + " is divisible by 4.");
        } else {
            // If the number is not divisible by 4, print out the number itself
            console.log(numbers[i]);
        }
    }
}

// Call the 'calculateAge' function with the arguments 1990 and 2020
calculateAge(1990, 2020);
