// This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
const factorial = (num) => {
  // This is a variable that will store the result of the factorial
  let result = 1;

  // This is a loop that will iterate from num to 1, decrementing by 1 each time
  for (let i = num; i > 0; i--) {
    // This will multiply the current result with the current number in the loop
    result *= i;
  }

  // This will return the final result of the factorial calculation
  return result;

// This is an example of calling the factorial function with a given number
factorial(5); // Output: 120
