// This code snippet is a function definition that takes in two parameters, a string and a number.
// The function uses a for loop to iterate through the string, converting each character to its corresponding ASCII code.
// The ASCII codes are then summed and multiplied by the number parameter.
// The resulting product is then returned as the output of the function.
function calculateProduct(str, num) {
  // Initialize a variable to store the sum of ASCII codes.
  let sum = 0;

  // Use a for loop to iterate through the string.
  // The loop will run as many times as the length of the string.
  for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    // Using charCodeAt() method, convert each character to its ASCII code and add it to the sum.
    sum += str.charCodeAt(i);
  }

  // Multiply the sum by the number parameter.
  let product = sum * num;

  // Return the product as the output of the function.
  return product;
}

// Define a variable and assign a string value to it.
let string = "Hello World";

// Define a variable and assign a number value to it.
let number = 5;

// Call the function and pass in the string and number variables as arguments.
// The resulting output will be the product of the string's ASCII codes and the number variable.
calculateProduct(string, number);
