//This code snippet creates a class for a Car object with properties and methods

//Defining the Car class
class Car {
  //Defining the constructor that takes in parameters for the car's make, model, and year
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    //Initializing the properties using the parameters
    this.make = make; 
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    
    //Setting the starting value of the car's speed to 0
    this.speed = 0;
  }
  
  //Defining a method that increases the car's speed by a given value
  accelerate(speedIncrease) {
    //Updating the speed property by adding the given value to it
    this.speed += speedIncrease;
    //Printing a message to show the current speed
    console.log(`The car is now going at a speed of ${this.speed} km/h.`);
  }
  
  //Defining a method that decreases the car's speed by a given value
  decelerate(speedDecrease) {
    //Updating the speed property by subtracting the given value from it
    this.speed -= speedDecrease;
    //Printing a message to show the current speed
    console.log(`The car is now going at a speed of ${this.speed} km/h.`);
  }
  
  //Defining a method that stops the car and sets the speed property to 0
  stop() {
    this.speed = 0;
    //Printing a message to inform that the car has stopped
    console.log("The car has stopped.");
  }
}

//Creating a new instance of the Car class with the specified values
let myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2021);

//Calling the accelerate method on myCar object with a speed increase of 50
myCar.accelerate(50);

//Calling the decelerate method on myCar object with a speed decrease of 30
myCar.decelerate(30); 

//Calling the stop method on myCar object
myCar.stop();

//Output:
//The car is now going at a speed of 50 km/h.
//The car is now going at a speed of 20 km/h.
//The car has stopped.
