const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]; // declaring an array of fruits
let message = `Today, I am going to have some ${fruits.length} different fruits.`; // creating a string using template literals
// looping through the array and adding each fruit to the message string
for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  message += ` I am going to have a ${fruits[i]},`;
}
message += ` Aren't they all delicious?`; // adding the final statement to the message string
console.log(message); // printing the final message to the console

// Output:
// Today, I am going to have some 3 different fruits. I am going to have a apple, I am going to have a banana, I am going to have a orange, Aren't they all delicious?
