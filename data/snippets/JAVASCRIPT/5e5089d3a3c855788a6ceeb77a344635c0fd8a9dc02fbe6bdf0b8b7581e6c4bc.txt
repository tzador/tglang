// Function to calculate factorial of a number using recursion
const factorial = (num) => {
    if (num === 0) { return 1; } // Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    return num * factorial(num - 1); // Recursive function call
}
const number = 6; // Number whose factorial needs to be calculated
console.log(`Factorial of ${number} is ${factorial(number)}`); // Output: Factorial of 6 is 720
