//This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
function factorial(n) {
  //initialize result variable to hold factorial value
  let result = 1;
  
  //loop through all the numbers from 1 to the given number
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    //multiply the result by the current number in the iteration
    result *= i;
  }
  
  //return the factorial value
  return result;
}

//Example usage: calculate factorial of 7
let number = 7;
let factorialValue = factorial(number);

//Print the factorial value
console.log(`The factorial of ${number} is ${factorialValue}.`);
