//This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

//Function that takes in a number as a parameter and calculates its factorial
function factorial(number) {
  let result = 1;
  //For loop that iterates from 1 to the given number
  for (let i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
    //Multiplies the current result by the current iteration number
    result *= i;
  }
  //Returns the calculated factorial as the result
  return result;
}

//Calls the function and assigns the result to a variable
let factorialResult = factorial(5);

//Prints the result to the console
console.log(factorialResult);
