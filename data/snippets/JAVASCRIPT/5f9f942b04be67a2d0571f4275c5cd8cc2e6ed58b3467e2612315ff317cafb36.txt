// This is a complex code snippet that uses various JavaScript concepts and syntax.

// First, we define a function called 'sayHello' that takes in a parameter called 'name'
// and returns a string that greets the name.
function sayHello(name) {
  return `Hello ${name}!`;
}

// Next, we create an object called 'person' that has three properties: name, age, and address.
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 25,
  address: '123 Main Street',
};

// Then, we create an array called 'hobbies' that contains some hobby strings.
const hobbies = ['reading', 'cooking', 'hiking'];

// After that, we use the 'forEach' method to loop through the hobbies array
// and console log each element in the array.
hobbies.forEach(hobby => {
  console.log(hobby);
});

// Next, we use the 'spread' operator to create a new array called 'extendedHobbies'
// that includes all the elements from the original hobbies array plus two additional hobbies.
const extendedHobbies = [...hobbies, 'painting', 'gardening'];

// Then, we create a class called 'Animal' that has a constructor function.
class Animal {
  constructor(name, type) {
    this.name = name;
    this.type = type;
  }

  // The class also has a method called 'makeSound'
  // that logs a string based on the animal's type.
  makeSound() {
    console.log(`${this.name} the ${this.type} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

// Finally, we create a new instance of the Animal class called 'dog'
// and call the 'makeSound' method on it.
const dog = new Animal('Max', 'dog');
dog.makeSound();

// The output of this code snippet would be:
// Hello John!
// reading
// cooking
// hiking
// Max the dog makes a sound.
