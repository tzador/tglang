/*
This is a complex code snippet in JavaScript that makes use of ES6 features such as arrow functions, spread operator, and template literals. It also involves recursion and error handling.

The function below takes in an array of numbers and multiplies each element by 2. It also checks for any invalid inputs and throws an error if necessary.
*/

const multiplyByTwo = (arr) => {
  //error handling for non-array inputs
  if (!Array.isArray(arr)) {
    throw new Error("Input must be an array.");
  }

  //base case for recursion
  if (arr.length === 0) {
    return arr;
  }

  //recursive calls using spread operator to concatenate results
  return [arr[0] * 2, ...multiplyByTwo(arr.slice(1))];
}

//example call with template literals for output
console.log(`Result: ${multiplyByTwo([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])}`);
//output: Result: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
