//This code snippet uses a for loop to calculate and print a Fibonacci sequence
let sequence = [0, 1]; //initializes the sequence array with the first two numbers
let number = 10; //sets the number of elements in the sequence to be calculated

for (let i = 2; i < number; i++) {
  //starts at index 2 since the first two numbers are already defined
  let nextNumber = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2]; //calculates the next number in the sequence
  sequence.push(nextNumber); //adds the next number to the end of the sequence array
}

//prints the sequence to the console
console.log("Fibonacci sequence of " + number + " numbers:");
for (let i = 0; i < sequence.length; i++) {
  //loops through the sequence array and prints each number
  console.log(sequence[i]);
}

/* Output:
Fibonacci sequence of 10 numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
