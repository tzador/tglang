//This is an example of a long and complex code snippet in JavaScript

//Function to check if a number is prime
function isPrime(number) {

    //Check for edge cases
    if (number <= 1) {
        return false;
    }
    if (number <= 3) {
        return true;
    }

    //Check if number is divisible by 2 or 3
    if (number % 2 == 0 || number % 3 == 0) {
        return false;
    }

    //Iterate through all numbers up to square root of given number
    for (var i = 5; i * i <= number; i = i + 6) {
        if (number % i == 0 || number % (i + 2) == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    //If none of the above conditions are met, the number must be prime
    return true;
}

//Function to print all prime numbers within a given range
function printPrimes(start, end) {

    //Loop through all numbers in the given range
    for (var i = start; i <= end; i++) {

        //Check if current number is prime
        if (isPrime(i)) {

            //Print the prime number with a message
            console.log(i + " is a prime number");
        }
    }
}

//Call the function to print all prime numbers from 1 to 50
printPrimes(1, 50);

//Output:
//2 is a prime number
//3 is a prime number
//5 is a prime number
//7 is a prime number
//11 is a prime number
//13 is a prime number
//17 is a prime number
//19 is a prime number
//23 is a prime number
//29 is a prime number
//31 is a prime number
//37 is a prime number
//41 is a prime number
//43 is a prime number
//47 is a prime number
