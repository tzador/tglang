// This code snippet creates a class called Vehicle with two properties: make and model.
class Vehicle {
  constructor(make, model) { // the constructor method takes in two parameters, make and model
    this.make = make; // the make property is set to the value of the make parameter
    this.model = model; // the model property is set to the value of the model parameter
  }

  drive() { // this method is used to simulate driving the vehicle
    console.log(`You are now driving a ${this.make} ${this.model}.`); // prints a message with the make and model of the vehicle
  }
}

// This code snippet creates an instance of the Vehicle class with the make and model of "Toyota" and "Camry".
let myCar = new Vehicle("Toyota", "Camry");

myCar.drive(); // calls the drive method on the myCar instance, output will be: "You are now driving a Toyota Camry."
