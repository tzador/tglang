// This code snippet creates an array of objects and uses a for loop to print out the properties of each object in the array

// Create an array of objects
let employees = [
  { name: "John", age: 30, position: "Developer" },
  { name: "Emily", age: 25, position: "Designer" },
  { name: "Sarah", age: 35, position: "Manager" }
];

// Loop through the array using a for loop
for (let i = 0; i < employees.length; i++) {
  // Access the properties of each object in the array
  let name = employees[i].name;
  let age = employees[i].age;
  let position = employees[i].position;

  // Print out the properties using template literals
  console.log(`Employee ${i + 1}: ${name} is ${age} years old and works as a ${position}.`);
}

/* Expected Output:
Employee 1: John is 30 years old and works as a Developer.
Employee 2: Emily is 25 years old and works as a Designer.
Employee 3: Sarah is 35 years old and works as a Manager.
