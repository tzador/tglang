// This code declares a class named "Person"

  // The constructor function takes in three parameters: name, age, and hobby
  constructor(name, age, hobby) {
    this.name = name;       // Sets the "name" property to the passed in name
    this.age = age;         // Sets the "age" property to the passed in age
    this.hobby = hobby;     // Sets the "hobby" property to the passed in hobby
  }

  getInfo() {

  // This method updates the person's age by adding one to the current age
  birthday() {

// This code creates a new instance of the Person class and assigns it to a variable called "person"
const person = new Person("John", 25, "hiking");

// This calls the "getInfo" method on the "person" instance and prints the returned string to the console
console.log(person.getInfo());

// This calls the "birthday" method on the "person" instance and prints the returned string to the console
console.log(person.birthday());

// The output would be:
// "John is 25 years old and enjoys hiking."
// "Happy birthday, John! You are now 26 years old."
