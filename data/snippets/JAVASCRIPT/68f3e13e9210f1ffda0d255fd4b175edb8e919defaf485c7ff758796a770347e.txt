//This is a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the array

const sumEvenNumbers = (numbers) => {
  let sum = 0; //initialize a variable to store the sum
  numbers.forEach(num => { //loop through the array using forEach method
    if(num % 2 === 0){ //check if the number is even
      sum += num; //if it is, add it to the sum variable
    }
  });
  return sum; //return the final sum 
}

//Example input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
//Example output: 20
