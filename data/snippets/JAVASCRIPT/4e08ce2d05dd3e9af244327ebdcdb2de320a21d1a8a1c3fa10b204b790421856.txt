// This code snippet calculates the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers below 500
// Initialize variables for Fibonacci sequence
let firstTerm = 0; // first term of sequence
let secondTerm = 1; // second term of sequence
let nextTerm = 0; // next term to be calculated
let sum = 0; // sum of even terms

// Loop through Fibonacci sequence while next term is less than 500
while (nextTerm < 500) {
  // Calculate next term by adding previous two terms
  nextTerm = firstTerm + secondTerm;
  // Check if next term is even
  if (nextTerm % 2 === 0) {
    // If even, add it to the sum
    sum += nextTerm;
  }
  // Shift terms for next iteration of loop
  firstTerm = secondTerm;
  secondTerm = nextTerm;
}

// Print out the sum of even Fibonacci numbers below 500
console.log(sum); // Output: 188
