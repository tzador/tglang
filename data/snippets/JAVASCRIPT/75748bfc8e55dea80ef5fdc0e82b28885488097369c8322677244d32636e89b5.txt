//This code snippet creates a class called Employee with properties and methods

class Employee { //defining the Employee class
  constructor(name, age, position) { //constructor function with parameters for name, age, and position
    this.name = name; //setting the name property to the name parameter
    this.age = age; //setting the age property to the age parameter
    this.position = position; //setting the position property to the position parameter

  //a method to get the employee's details
  getDetails() {
    return `Name: ${this.name}\nAge: ${this.age}\nPosition: ${this.position}`;

  changePosition(newPosition) {
    this.position = newPosition; //updating the position property to the new position
    console.log(`Position changed to ${this.position}`);
  }
}

//creating an instance of the Employee class
let employee1 = new Employee("John Smith", 30, "Manager");

//calling the getDetails method and printing the output to the console
console.log(employee1.getDetails());

//calling the changePosition method and passing in the new position
employee1.changePosition("Senior Manager"); 

//output: Name: John Smith
          Age: 30
          Position: Manager
