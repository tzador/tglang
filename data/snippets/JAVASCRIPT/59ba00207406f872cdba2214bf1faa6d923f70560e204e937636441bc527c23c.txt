//Function for calculating the factorial of an input number
const factorial = (num) => {
  //Initializing the factorial value to 1
  let result = 1;
  
  //Looping through numbers from 1 up to the input number
  for(let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    //Multiplying the current result by the current number in the loop
    result = result * i;
  }
  
  //Returning the final result
  return result;
}

//Calling the factorial function with input of 5
console.log(factorial(5));

//Output: 120 (5! = 120)
