//This code snippet creates an object called "person" with properties "name," "age," and "occupation."
//The values of these properties are taken as user input and then displayed on the console.

//Define the object
var person = {};

//Prompt user for input
person.name = prompt("Enter your name:");
person.age = Number(prompt("Enter your age:"));
person.occupation = prompt("Enter your occupation:");

//Function to display object properties on console
function displayPerson(obj) {
  console.log("Name: " + obj.name);
  console.log("Age: " + obj.age);
  console.log("Occupation: " + obj.occupation);
}

//Call the displayPerson function and pass in the "person" object as an argument
displayPerson(person);

/* Example output:
Name: John Doe
Age: 25
Occupation: Teacher */
