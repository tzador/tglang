(* The following code snippet creates a function that calculates the square of a number *)

square[n_] := n^2; (* Function that takes in a number 'n' as input and returns its square *)

(* Test cases *)
square[2] (* Output: 4 *)
square[-3] (* Output: 9 *)
square[0] (* Output: 0 *)

(* The following code snippet creates a list of numbers and uses the function 'square' to calculate their squares *)

numbers = {-2, 4, 0, -5, 3}; (* List of numbers *)

Map[square, numbers] (* Output: {4, 16, 0, 25, 9} *)
