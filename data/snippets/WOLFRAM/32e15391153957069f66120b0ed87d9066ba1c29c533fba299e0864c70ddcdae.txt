(* This code snippet uses the Wolfram Mathematica programming language to calculate the mean
   and standard deviation of a list of numbers *)

(* Define a function that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean *)
mean[list_] := Total[list]/Length[list]

(* Define a function that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the standard deviation *)
stdev[list_] := Sqrt[Total[(list - mean[list])^2]/(Length[list] - 1)]

(* Create a list of numbers *)
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

(* Calculate the mean of the list of numbers and store it in a variable *)
mean = mean[numbers];

(* Calculate the standard deviation of the list of numbers and store it in a variable *)
stdev = stdev[numbers];

(* Print the mean and standard deviation to the console *)
Print["The mean is ", mean, " and the standard deviation is ", stdev];

(* Output:
The mean is 5.5 and the standard deviation is 3.02765  *)
