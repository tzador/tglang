(* This code snippet calculates the Euclidean distance between two points *)

(* Define a function with two arguments, representing the two points *)
euclideanDistance[p1_, p2_]:=Sqrt[(p1[[1]]-p2[[1]])^2+(p1[[2]]-p2[[2]])^2]

(* Define variables representing the first and second point *)
point1 = {3,5};
point2 = {7,-2};

(* Call the function and store the result in a variable *)
distance = euclideanDistance[point1,point2];

(* Print the result *)
Print["The Euclidean distance between point1 and point2 is:", distance];
