(* This program uses the built-in DateFunction to generate a time series of air 
   temperature values for a specific location and dates *)

(* Import and assign location using EntityProperty *)
location = Entity["City", "Paris", "France"][EntityProperty["City", 
   "ClimateData"]];

(* Set start and end dates for time series *)
startDate = DateObject[{2016, 1, 1}, TimeZone -> location[EntityProperty["City",
   "TimeZone"]]];
endDate = DateObject[{2016, 12, 31}, TimeZone -> location[EntityProperty["City", 
   "TimeZone"]]];

(* Generate time series of air temperature using WeatherData function *)
temperatureSeries = WeatherData[location, "Temperature", {startDate, endDate, 
   "Day"}];

(* Plot the time series with appropriate labels and titles *)
DateListPlot[temperatureSeries, AxesLabel -> {"Date", "Temperature (Â°C)"}, 
   PlotLabel -> "Air Temperature in Paris, France (2016)"]

(* Calculate the average temperature using Mean function *)
averageTemperature = Mean[temperatureSeries];

(* Print the average temperature with appropriate labels *)
Print["The average temperature in Paris, France in 2016 was ", 
   averageTemperature, "Â°C."]
