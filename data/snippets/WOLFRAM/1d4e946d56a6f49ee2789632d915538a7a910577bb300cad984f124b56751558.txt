(* This is a code snippet written in the WOLFRAM programming language *)

(* First, we define a function called "sum" that takes in two parameters,
   "num1" and "num2" and returns the sum of the two numbers *)
sum[num1_, num2_] := num1 + num2

(* Next, we create a list of numbers and store it in a variable called "numbers" *)
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

(* Using the built-in function "Map", we apply the "sum" function to every element
   in the "numbers" list and store the result in a new variable called "sum_numbers" *)
sum_numbers = Map[sum[#, 10]&, numbers]

(* Now, we filter out any numbers in the "sum_numbers" list that are greater than 15
   and store the result in a variable called "filtered_numbers" *)
filtered_numbers = Select[sum_numbers, # < 15&]

(* Finally, we print out the filtered numbers in a table using the "TableForm" function *)
TableForm[{filtered_numbers}, TableHeadings->{None, {"Filtered Numbers"}}]
