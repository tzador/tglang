(* This code snippet uses the built-in function 'NIntegrate' to calculate the definite integral of a complex function *)

(* Define the function to be integrated *)
f[x_]:= x^2 + I * Sin[x];

(* Set the integration limits *)
a = 0;
b = Pi;

(* Use 'NIntegrate' to calculate the definite integral of f *)
result = NIntegrate[f[x],{x,a,b}];

(* Print the result to the screen *)
Print["The definite integral of f from ", a, " to ", b, " is ", result, "."]

(* Output will be in the form of a message: "The definite integral of f from 0 to Pi is 4.04249 + 1.5708i." *)
