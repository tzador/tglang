(* This is a program that calculates the volume of a sphere based on its radius *)

(* Input the radius of the sphere *)
radius = Input["Enter the radius of the sphere:"];

(* Declare a function to calculate the volume of a sphere *)
SphereVolume[r_] := 4/3 * Pi * r^3;

(* Calculate the volume of the sphere using the input radius *)
volume = SphereVolume[radius];

(* Print the result to the screen *)
Print["The volume of the sphere with radius", radius, "is", volume];

(* Output: The volume of the sphere with radius <input radius> is <calculated volume> *)
