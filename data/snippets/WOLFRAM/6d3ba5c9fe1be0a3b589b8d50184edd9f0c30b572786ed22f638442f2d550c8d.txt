(*Define a function that calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence*)
fib[n_] := Which[
    n == 0, 0,
    n == 1, 1,
    n > 1, fib[n-1] + fib[n-2]
]

(*Generate a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term*)
fibList[n_] := Table[fib[i], {i, 0, n}]

(*Calculate the value of the 10th term in the Fibonacci sequence*)
fib[10]

(*Output: 55*)
