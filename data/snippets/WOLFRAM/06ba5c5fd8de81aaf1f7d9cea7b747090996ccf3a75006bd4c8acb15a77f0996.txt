(* This is a complex code snippet written in the Wolfram Language. *)
(* It aims to generate a random maze using Prim's algorithm and plot it using GraphPlot *)

(* First, we define the size of the maze *)
size = 10;

(* Next, we generate a grid of size*size cells *)
grid = Table[0, {size}, {size}];

(* Then, we randomly choose a starting cell *)
startRow = RandomInteger[{1, size}];
startCol = RandomInteger[{1, size}];
grid[[startRow, startCol]] = 1; (* This denotes the starting cell *)

(* We also randomly choose a neighboring cell and add it to the grid *)
addCell[row_, col_] := Module[{neighbors, pick},
  neighbors = Select[{{row - 1, col}, {row + 1, col}, {row, col - 1}, {row, col + 1}}, 
    0 <= #[[1]] <= size && 0 <= #[[2]] <= size && grid[[#[[1]], #[[2]]]] == 0 &];
  If[neighbors != {},
    pick = RandomChoice[neighbors];
    grid[[pick[[1]], pick[[2]]]] = 1; (* This denotes the cell that is added to the maze *)
    {pick[[1]], pick[[2]]},
    {-1, -1} (* Returns an invalid position if there are no valid neighboring cells *)
  ]
];

(* Using Prim's algorithm, we add cells to the maze until all cells are connected *)
added = {{startRow, startCol}, {-1, -1}};
While[Length[Flatten[grid, 1]] < size*size,
  pos = addCell[#[[1]], #[[2]]] & /@ added;
  added = Select[pos, #[[1]] != -1 &]; (* Remove the invalid positions *)
  If[ Length[added] > 0,
    grid[[#[[1]], #[[2]]]] = 1 & /@ added
  ]
];

(* Finally, we plot the maze using GraphPlot *)
GraphPlot[grid, VertexLabeling -> False, VertexShape -> None, 
  EdgeStyle -> Directive[Thickness[0.02], Hue[0.4, 0.6, 0.8]]]
