(* ::Section:: *)
(* Introduction *)

(* This is a code snippet in the Wolfram programming language. It is used for mathematical and computational tasks, and has a rich set of built-in functions for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. This code snippet will demonstrate the use of some of these functions. *)

(* ::Subsection:: *)
(* Constants *)

(* The Wolfram language includes predefined constants, such as Pi and Euler's number. In this code snippet, we will use these constants to calculate the surface area and volume of a sphere. *)

(* define radius of sphere *)
r = 5;

(* calculate surface area and volume *)
s = 4 * Pi * r^2;
v = (4/3) * Pi * r^3;

(* print results *)
Print["Surface Area =", s];
Print["Volume =", v];

(* ::Subsection:: *)
(* Lists *)

(* Lists are a fundamental data structure in the Wolfram language. They can contain any type of data and can be nested to create multidimensional lists. In this code snippet, we will create a list of prime numbers and then find the sum of the first 10 primes. *)

(* generate list of prime numbers *)
primes = Prime[Range[10]];

(* find sum of first 10 primes *)
sum = Total[primes];

(* print sum *)
Print["Sum of first 10 primes =", sum];

(* ::Subsection:: *)
(* Functions *)

(* Functions are blocks of code that can be reused multiple times with different inputs. In this code snippet, we will define a function that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height. *)

(* define triangle area function *)
triangleArea[b_, h_] := (b * h) / 2;

(* calculate area of triangle with base 5 and height 3 *)
a = triangleArea[5, 3];

(* print result *)
Print["Area of triangle =", a];

(* ::Subsection:: *)
(* Plots *)

(* The Wolfram language also has powerful capabilities for data visualization. In this code snippet, we will plot the curve of a sine function. *)

(* define x and y values *)
x = Range[0, 4 * Pi, 0.1];
y = Sin[x];

(* plot sine curve *)
ListLinePlot[{x, y}, PlotStyle -> Red, AxesLabel -> {"x", "y"}, PlotLabel -> "Sine Curve"];

(* ::Subsection:: *)
(* Importing and Manipulating Data *)

(* The Wolfram language can also import and manipulate data from various sources, including spreadsheets and databases. In this code snippet, we will import a sample dataset and calculate the average age of the individuals in the dataset. *)

(* import dataset *)
dataset = Import["sample_data.csv"];

(* extract ages *)
ages = dataset[[All, "Age"]];

(* calculate average age *)
avg = Mean[ages];

(* print result *)
Print["Average age of individuals =", avg];
