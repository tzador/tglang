(*
This is a code snippet in Wolfram Language.
It generates a list of all prime numbers between 2 and a given number, using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
*)

(* Define a function that takes in a limit and generates a list of all possible integers from 2 to the limit. *)
generateList[n_Integer?Positive] := Range[2, n]

(* Define a function that removes all multiples of a given number from a list, leaving only prime numbers. *)
removeMultiples[list_, n_Integer] := Select[list, Mod[#, n] != 0 &]

(* Define a recursive function that uses the previous two functions to generate a list of prime numbers. *)
sieve[list_, {}] := list
sieve[list_, {p_, primes__}] := sieve[removeMultiples[list, p], primes]

(* Call the sieve function with a given limit and store the output in a variable. *)
primes = sieve[generateList[100], generateList[100]]

(* Output the list of prime numbers. *)
