(* This program uses the SVD algorithm to decompose a given matrix into its singular value decomposition *)
(* Define the matrix to be decomposed *)
matrix = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};

(* Calculate the singular value decomposition using the built-in function *)
{U, S, V} = SingularValueDecomposition[matrix];

(* Print the results in a human-readable format *)
Print["The original matrix is:", matrix];
Print["The left singular vectors are:", U];
Print["The singular values are:", S];
Print["The right singular vectors are:", V];

(* Calculate the reconstructed matrix using the SVD components *)
reconstructedMatrix = U.S.Transpose[V];

(* Check if the reconstructed matrix is equal to the original matrix *)
If[matrix === reconstructedMatrix,
    Print["The original matrix has been successfully decomposed and reconstructed."],
    Print["Something went wrong. The reconstructed matrix is not equal to the original."]
]
