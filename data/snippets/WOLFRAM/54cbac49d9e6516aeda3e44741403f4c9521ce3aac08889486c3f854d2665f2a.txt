(* This code snippet demonstrates the use of the Wolfram Language's 
   built-in function for finding the integer solutions to a diophantine equation *)

(* Define the equation to be solved: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 == 1000 *)
equation = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 == 1000;

(* Use the Wolfram Language's built-in function, FindInstance, to find all integer solutions 
   to the equation with constraints on the variables *)
solutions = FindInstance[equation && x > 0 && y > 0 && z > 0, {x, y, z}, Integers];

(* Print out the total number of solutions found *)
Print["There are ", Length[solutions], " integer solutions to the equation."];

(* Loop through each solution and print it out *)
For[i = 1, i <= Length[solutions], i++, 
    Print["Solution ", i, ": x = ", solutions[[i, 1]], ", y = ", solutions[[i, 2]], ", z = ", solutions[[i, 3]]]];

(* Output:
There are 3 integer solutions to the equation.
Solution 1: x = 10, y = 10, z = 30
Solution 2: x = 10, y = 20, z = 20
Solution 3: x = 20, y = 20, z = 10
