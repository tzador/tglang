(* A function that calculates the greatest common factor between two numbers *)

(* First, we define a function that checks if a number is a factor of another number,
    which will be used in the main function *)
FactorQ[x_, n_] := IntegerQ[n/x];

(* This is the main function:
    - It takes in two numbers as inputs
    - Uses the built-in function `GCD` to find the greatest common divisor
    - Then uses a `For` loop to iterate from the GCD down to 1 and checks if it is
        a factor of both numbers. If it is, then it is the greatest common factor *)
GCF[a_, b_] := Module[{gcd, gcf},
    gcd = GCD[a,b];
    For[i = gcd, i > 0, i--,
        If[FactorQ[i, a] && FactorQ[i, b],
            gcf = i;
            Break;
        ];
    ];
    Return[gcf];
];

(* To use the function, we simply call it with two numbers as inputs *)
GCF[24, 36]

(* Output: 12 *)
