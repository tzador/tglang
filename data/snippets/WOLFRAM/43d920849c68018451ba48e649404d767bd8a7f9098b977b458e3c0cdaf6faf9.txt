(*This code uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of a polynomial function.*)

(*Define the function*)
poly[x_] := 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 1;

(*Define the derivative of the function*)
polyDerivative[x_] := 6x^2 + 10x - 3;

(*Initialize the starting point for the method*)
x0 = 1;

(*Set the tolerance level for convergence*)
tolerance = 0.00001;

(*Initialize the number of maximum iterations*)
maxIterations = 50;

(*Define the iteration formula*)
(*The iteration formula is x[n+1] = x[n] - f(x[n])/f'(x[n])*)
iterationFormula[x_] := x - poly[x]/polyDerivative[x];

(*Initialize the iteration counter and the previous guess*)
iteration = 0;
xPrev = x0;

(*Perform the Newton-Raphson method until convergence or maximum iterations are reached*)
While[Abs[poly[xPrev]] > tolerance && iteration < maxIterations,
  (*Calculate the new guess using the iteration formula*)
  xNext = iterationFormula[xPrev];
  
  (*Update the previous guess and the iteration counter*)
  xPrev = xNext;
  iteration++;

(*Print the final root of the polynomial*)
Print["The root is ", xNext];
