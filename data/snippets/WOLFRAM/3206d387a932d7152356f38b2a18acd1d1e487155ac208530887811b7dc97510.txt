(*Step 1: Define function*)
f[x_]:= x^2 -5x + 6

(*Step 2: Create a list of numbers*)
list = Range[-5,5]

(*Step 3: Apply function to the list*)
mapList = Map[f, list]

(*Step 4: Filter the list to only include even numbers*)
filteredList = Select[mapList, EvenQ]

(*Step 5: Use a conditional function to check which numbers are greater than 10*)
conditionedList = If[#>10, #, "Not Greater than 10"]& /@ filteredList

(*Step 6: Get the sum of the filtered and conditioned list*)
totalSum = Total[conditionedList]

(*Step 7: Print the total sum using a formatted string*)
Print["The total sum of the filtered and conditioned list is ", totalSum]
