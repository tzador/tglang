(* This is a code snippet in the programming language Wolfram. It uses the PaddingLayer function to create a convolutional neural network. *)

PaddingLayer[ConvolutionalLayer[32, {3, 3}]] [* This layer adds zero padding to the input, creating a border around the image. The ConvolutionalLayer specifies the number of output channels and the size of the convolution filter. *]

BatchNormalizationLayer[] [* This layer normalizes the input data to improve training. *]

PoolingLayer[{2, 2}, "Stride" -> 2] [* This layer reduces the size of the image by applying a max pooling operation with a 2x2 filter and a stride of 2. *]

BatchNormalizationLayer[] [* Another normalization layer. *]

PaddingLayer[ConvolutionalLayer[64, {3, 3}]] [* Another convolutional layer with 64 output channels and a 3x3 filter. *]

BatchNormalizationLayer[] [* Another normalization layer. *]

PoolingLayer[{2, 2}, "Stride" -> 2] [* Another pooling layer with a 2x2 filter and a stride of 2. *]

FlattenLayer[] [* This layer flattens the output of the previous layer into a 1D vector. *]

DotLayer[10] [* This layer performs a dot product on the input data with a weight matrix of size 10. *]
