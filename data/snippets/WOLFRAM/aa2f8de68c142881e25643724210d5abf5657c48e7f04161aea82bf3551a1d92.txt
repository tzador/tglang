(* This function performs a series of mathematical operations
   on two lists of numbers and returns the result as a new list. *)

(* Define the function with two arguments, list1 and list2 *)
listOperation[list1_, list2_] := (
  (* Calculate the sum of the two lists and assign it to a variable *)
  sum = list1 + list2;
  (* Calculate the product of the two lists and assign it to a variable *)
  product = list1 * list2;
  (* Calculate the difference between the two lists and assign it to a variable *)
  difference = list1 - list2;
  (* Calculate the quotient of the two lists and assign it to a variable *)
  quotient = list1 / list2;
  (* Calculate the power of the two lists and assign it to a variable *)
  power = list1 ^ list2;
  (* Calculate the square root of each element in list1 and assign it to a variable *)
  sqrtList1 = Sqrt[list1];
  (* Calculate the square root of each element in list2 and assign it to a variable *)
  sqrtList2 = Sqrt[list2];
  (* Combine all the calculated values into a single list and return it *)
