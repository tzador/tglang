(* Code for finding the sum of the first n terms in an arithmetic sequence *)
n = 10; (*Number of terms in the sequence*)
a = 3;  (*First term of the sequence*)
d = 2; (*Common difference between terms*)

sum = (n/2)*(2*a+(n-1)*d); (*Formula for the sum of arithmetic sequence*)
(*Note: To give proper credit or reference, it is important to annotate your code*)

(* Output: The sum of the first 10 terms in the arithmetic sequence with first term 3 and common difference of 2 is 135 *)
