(* This is a complex program that calculates
the sum of squares of a list of numbers *)

(* Define a function that squares a number *)
square[x_] := x^2;

(* Define a function that sums a list of numbers *)
sumList[list_] := Total[list];

(* Create a list of numbers *)
list = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};

(* Map the square function to the list *)
squaredList = Map[square, list];

(* Sum the squared list using the sumList function *)
sum = sumList[squaredList];

(* Print the result *)
Print[sum];

(* Output: 220, which is the sum of squares of the numbers in the list *)
