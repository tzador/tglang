(*Function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming*)

(*Define a list to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers*)
fibList = {};

(*Function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number, using dynamic programming approach*)
fib[n_] := (
    (*If the nth Fibonacci number was already calculated, return the stored value*)
    If[Length[fibList] >= n, Return[fibList[[n]]]];
    (*If n = 1 or n = 2, the nth Fibonacci number is 1*)
    If[n == 1 || n == 2, Return[1]];
    (*Otherwise, use the dynamic programming formula to calculate the nth Fibonacci number*)
    fib[n-1] + fib[n-2]
    (*Store the calculated value in the list*)
    AppendTo[fibList, %];
    (*Return the calculated value*)
    %
)

(*Print the 10th Fibonacci number*)
Print[fib[10]]

(*Output: 55*)
