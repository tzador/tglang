(* This is a complex code snippet in the WOLFRAM programming language.
It uses a variety of functions and operations to perform a series of calculations and data manipulations. *)

(* Define a list of integers *)
list = {1, 2, 3, 4};

(* Calculate the length of the list *)
listLength = Length[list];

(* Create an empty list to store the results *)
resultList = {};

(* Use a for loop to iterate through each element in the original list *)
For[i = 1, i <= listLength, i++,

(* Calculate the square of each element in the original list *)
square = list[[i]]^2;

(* Add the squared value to the results list *)
AppendTo[resultList, square];

(* Print the squared value *)
Print["The square of ", list[[i]], " is ", square];
]

(* Print the final results list *)
Print["The final list is ", resultList];

(* Find the maximum value in the result list *)
maxValue = Max[resultList];

(* Find the position of the maximum value in the list *)
maxPosition = Position[resultList, maxValue];

(* Print the maximum value and its position *)
Print["The maximum value is ", maxValue, " and its position is ", maxPosition];
