(* Defines a function for calculating the factorial of a number *) 

(* `y` is the number whose factorial is to be calculated *) 
(* Returns the factorial of `y` *) 
factorial[y_] := Module[{n = y, result = 1}, (* Uses Module to create a local variable `n` and initialize `result` to 1 *) 
	While[n > 0,  (* Uses a While loop to iterate through all numbers from `y` to 1 *) 
	    result = result * n; (* Multiplies `result` by `n` and assigns the new value to `result` *) 
	    n = n-1; (* Decrements `n` by 1 *) 
	]; 
	return result; (* Returns the final value of `result`, which is the factorial of `y` *) 

(* Example usage of the factorial function *) 
factorial[5] (* Returns 120, which is the factorial of 5 *)
