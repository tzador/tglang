(* This is a function that takes in two parameters, x and y, and returns their sum *)

sum[x_, y_] := Module[{total = x + y}, (* First, we initialize a temporary variable named total to hold the sum of x and y *)
    Print["The total of ", x, " and ", y, " is: ", total]; (* This line uses the Wolfram's Print function to output the total *)
    Return[total] (* Finally, we return the value of total *)

sum[5, 10] (* Calling the function with x = 5 and y = 10 will output "The total of 5 and 10 is: 15" and return the value 15 *)
