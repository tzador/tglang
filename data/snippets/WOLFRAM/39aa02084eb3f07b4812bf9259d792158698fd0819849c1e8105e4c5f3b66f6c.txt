g[x_,y_] := Module[{a,b,c}, b = 2x+1; c = 3y+4; a = b + c; Return[a]];
(*This is a function in Wolfram that takes in two parameters, x and y, and assigns values to variables a, b, and c using Module. 
The value of b is set to 2 times x plus 1, while the value of c is set to 3 times y plus 4.
The value of a is then calculated by adding b and c, and returned as the output of the function.*)
g[5,6]
(*This calls the function g with the parameters 5 and 6, which would result in a being equal to 23.*)
