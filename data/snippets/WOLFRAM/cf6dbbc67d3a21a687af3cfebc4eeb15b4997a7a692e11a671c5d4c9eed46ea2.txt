(* This code snippet is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion *)
(* Input: n = an integer *)
(* Output: factorial(n) = the factorial of n *)

factorial[n_] := If[n== 0, 1, n * factorial[n-1]]
(* In this code, the function 'factorial' takes in a parameter 'n' and checks if it is equal to 0. 
If it is, it returns 1, otherwise it multiplies 'n' with the result of calling the 'factorial' function again, 
this time with the parameter 'n-1'. This process continues until the base case of n==0 is reached. 
This implementation of factorial using recursion is efficient for small values of n but may result in a stack overflow for large values.*)
