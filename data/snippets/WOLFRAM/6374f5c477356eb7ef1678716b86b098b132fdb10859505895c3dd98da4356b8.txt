(* This is a program written in the Wolfram programming language *)
(* The following code calculates the average of a list of numbers *)

(* Define a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns their average *)
averageFunction[list_] := Module[{total = 0, count = 0},
    (* Loop through the list and add each number to the total *)
    For[i = 1, i <= Length[list], i++,
        total = total + list[[i]];
        count++;
    ];
    (* Calculate and return the average by dividing the total by the count *)
    average = total/count;
    average
](* This is the end of the averageFunction *)

(* Define a list of numbers *)
numbers = {5, 8, 12, 3, 20, 10};

(* Call the averageFunction and pass in the list of numbers *)
averageResult = averageFunction[numbers];

(* Print the result *)
Print["The average of ", numbers, " is ", averageResult](* This is the end of the program *)
