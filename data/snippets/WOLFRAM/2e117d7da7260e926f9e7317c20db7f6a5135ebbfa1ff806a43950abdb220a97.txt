(*This code snippet calculates the slope of a line function*)
lineFunction = Function[{x,y}, mx+b] (*defining a two-variable function*)
m = Input["Enter the value of slope, m: "]; (*prompt user to input slope*)
b = Input["Enter the value of y-intercept, b: "]; (*prompt user to input y-intercept*)
slope = D[lineFunction[x,y],x]; (*calculates the slope using derivative*)
Print["The slope of the line function is: ",slope]; (*prints the calculated slope*)
