(* This is a code snippet in the programming language WOLFRAM. *)

(* Define a function that calculates the factorial of a number. *)

factorial[n_] := Module[{result = 1},
    (* Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n. *)
    For[i = 1, i <= n, i++,
        (* Multiply the current result by the current value of i. *)
        result *= i;
    ];
    (* Return the result. *)
    result
];

(* Call the factorial function and pass in a number. *)
factorial[5] (* Output: 120 *)
