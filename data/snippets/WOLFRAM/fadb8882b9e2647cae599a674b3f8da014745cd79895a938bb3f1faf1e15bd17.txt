(* This is a code snippet in the programming language WOLFRAM *)

(* Create a list of squares from 1^2 to 10^2 *)
squares = Table[i^2, {i,1,10}];

(* Create a function to filter out even squares *)
EvenQ[x_] := Mod[x,2] == 0;

(* Apply the function to the list of squares *)
filteredSquares = Select[squares, EvenQ];

(* Print the filtered squares *)
filteredSquares

(* Output:
{4, 16, 36, 64, 100}
