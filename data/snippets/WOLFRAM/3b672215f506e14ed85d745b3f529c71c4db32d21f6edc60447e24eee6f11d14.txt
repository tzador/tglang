(* This code snippet calculates the area of a circle with a given radius *)


(* Define a function that takes in the radius *)
calculateArea[radius_] := 
 Block[{pi = Pi}, 
  (* Use the formula for area of a circle *)
  area = pi * radius^2;
  (* Print the result *)
  Print["The area of the circle is ", area];]


(* Call the function with a radius of 5 *)
calculateArea[5]

(* Output: 
The area of the circle is 78.5398
*)
