(* This code snippet calculates the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence *)

(* define a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence *)
fibonacci[n_Integer] := Module[{a = 0, b = 1, c},
    (* use a for loop to iterate through the first 10 terms *)
    For[i = 1, i <= 10, i++,
        (* calculate the value of the next term by summing the previous two terms *)
        c = a + b;
        (* update the values of a and b to prepare for the next iteration *)

(* call the fibonacci function with an input of 10 *)
