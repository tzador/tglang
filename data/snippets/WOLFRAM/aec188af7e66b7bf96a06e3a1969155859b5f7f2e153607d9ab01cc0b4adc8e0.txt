(* This code snippet shows an implementation of the SEIR model in Wolfram. *)

(* Define initial values *)
S0 = 1000; (* initial susceptible population *)
E0 = 50; (* initial exposed population *)
I0 = 10; (* initial infected population *)
R0 = 0; (* initial recovered population *)
N = S0 + E0 + I0 + R0; (* total population *)

(* Define parameters *)
b = 0.1; (* infection rate *)
a = 0.2; (* transition rate from exposed to infected *)
g = 0.05; (* recovery rate *)

(* Define differential equations *)
dS/dt = -b*S*I/N; (* rate of change of susceptible population *)
dE/dt = b*S*I/N - a*E; (* rate of change of exposed population *)
dI/dt = a*E - g*I; (* rate of change of infected population *)
dR/dt = g*I; (* rate of change of recovered population *)

(* Solve the differential equations and plot the results *)
sol = NDSolve[{dS/dt, dE/dt, dI/dt, dR/dt}, {S[t], E[t], I[t], R[t]}, {t, 0, 100}];
Plot[{S[t], E[t], I[t], R[t]}, {t, 0, 100}, PlotLegends -> {"Susceptible", "Exposed", "Infected", "Recovered"}]
