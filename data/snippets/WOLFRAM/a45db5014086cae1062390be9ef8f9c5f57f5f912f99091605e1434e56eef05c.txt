(* This is a function that calculates the highest common factor of two numbers using recursion *)

(* The function takes in two parameters, x and y, which represent the two numbers to be checked *)
hcf[x_, y_] := (
  If[x == y, (* If both numbers are equal, then the hcf is simply the number itself *)
   Print["The HCF of ", x, " and ", y, " is: ", x],
   If[x > y, (* If x is greater, then recursively call the function with x-y and y *)
    hcf[x - y, y],
    hcf[y - x, x] (* If y is greater, then recursively call the function with y-x and x *)
   ]
  )
)

(* Example usage: *)
hcf[12, 8] (* Output: The HCF of 12 and 8 is: 4 *)

(* This function can also handle negative numbers and zeros *)
hcf[-14, 0] (* Output: The HCF of -14 and 0 is: 14 *)
