(* This code snippet calculates the n-th term of the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive approach *)

(* Define a function fib that takes in a positive integer n *)
fib[n_] := (
    (* If n is equal to 1 or 2, return 1 as the n-th term *)
    If[n == 1 || n == 2, 
        Return[1], 
    (* Otherwise, recursively call the function fib and return the sum of the n-1 and n-2th terms *)
    Return[fib[n-1] + fib[n-2]]
    ]
)

(* Call the function fib to calculate the 10th term of the Fibonacci sequence *)
fib[10]
