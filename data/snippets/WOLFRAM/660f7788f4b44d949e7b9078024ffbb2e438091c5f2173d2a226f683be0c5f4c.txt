(* This is a function that takes in a parameter x and uses a nested If-statement to determine if it is less than a or greater than b. If it is less than a, it will print "x is less than a" and if it is greater than b, it will print "x is greater than b". This function utilizes a Module to set local variables a and b to 5 and 10, respectively. *)

f[3] (* Output: x is less than a *)
f[12] (* Output: x is greater than b *)
