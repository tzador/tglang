(* This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of their squares *)
sumSquares[list_]:=Map[Power[#,2]&,list] (* Map function applies the Power function to each element in the list and returns a list of their squares *)
total=Total[sumSquares[Range[10]]] (* Uses the previously defined function to calculate the sum of squares from 1 to 10 *)
Print["The total sum of squares from 1 to 10 is: ",total]; (* Prints out the final result *)
