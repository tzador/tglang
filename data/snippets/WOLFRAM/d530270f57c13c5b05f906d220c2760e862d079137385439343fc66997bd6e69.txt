(* This section defines a function for calculating the factorial of a given number *)

factorial[n_] := Module[{result = 1, i = 1},
  (* The module initializes a local variable 'result' to 1 and 'i' to 1 *)
  While[i <= n, (* The while loop checks if 'i' is less than or equal to 'n' *)
    result = result * i; (* The result is multiplied by 'i' in each iteration *)
    i++ (* The value of 'i' is incremented *)
  ];
  result (* The result is returned as the output of the function *)
];

(* Input the number for which factorial has to be calculated *)
n = Input["Enter a number:"];
(* The value of 'n' is stored in the variable 'n' *)

Print["The factorial of ", n, " is ", factorial[n]];
(* The result is displayed using the 'Print' function *)
