(* This is a function that calculates the square root of a given number *)
(* Takes in a number as input and returns its square root as output *)
SquareRoot[x_]:=Block[{guess=x/2,precision=10^-5,iterations=10},
    (* The guess is initially set to half the input, but can be changed if desired *)
    (* Precision determines the accuracy of the calculation, can be adjusted based on needs *)
    (* Number of iterations can also be adjusted depending on the desired accuracy *)
    
    (* Using a Do loop to iterate and improve the guess for the square root *)
    Do[guess = (guess + x/guess)/2,
        {iterations}
    ];

    (* Return the final guess as the square root of the input *)
    Return[guess]
]

(* Example usage of the SquareRoot function *)
