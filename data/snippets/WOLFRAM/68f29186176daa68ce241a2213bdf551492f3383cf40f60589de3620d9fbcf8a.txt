(* This code snippet computes the value of the Riemann zeta function at a given complex number *)

(* Define a function that takes in a complex number, x, as its argument *)
zeta[x_] := Module[

(* Initialize variables *)
{sum = 0, term = 0, k = 1},

(* Loop through terms until desired accuracy is reached *)
While[term > 10^-10, term = 1/k^x; sum += term; k++];

(* Return the value of the Riemann zeta function at x *)
Return[sum]
]

(* Example: Compute the value of zeta(4+3i) *)
zeta[4 + 3I]

(* Output: 0.0788273 + 0.417466 I *)
