(* Define a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. *)
averageList[list_] := (
    (* Use Total function to get sum of numbers in list *)
    total = Total[list];
    (* Use Length function to count number of elements in list *)
    count = Length[list];
    (* Calculate average by dividing total by count *)
    average = total / count;
    (* Return average as output *)
    Return[average]
)

(* Define a list of numbers *)
numbers = {4, 5, 7, 10, 2};

(* Call the averageList function with our list of numbers as the argument *)
average = averageList[numbers];

(* Print the result *)
Print[average];

(* Output: 5.6 *)
