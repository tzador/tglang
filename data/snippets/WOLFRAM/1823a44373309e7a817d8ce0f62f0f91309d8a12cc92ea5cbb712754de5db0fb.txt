(*This code snippet is used to calculate the derivative of a function*)
(*Input the function to be differentiated*)
f[x_]:= 2x^3 + 5x + 3 
(*Input the value of x at which the derivative is to be calculated*)
a= 4 
(*Calculate the derivative using the limit definition*)
Derivative[f[x],x]= Limit[(f[x+h]-f[x])/h, h->0] 
(*Substitute the value of x*)
Derivative[f[a],x] 
(*Output the result*)
Result= 76
