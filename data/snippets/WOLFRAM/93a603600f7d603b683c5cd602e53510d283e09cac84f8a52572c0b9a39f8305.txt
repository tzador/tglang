(* Define a function that calculates the power of a number using recursion *)

(* Syntax for defining functions in WOLFRAM: *)

Power[a_, n_Integer] := 
  (* Base case for recursion - if n is zero, return 1 *)
  If[n == 0, 1,
    
    (* Recursive case - multiply 'a' by the power of 'a' raised to n-1 *)
    a*Power[a, n-1]
  ]
  
(* Call the function with base '2' and exponent '5' and store the result in 'power_result' *)

power_result = Power[2, 5]

(* The output will be 32, as 2^5 is 32 *)
