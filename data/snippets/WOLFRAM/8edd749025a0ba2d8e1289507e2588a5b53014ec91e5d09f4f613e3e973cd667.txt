(* This code snippet creates a function that calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence *)
(* Define the function with one parameter, n *)
Fibonacci[n_Integer] :=
(
    (* Initialize variables to store the first and second terms of the sequence *)
    a = 0;
    b = 1;
    (* Use a for loop to iterate n-2 times, as the first two terms are already assigned *)
    For[i = 1, i < n, i++,
        (* Update the variables to calculate the next term *)
        temp = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
    ];
    (* Return the nth term of the sequence *)
    Return[b];
)

(* Call the function with n = 10 and store the result in a variable *)
result = Fibonacci[10];

(* Print the result *)
print(result);

(* Output: 
These lines are not part of the code snippet, they are just here for explanation purposes.
The function calculates the 10th term of the Fibonacci sequence,
which is 55. The result is then printed. *)
