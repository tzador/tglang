(* This is an example function that calculates the average of a list of numbers *)

average[list_List] := Module[{sum = 0, count = 0},
    (* calculates the sum of all numbers in the list *)
    Do[
        sum += num,
        {num, list}
    ];
    (* counts the number of elements in the list *)
    count = Length[list];

    (* returns the average by dividing the sum by the count *)
    sum/count
]

(* Example usage of the average function *)
list = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Print["The average of ", list, " is ", average[list]];

(* Output: The average of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is 3. *)
