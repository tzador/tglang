(*
This function takes in a list of integers and multiplies them by 2.
It then prints the resulting list of integers in descending order.
*)

MultListBy2[list_] := Module[{newList, sortedList},

(*
Create a new list by multiplying each element in the given list by 2.
*)

newList = list*2;

(*
Sort the elements in the new list in descending order and assign it to a new variable.
*)

sortedList = Sort[newList, Greater];

(*
Print the result of the sorted list.
*)

Print[sortedList];

(* Sample input: {1, 3, 5, 7} *)
MultListBy2[{1, 3, 5, 7}]

(* Output: {14, 10, 6, 2} *)
