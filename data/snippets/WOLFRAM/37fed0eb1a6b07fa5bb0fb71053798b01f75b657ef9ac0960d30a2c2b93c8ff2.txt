(* Defining a function called 'fibonacci' that takes in an integer 'n' as a parameter *)
fibonacci[n_] := 

(* Using a conditional to set the initial values of the fibonacci sequence *)
If[n == 0 || n == 1,
    Return[n],
    
    (* If n is greater than 1, recursively call the 'fibonacci' function on n-1 and n-2 and add the results together *)
    Return[fibonacci[n-1] + fibonacci[n-2]]
]

(* Printing the first 10 numbers in the fibonacci sequence *)
Table[fibonacci[i], {i, 0, 9}]

(* Output: {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34} *)
