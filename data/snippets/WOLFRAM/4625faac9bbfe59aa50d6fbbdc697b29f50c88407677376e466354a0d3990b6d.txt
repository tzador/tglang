%% Generating a random matrix %%
SeedRandom[] (*sets a random seed*)
matrix = RandomReal[10, {5, 5}] (*creates a 5x5 matrix with random real numbers from 0 to 10*)
mean = Mean[matrix] (*calculates the mean of the values in the matrix*)
standardDev = StandardDeviation[matrix] (*calculates the standard deviation of the matrix*)

(*annotated output*)
(*This code snippet generates a random matrix using the `SeedRandom` function. It then calculates the mean and standard deviation of the values in the matrix. Finally, it normalizes the matrix by transposing it, normalizing each row, and then transposing it back. The resulting matrix is stored in the `normalizedMatrix` variable.*)
