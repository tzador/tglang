(* This program calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive function *)
(* Define the recursive function to calculate the nth term *)
Fib[n_] := If[n == 1 || n == 0, Return[n], Return[Fib[n-1] + Fib[n-2]]]

(* Ask user for input of which term to calculate *)
Print["Enter the term number to be calculated:"]
n = Input[]

(* Call the recursive function to calculate the nth term *)
result = Fib[n]

(* Print the result of the calculation *)
Print["The " <> ToString[n] <> "th term of the Fibonacci sequence is: " <> ToString[result]]

(* Output: The 10th term of the Fibonacci sequence is: 55 *)
