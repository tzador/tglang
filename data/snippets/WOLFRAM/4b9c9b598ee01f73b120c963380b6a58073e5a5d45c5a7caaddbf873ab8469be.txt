(*This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the determinant of a square matrix using Wolfram Language*)

(*First, we define a function that takes in a square matrix as an input and returns its determinant*)

computeDeterminant[mat_] := Module[{},
  (*First, we check if the input matrix is a square matrix*)
  
  If[Length[mat] != Length[mat[[1]]], Print["Error: Input matrix is not a square matrix!"]; Return[]];
  
  (*Next, we check if the matrix is 2x2, as the determinant of a 2x2 matrix can be easily calculated*)
  
  If[Length[mat] == 2, Return[(mat[[1,1]]*mat[[2,2]]) - (mat[[1,2]]*mat[[2,1]])]];
  
  (*If the matrix is larger than 2x2, we use the Laplace expansion method to calculate the determinant*)
  
  With[{row = mat[[1]]}, (*We choose the first row as our pivot row*)
      
      (*Next, we create a matrix of minors, which is obtained by removing the pivot row and column*)
      
      minors = Map[Delete[#, 1]&, Delete[mat, 1]];
      
      (*Then, we create a list of cofactors, which is obtained by multiplying each element in the minors matrix by its corresponding cofactor sign*)
      
      cofactors = MapIndexed[If[EvenQ@Plus @@ #2, #, -#]&, minors];
      
      (*Finally, we multiply the elements in the pivot row by their corresponding cofactor, and then sum them to obtain the determinant*)
      
      Total[row*cofactors]
    ]
]

(*Now, we define a test matrix and use our function to calculate its determinant*)

testMat = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
computeDeterminant[testMat] (*Expected output: 0*)
