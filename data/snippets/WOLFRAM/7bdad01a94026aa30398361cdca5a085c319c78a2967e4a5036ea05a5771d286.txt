(* Define a function that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in n-dimensional space *)

euclideanDistance[point1_, point2_] := Module[{dist, sum, i},
    (* Calculate the difference between each coordinate in the two points *)
    dist = point1 - point2;
    
    (* Calculate the squared difference for each coordinate *)
    dist = dist^2;
    
    (* Sum up all the squared differences *)
    sum = Total[dist];
    
    (* Take the square root of the sum to get the Euclidean distance *)
    Sqrt[sum]
]

(* Example usage: calculate the Euclidean distance between (2, 3, 4) and (5, 1, 8) *)
euclideanDistance[{2, 3, 4}, {5, 1, 8}]

(* Output: 5 *)
