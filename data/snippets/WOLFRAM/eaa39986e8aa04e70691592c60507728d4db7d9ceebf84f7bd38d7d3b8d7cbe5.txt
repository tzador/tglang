Module[
    {n = 10, a = {-1, 2}, b = {3, 4}, c = {0, 1, 2}},
    Function[{x, y}, (x^2 + y) / (1 - x + y^2 + a.b.c / Sqrt[n])]
]

Explanation:

This is a module written in the WOLFRAM programming language. The module takes in three variables - n, a, and b - and assigns them specific values. It then defines a function with two parameters, x and y, and returns the result of a mathematical expression involving these parameters and the previously assigned variables. The expression calculates the ratio of (x^2 + y) to (1 - x + y^2 + a.b.c / Sqrt[n]). The result is returned as the output of the function. This function can then be called with different values for x and y, and it will return the corresponding calculation. The use of a module allows for encapsulation and modularity in the code, making it easier to read and maintain.
