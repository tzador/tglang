(* Define list of numbers *)
numbers = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};

(* Loop through list and calculate the square of each number *)
For[i = 1, i <= Length[numbers], i++,
    square = numbers[[i]]^2;
    Print["The square of ", numbers[[i]], " is ", square];
]

(* Output:
The square of 2 is 4
The square of 4 is 16
The square of 6 is 36
The square of 8 is 64
The square of 10 is 100
