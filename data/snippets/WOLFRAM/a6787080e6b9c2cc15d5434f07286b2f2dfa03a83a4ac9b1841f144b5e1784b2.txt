(* This code snippet generates a random matrix of size 5x5 and calculates its transpose *)

(* Define a function to generate a random number between -10 and 10 *)
RandomNumber[] := RandomInteger[{-10, 10}]

(* Create a 5x5 array and fill it with random numbers *)
matrix = Table[RandomNumber[], {5}, {5}];

(* Print the original matrix *)
Print["Original Matrix:"];
matrix

(* Calculate the transpose of the matrix *)
transpose = Transpose[matrix];

(* Print the transposed matrix *)
Print["Transposed Matrix:"];
transpose
