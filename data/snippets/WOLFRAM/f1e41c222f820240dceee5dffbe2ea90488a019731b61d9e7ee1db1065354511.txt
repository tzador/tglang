(* Define a function that calculates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence *)

f[0] := 0; (* Set the first value in the sequence to 0 *)
f[1] := 1; (* Set the second value in the sequence to 1 *)
f[n_] := f[n-1] + f[n-2]; (* Define the recursive formula for the sequence *)

(* Define a variable to hold the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate *)
n = 10;

(* Loop through all values from 0 to n and print out the corresponding Fibonacci number *)
For[i = 0, i <= n, i++,
    Print[f[i]];
