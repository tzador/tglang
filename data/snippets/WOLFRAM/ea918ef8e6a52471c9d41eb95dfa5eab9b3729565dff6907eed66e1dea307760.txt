(* This program calculates the n-th term in the Fibonacci sequence *)
(* Define a function named fibonacci, with a parameter n representing the term number *)
fibonacci[n_] := (
    (* Use conditionals to define the first two terms as 0 and 1 *)
    If[n == 1, Return[0], If[n == 2, Return[1]]];
    (* Use recursion to define the following terms *)
    fibonacci[n-1] + fibonacci[n-2]
)
(* Prompt user to enter the term number they want to calculate *)
Print["Enter the term number: "];
(* Take input from user and store it in a variable *)
termNumber = Input[];
(* Call the fibonacci function with the input variable *)
