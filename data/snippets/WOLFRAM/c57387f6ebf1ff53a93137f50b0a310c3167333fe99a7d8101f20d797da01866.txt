(* This code snippet calculates the Taylor series for the sine function *)

(* Define a function to calculate factorial *)
factorial[n_] := If[n == 0, 1, n*factorial[n - 1]]

(* Define the Taylor series function and set n to the desired degree *)
taylorSeries[n_] := Sum[(-1)^k/factorial[2k + 1]*(x)^(2k + 1), {k, 0, n}]

(* Set the value of x for which to calculate the Taylor series *)
x = Pi/4

(* Calculate and print the Taylor series for x *)
Print["The Taylor series for sin(x) up to degree ", n, " at x = ", x, " is:"]
Print["sin(x) ≈ ", HoldForm[taylorSeries[n]], " = ", N[taylorSeries[n] /. x -> x]]

(* Output:

(* Output:
The Taylor series for sin(x) up to degree n at x = Pi/4 is:
sin(x) ≈ n ∑ k=0 (-1)^k /(2k+1)! * x ^(2k+1) = 0.707107

*Note: Replace n with the desired degree of the Taylor series for more accurate results.*
