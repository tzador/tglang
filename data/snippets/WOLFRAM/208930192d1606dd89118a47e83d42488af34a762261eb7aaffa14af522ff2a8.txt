(* This code snippet implements a function to calculate the summation of a list of numbers*)
(* The input list is given as a list of arguments x1, x2, ..., xn *)

(* set initial value for summation *)
sum = 0

(* loop through each element in list using Wolfram's Table function *)
Table[
   (* add current element to sum *)
   sum = sum + x;

   (* output sum after each iteration *)
   Print["Current sum: ", sum],

   (* specify list to be iterated through *)
   {x, {x1, x2, ..., xn}}
]

(* output final sum after all elements have been iterated through *)
Print["Final sum: ", sum]

(* The output should be in the form of the following marked down code snippet:
