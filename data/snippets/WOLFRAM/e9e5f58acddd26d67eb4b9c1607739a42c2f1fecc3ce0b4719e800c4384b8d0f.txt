(*Define a function that finds the factorial of a given number*)

factorial[n_Integer /; n >= 0] := (
    (*If n is 0, return 1*)
    If[n == 0, 1,
        (*Otherwise, recursively calculate the factorial by multiplying n with the factorial of n-1*)
        n * factorial[n - 1]
    ]
)

(*Example: Find the factorial of 5*)
factorial[5]
