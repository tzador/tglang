(* This code snippet calculates the area of a circle given its radius *)

(* Define a function called `circleArea` that takes in one parameter, `r` which represents the radius of the circle*)
circleArea[r_] :=
(
  (* Use the built-in constant `Pi` to represent the value of pi *)
  pi = Pi;
  (* Calculate the area of the circle using the formula `area = pi * radius^2` *)
  area = pi * r^2;
  (* Output the calculated area using the `Print` function *)
  Print["The area of the circle with radius ", r, " is ", area];
)

(* Call the `circleArea` function with a radius of 5 *)
circleArea[5]

(* Output:
The area of the circle with radius 5 is 78.5398
*)
