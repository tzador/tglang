(* This is a function which calculates the factorial of a given integer *)

(* First, we define the function *)
factorial[n_Integer] := 
Module[{result = 1, i}, (* We initiate a variable 'result' with the value of 1 and create a local variable 'i' *)
For[i = 1, i <= n, i++, (* This for loop iterates through all the numbers starting from 1 till n *)
result = result * i; (* The result is multiplied by each number iterated *)
];
result (* The final result is returned *)

(* Now, we can call the function to calculate the factorial of a specific number *)
factorial[5] (* This should return the value of 5! which is 120 *)
