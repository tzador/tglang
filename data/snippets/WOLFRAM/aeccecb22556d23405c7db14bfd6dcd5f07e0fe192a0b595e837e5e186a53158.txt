(* This code snippet uses the Wolfram Language and demonstrates a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number *)

(* Define the recursive function with the name "factorial" and a single parameter "n" *)
factorial[n_] :=
    If[n == 0, 1, n * factorial[n-1]]

(* Define a variable "num" with the input of the number whose factorial we want to calculate *)
num = 5;

(* Call the "factorial" function with the value of "num" as the argument *)
factorial[num]

(* Set the output to a variable "result" *)
result = factorial[num]

(* Print the result with an annotation explaining what it represents *)
Print["The factorial of " <> ToString[num] <> " is " <> ToString[result]]
