(* This code snippet creates a function to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion *)

(* Function to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence *)
fibonacci[n_] := 
Module[{fib}, 
fib[1] = 0; (* First number in the sequence *)
fib[2] = 1; (* Second number in the sequence *)
fib[i_] := fib[i - 2] + fib[i - 1]; (* Recursive formula to calculate subsequent numbers *)

(* Return the nth number in the sequence *)
fib[n]
]

(* Example: Calculate the 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence *)
fibonacci[10]

(* Output: 34, as the 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 34 *)
