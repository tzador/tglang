(* This program calculates the area of a circle given its radius *)

(* Define a function to calculate the area based on given radius *)
CircleArea[r_] := Pi * r^2

(* Take user input for the radius *)
Print["Enter the radius of the circle: "];
radius = Input[];

(* Calculate the area using the defined function *)
area = CircleArea[radius];

(* Print the result *)
Print["The area of the circle with radius ", radius, " is ", area];
