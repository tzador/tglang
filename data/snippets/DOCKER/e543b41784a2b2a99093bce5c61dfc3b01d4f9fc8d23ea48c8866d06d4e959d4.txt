# This is a sample Dockerfile for a Node.js application
# It uses a multi-stage build to create a smaller final image
# with only the necessary dependencies and code.

### STAGE 1: Build ###
FROM node:12-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache make gcc g++ python # install build dependencies
RUN npm install # install Node.js dependencies
COPY . .
RUN npm run build # build the application

### STAGE 2: Run ###
FROM node:12-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/package*.json ./
RUN npm install --only=production # install only production dependencies
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/dist ./dist # copy built files from previous stage
CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
