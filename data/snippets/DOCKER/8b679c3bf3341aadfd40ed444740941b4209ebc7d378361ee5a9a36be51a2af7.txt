# The `Dockerfile` is a text file that contains the commands needed to build a Docker image.
# To start, we will use the `FROM` command to specify the base image we want to use.
# In this example, we will use the `ubuntu` base image.
FROM ubuntu

# Next, we will use the `RUN` command to run a shell command within the image.
# Here, we are updating the package list and installing `curl` and `wget`.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl wget

# Now, let's create a new directory within the image and then change our working directory to that directory.
RUN mkdir /my_directory
WORKDIR /my_directory

# We can also copy files into the image using the `COPY` command.
# Here, we are copying a `script.sh` file from our local machine to the `/my_directory` folder in the image.
COPY script.sh /my_directory

# We can even specify environment variables using the `ENV` command.
# This will be useful for setting up our application later on.
ENV ENV_VAR=value

# The `EXPOSE` command can be used to specify which port our application will run on.
# This is important for setting up networking between containers.
EXPOSE 8080

# Finally, we use the `CMD` command to specify the default command that will be run when the container is started.
# In this case, we are running our `script.sh` file when the container starts running.
CMD ["./script.sh"]
