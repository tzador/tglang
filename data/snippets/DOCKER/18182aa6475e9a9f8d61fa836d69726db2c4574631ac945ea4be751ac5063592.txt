CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
# CMD sets the default command to be executed when the container launches.
# In this case, we are running nginx with the "-g" flag, which sets the value of a configuration option, and the "daemon off" setting, which disables the background process.
# The triple backticks indicate that this line is part of a Dockerfile, which is a file containing instructions for building a Docker image.
