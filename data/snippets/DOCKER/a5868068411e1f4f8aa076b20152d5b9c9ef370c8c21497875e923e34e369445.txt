`# This `is` a sample Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:18.04  # Sets the base image to Ubuntu 18.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \  # Updates and installs packages
    python3 \  # Installs Python 3
    python3-pip \  # Installs pip
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  # Removes apt-get cache to reduce image size

WORKDIR /app  # Sets working directory to /app

COPY requirements.txt /app  # Copies requirements.txt file from local directory to /app in container

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt  # Installs dependencies from requirements.txt

COPY . /app  # Copies all files from local directory to /app in container

CMD ["python3", "app.py"]  # Sets the default command to run when the container starts

EXPOSE 8000  # Exposes port 8000

LABEL maintainer="John Smith <john@example.com>"  # Sets the maintainer label to John Smith's email address`

Note: This is a sample Dockerfile that installs Python 3 and necessary dependencies, copies all files from the local directory to the container, and sets the default command to run the application. It also exposes port 8000 and sets the maintainer label. This is just a basic example and may not be suitable for all applications. Please refer to Docker's documentation for more information on creating the Dockerfile that best suits your needs.
