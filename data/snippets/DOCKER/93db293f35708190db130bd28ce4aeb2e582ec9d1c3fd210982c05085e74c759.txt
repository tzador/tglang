# Create a Dockerfile for a Node.js app

FROM node:alpine # specifies the base image to use

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy remaining app files to the working directory
COPY . .

# Set environment variables
ENV PORT=3000
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Expose the app's port. This does not actually publish the port, it only documents that it is intended to be published
EXPOSE $PORT

# Run the app when the container is started
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]

# To build and run the docker image:

# 1. Build the image and tag it with the name "my-node-app"
# docker build -t my-node-app .

# 2. Run the image in a container and map the container's port 3000 to the host's port 3000
# docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
