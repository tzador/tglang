# This is a Dockerfile for a Node.js application

# Use official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:12-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the dependencies from the package.json file
RUN npm install

# Copy all the files from the current directory to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose the port that the application will run on
EXPOSE 3000

# Set the command to run the application when the container starts
CMD ["node", "index.js"]

# Build the image using the specified Dockerfile
# Example: docker build -t my-node-app .
# The . at the end indicates the build context is the current directory
# This will look for a file named Dockerfile in the current directory
# and use that to build the image
# .dockerignore file can be used to exclude files from the build context
