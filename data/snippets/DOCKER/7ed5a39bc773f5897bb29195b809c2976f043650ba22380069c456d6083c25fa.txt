#This is a Dockerfile that creates a custom nginx image with custom html
FROM nginx:latest
#specify the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

COPY index.html .
#Expose port 80, which is the default port for nginx
EXPOSE 80
#execute nginx command to start the nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
#build the Docker image using this Dockerfile
#replace "customnginx" with your desired image name
#replace "latest" with your desired tag
#be sure to include a period at the end, indicating the current directory
#the resulting Docker image will be tagged as "customnginx:latest"
