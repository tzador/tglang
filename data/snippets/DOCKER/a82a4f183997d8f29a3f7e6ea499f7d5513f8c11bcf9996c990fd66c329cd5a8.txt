FROM ubuntu:latest
# This is a comment indicating that we are using the latest Ubuntu image as base

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
# This command runs the update and install commands for Nginx server on the Ubuntu image
# The -y flag is used to automatically answer yes to any prompts during installation

COPY ./index.html /var/www/html/
# This command copies the index.html file from our local machine to the designated location on the container, specifically the html directory of Nginx server

EXPOSE 80
# This command exposes port 80 on the container, allowing it to receive and respond to HTTP requests

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
# This command sets the default command for the container, which will start the Nginx server with the specified configuration

# To build and run the container, use the following commands:
# docker build -t my-nginx .
# docker run -d -p 80:80 my-nginx
# The -t flag tags the container with the given name (my-nginx in this case)
# The -d flag runs the container in detached mode, allowing it to run in the background
# The -p flag maps the container's port 80 to the same port on the host machine
