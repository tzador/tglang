# This is a multi-stage Dockerfile
# It builds the Docker image in multiple stages, reducing the overall image size
# Stage 1: Building the codebase
FROM node:12 as builder
# Setting the working directory to the codebase folder in the container
WORKDIR /codebase
# Copying the package.json and package-lock.json files into the container at the codebase directory
COPY package*.json ./
# Installing the dependencies
RUN npm install
# Copying the rest of the codebase into the container at the codebase directory
COPY . .
# Building the codebase
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Creating the production-ready image
FROM nginx:1.17.8
# Copying the built codebase from the previous stage into the nginx image
COPY --from=builder /codebase/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
# Exposing the default port of nginx
EXPOSE 80
# Starting nginx when the container is run
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
