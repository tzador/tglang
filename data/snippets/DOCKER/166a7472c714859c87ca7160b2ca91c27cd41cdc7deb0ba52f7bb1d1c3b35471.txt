# A Dockerfile that sets up a basic web server running nginx
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Replace 'username' with your desired username in the USER command
# 2. Place your html files in the html directory before building the image
# 3. Build the image with the command 'docker build -t webserver .'
# 4. Run the image with the command 'docker run -p 80:80 webserver'
#

# Use the latest official nginx image as the base image
FROM nginx:latest

# Set the maintainer information
LABEL maintainer="Your Name <your_email@domain.com>"

# Create a new user to run nginx as non-root
RUN useradd -m -U -s /bin/bash username

# Set the working directory as the nginx html directory
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy all html files from the host's html directory to the container's html directory
COPY html/* .

# Change ownership of the html directory to the new user
RUN chown -R username:username /usr/share/nginx/html

# Switch to the new user
USER username

# Expose port 80 to allow outside access to the web server
