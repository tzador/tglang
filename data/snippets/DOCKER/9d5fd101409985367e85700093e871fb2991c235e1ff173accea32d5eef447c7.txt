# This is a multi-stage Dockerfile that builds a basic NodeJS application.
# It uses two stages - the first stage is for building the application, and the second stage is for production deployment.

# Stage 1: Build
# Use the official NodeJS image as the base image
FROM node:latest as build-stage

# Create a working directory for the application
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy all other application files to the working directory
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production
# Use the official NGINX image as the base image
FROM nginx:latest as production-stage

# Copy the built application files from the build stage
COPY --from=build-stage /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 for application access
EXPOSE 80

# Start the NGINX server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
