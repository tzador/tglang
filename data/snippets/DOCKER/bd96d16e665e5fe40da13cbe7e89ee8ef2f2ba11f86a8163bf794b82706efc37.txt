# This is a sample Dockerfile
# It sets up an nginx server and copies in an html file

# Start with the nginx base image
FROM nginx 

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy the index.html file from the current directory into the container
COPY index.html .

# Expose port 80 to allow incoming traffic to the server
EXPOSE 80 

# Set an environment variable to store the name of the host machine
ENV HOST_NAME=my-nginx-server 

# Run a command to update the package lists and install curl and wget
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl wget 

# Run a bash command to download a package and save it as an Apache config file
RUN bash -c 'wget -O /etc/nginx/conf.d/my.conf http://example.com/my.conf' 

# Override the default nginx configuration file with our custom one
COPY default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf 

# Set a label for the image to provide some metadata
LABEL maintainer="John Doe"

# Set a health check for the container to periodically check the server status
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1

# Start the nginx server as the default process when the container is started
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
