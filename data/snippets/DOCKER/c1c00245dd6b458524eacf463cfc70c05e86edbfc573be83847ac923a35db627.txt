# This is a sample Dockerfile for building a Python web application container

FROM python:3.8.2-alpine # this is the base image we are using

RUN mkdir /app # creates a directory named 'app' inside the container

WORKDIR /app # sets the working directory to 'app'

COPY requirements.txt /app # copies the requirements file into the container

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt # installs all the dependencies from the requirements file

COPY . /app # copies all the files in the current directory to the 'app' directory in the container

EXPOSE 8000 # exposes port 8000 on the container

CMD ["python", "app.py"] # runs the 'app.py' file using python when the container is started
