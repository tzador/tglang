# Define the base image
FROM node:alpine

# Specify the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy files from local directory to container's working directory
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN yarn install

# Build the application
RUN yarn build

# Define the base image for the final container
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy build files from previous stage
COPY --from=0 /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 for web traffic
EXPOSE 80

# Start nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
