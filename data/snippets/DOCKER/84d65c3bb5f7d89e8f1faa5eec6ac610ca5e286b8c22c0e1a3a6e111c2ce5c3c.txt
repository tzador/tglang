# This is a Dockerfile
# It is used to build a Docker image of an application
# The code snippet below defines the steps for building the image

# First, specify the base image for our application
FROM ubuntu:18.04 

# Set the working directory inside the container
# This is where all the subsequent commands will be executed 
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application source code into the container
COPY . .

# Install any dependencies required for the application
# Here, we are installing Python and its dependencies 
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip 

# Install the required packages for our application
# We are using a requirements.txt file to specify the packages 
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt 

# Expose the port on which our application will run 
EXPOSE 8000

# Define the command that will run when the container is started
CMD [ "python3", "app.py" ]
