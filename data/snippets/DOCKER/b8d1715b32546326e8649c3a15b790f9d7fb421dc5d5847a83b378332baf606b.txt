# This Dockerfile creates a custom NGINX web server image with a Node.js application

# Use the official NGINX image as base
FROM nginx

# Set the working directory to the NGINX document root
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy the Node.js application code into the container
COPY app.js .

# Install Node.js and the necessary dependencies
# This step could be skipped if the container will only serve static files
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && \
	curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | bash - && \
	apt-get install -y nodejs && \
	npm install

# Expose port 80 for NGINX
EXPOSE 80

# Set the command to start NGINX and run the Node.js application
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"] & node app.js
