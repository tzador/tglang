# This snippet creates a Dockerfile for a Flask application
# It starts with a base image of Python 3.8 and sets the working directory
# It then installs necessary dependencies and copies the Flask app files to the container
# Sets environment variables and exposes port 5000
# Finally, sets the command to run the Flask app when the container is started
