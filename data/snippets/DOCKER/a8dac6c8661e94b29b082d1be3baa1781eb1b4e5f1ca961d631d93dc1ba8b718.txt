# This is a Dockerfile that builds a custom image for a python web application.
# It uses multiple stages to build and run the application efficiently.

# First stage - building the application
FROM python:3.9-slim as builder

WORKDIR /app  # sets the working directory to 'app'

COPY requirements.txt .  # copies the requirements file to the working directory
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  # installs the python dependencies

COPY . .  # copies all the source code to the working directory

RUN python setup.py install  # runs the setup file to install the application

# Second stage - running the application
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app  # sets the working directory to 'app'

COPY --from=builder /app/ .  # copies the built application from the first stage to the working directory
CMD ["python", "app.py"]  # defines the command to run when the container is started
