# This is a Dockerfile that sets up a web server using NGINX

# We start with a base image that has NGINX installed
FROM nginx

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy the index.html file into the working directory of the container
COPY index.html .

# Install any necessary dependencies for our web application
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

# Set environment variables for our application
ENV PORT 80
ENV ENVIRONMENT production

# Expose port 80 so we can access our web server from outside the container
EXPOSE 80

# Define a command that will start our NGINX server when the container is run
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

# We can also provide a healthcheck for our container
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5s --timeout=3s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:${PORT} || exit 1

# Finally, we can add some labels to provide information about our image
