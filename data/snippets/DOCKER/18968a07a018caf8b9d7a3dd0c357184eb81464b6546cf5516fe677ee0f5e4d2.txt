# This is a Dockerfile that creates a Python app
# with some necessary packages and dependencies

# We use the official python image as our base
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file to the working directory
ADD requirements.txt /app

# Install the requirements
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the files to the working directory
COPY . /app

# Set the environment variable for the app port
# This will allow us to access our app from outside the container
ENV PORT=5000

# Expose the port to the outside world
EXPOSE $PORT

# Run the app when the container is started
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
