field_1,field_2,field_3 # Defines the fields in the CSV file separated by commas
value_1,value_2,value_3 # Defines the values for each field separated by commas
"string value","1234",boolean_value # Strings and numbers can be included in quotes
# Spaces and special characters can also be included in quotes like this:
"special characters: !@#$%^&*()-=_+[]\|;':,./<>?"

# Comments can be added using the '#' symbol
"quoted,field","another ""quoted"" field",unquoted_field # Quotes within strings can be escaped
"multi-line
string","1234","true" # CSV files support multi-line strings by using line breaks within quotes
# Empty fields can be included as follows:
,, # The double comma indicates an empty field
NULL, "", empty_value # Null/Empty values can also be specified using empty quotes or the keyword 'NULL'
# CSV files can also have headers that label the fields in the first row:
field_1,field_2,field_3
value_1,value_2,value_3
# Headers are helpful when working with large amounts of data, as they provide context for the fields
# Rows can also be separated using different delimiters, such as a semicolon instead of a comma:
field_1;field_2;field_3
value_1;value_2;value_3
# CSV files are commonly used in data analysis and can be easily imported and exported using various programs and tools.
