"""CSV Module
The CSV module can be used to read and write CSV files in python. Below is an example of how to use the CSV Module to read data from a CSV file and print out the contents in a formatted manner.

Example:
import csv

with open('my_data.csv', 'r') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
    for row incsv_reader:
        print(f'{row[0]} is from {row[1]} and their favorite color is {row[2]}.')

Output:
John is from New York and their favorite color is blue.
Emily is from Los Angeles and their favorite color is green.
Samantha is from Chicago and their favorite color is red.
