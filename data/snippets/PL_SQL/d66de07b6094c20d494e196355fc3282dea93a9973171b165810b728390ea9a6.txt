-- This is a sample code snippet for PL/SQL which declares variables, 
-- performs a calculation and outputs the result.

  -- Declaring two variables of type NUMBER
  n1 NUMBER := 10;
  n2 NUMBER := 5;

  -- Declaring a variable to hold the result of the calculation
  result NUMBER;

BEGIN

  -- Performing the calculation and storing the result in the 'result' variable
  result := n1 * n2;

  -- Outputting the result to the console
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The result of the calculation is ' || result);
