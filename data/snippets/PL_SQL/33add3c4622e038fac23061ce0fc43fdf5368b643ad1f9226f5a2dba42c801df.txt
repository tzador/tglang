   This code snippet is a complex query that calculates and displays the total sales for each product 
   within a given time period. It also includes a subquery to retrieve the current inventory count for 
   each product and calculates the profit margin for each product.

   The output columns are as follows:
   - Product Name
   - Total Sales
   - Current Inventory
   - Profit Margin
