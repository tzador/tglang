-- This is a PL/SQL code snippet for creating a table with constraints
-- Start of code
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees(
    employee_id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, -- Employee ID column with not null and primary key constraints
    employee_name VARCHAR2(30), -- Employee name column with default length
    salary NUMBER(8,2) CHECK (salary > 0), -- Salary column with limit and check constraint
    department_id INTEGER, -- Department ID column with no constraints
    CONSTRAINT dep_fk FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id) -- Foreign key constraint linking department_id to departments table
        ON DELETE CASCADE -- Cascade on delete option for foreign key constraint
);
-- End of code
