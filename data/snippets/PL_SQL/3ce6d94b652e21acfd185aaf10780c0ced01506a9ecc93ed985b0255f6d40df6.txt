-- This is a code snippet in PL/SQL that creates a stored procedure to update employee salaries based on their performance rating

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_salary

)
IS
  v_salary NUMBER;
BEGIN
  IF p_rating = 'Excellent' THEN

-- This stored procedure takes in two parameters: employee ID and performance rating
-- The procedure will update the employee's salary based on their performance rating using a multiplier
-- If the performance rating is 'Excellent', the salary will be increased by 10%
-- If the performance rating is 'Good', the salary will be increased by 5%
-- If the performance rating is anything else, the salary will be increased by 2%
-- The updated salary will be stored in a variable v_salary and then used to update the employee's record in the employees table
-- The procedure is ended with a backslash ("/") to indicate the end of the procedure
