/* This creates a new table called 'customers' with four columns - id, name, email, and phone_number. The 'id' column is our primary key, meaning it uniquely identifies each row in the table. The 'name' and 'email' columns are set to not allow null values, meaning they must have a value entered for each row. The 'phone_number' column is also not allowed to have a null value, and it is set to be a number data type. */
