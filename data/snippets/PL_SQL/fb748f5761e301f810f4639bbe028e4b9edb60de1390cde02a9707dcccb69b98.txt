--This code snippet creates a table called 'mytable' with columns for id, name, age, and address.
--The 'id' column is set as the primary key.
--The next three INSERT statements add rows to the 'mytable' table with values for name, age, and address.
--Finally, a SELECT statement is used to retrieve the name, age, and address of all rows in the table, ordered by age in descending order.
