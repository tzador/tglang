%% Function to calculate Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
% This function takes in a number as input and calculates the Fibonacci sequence 
% up to that number.

function fibonacci(n)
    % Initialize variables
    first = 0;
    second = 1;
    index = 2;
    sequence = zeros(1,n);
    
    % Loop to calculate sequence
    while index <= n
        sequence(index) = first + second;
        first = second;
        second = sequence(index);
        index = index + 1;
    end
    
    % Display sequence
    disp(sequence);
