% Define variables
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; % Create a vector x with values 1-5
y = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]; % Create a vector y with values 6-10
z = [x, y]; % Concatenate vectors x and y to create vector z

% Create a 2x5 matrix M using vectors x and y as its rows
M = [x; y];

% Use a for loop to multiply each element in z by 2 and store the result in a new vector, w
w = zeros(1, length(z)); % Initialize vector w with zeros
for i = 1:length(z) % Iterate through each element in z
    w(i) = z(i) * 2; % Multiply element by 2 and store in w
end

% Use the dot product function to calculate the dot product between vectors x and y
dot_product = dot(x, y); 

% Create a 5x5 identity matrix I
I = eye(5);

% Calculate the element-wise multiplication between matrix M and I
M_elementwise = M .* I;

% Use a while loop to calculate the factorial of a number n
n = 6; % Define n
factorial = 1; % Initialize factorial
while n > 0 % Loop while n is greater than 0
    factorial = factorial * n; % Update factorial by multiplying with n
    n = n - 1; % Decrement n by 1
end

% Define a function to calculate the mean of a vector
function mean = calc_mean(vector)
    total = 0; % Initialize total
    for i = 1:length(vector) % Loop through elements in vector
        total = total + vector(i); % Add each element to total
    end
    mean = total / length(vector); % Calculate mean by dividing total by length of vector
