% Code to generate a random matrix with 10 rows and 10 columns
% Using the randn function in MATLAB
matrix = randn(10,10) % Generates a random matrix with values drawn from a standard normal distribution
disp(matrix) % Displays the matrix in the command window
% Code to calculate the mean of each column in the matrix
meanOfColumns = mean(matrix) % Calculates the mean of each column and stores it in a 1x10 vector
disp(meanOfColumns) % Displays the mean vector in the command window
% Code to calculate the standard deviation of each row in the matrix
stdOfRows = std(matrix,0,2) % Calculates the standard deviation of each row and stores it in a 10x1 vector
disp(stdOfRows) % Displays the standard deviation vector in the command window
