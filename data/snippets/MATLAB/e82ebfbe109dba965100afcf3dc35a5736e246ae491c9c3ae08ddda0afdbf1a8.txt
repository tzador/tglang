%% Batch processing of multiple images
% This code snippet shows how to batch process multiple images in MATLAB. 
% It uses a for loop to iterate through each image, perform a set of operations,
% and save the resulting image with a new name.
% 
% Note: This code assumes that all images are stored in a folder called 'images'
% within the current working directory.

% Define the folder path of the images
folder_path = 'images';

% Get a list of all image files in the folder
image_files = dir(fullfile(folder_path, '*.jpg'));

% Specify the operations to be performed on each image
threshold = 0.75;
blur_radius = 3;

% Set up a for loop to iterate through each image
for i = 1:length(image_files) 
    
    % Read the image
    image = imread(fullfile(folder_path, image_files(i).name));

    % Apply a Gaussian blur with the specified radius
    image_blurred = imgaussfilt(image, blur_radius);

    % Convert the image to grayscale
    image_gray = rgb2gray(image_blurred);

    % Apply a threshold to the image
    image_thresh = imbinarize(image_gray, threshold);

    % Save the processed image with a new name
    new_name = strcat('processed_', image_files(i).name);
    imwrite(image_thresh, new_name);
    
end
