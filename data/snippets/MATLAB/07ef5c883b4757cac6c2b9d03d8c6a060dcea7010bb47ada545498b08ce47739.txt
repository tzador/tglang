%This code snippet uses a for loop to calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
n = input('Enter the number of terms: '); %takes user input for number of terms
F = zeros(n, 1); %initializes a vector to store the terms
F(1) = 0; %sets first term to 0
F(2) = 1; %sets second term to 1
for i = 3:n %for loop to calculate the remaining terms
    F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2); %formula for Fibonacci sequence
end
disp(['The ' num2str(n) 'th term of the Fibonacci sequence is ' num2str(F(n)) '.']); %displays the nth term of Fibonacci sequence
