% Create a 3-dimensional matrix of random integers
% with dimensions of 10-by-5-by-3
A = randi(100,[10,5,3]); 

% Perform element-wise multiplication
B = A.*A; 

% Reshape the matrix into a 2-dimensional matrix
% with the same number of elements
C = reshape(A, [30,5]); 

% Create a new column vector with values ranging from 1 to 30
D = (1:30)'; 

% Perform matrix multiplication between C and D
E = C*D;

% Calculate the inverse of matrix A
% Note: Matrix must be square and non-singular
F = inv(A);

% Extract the diagonal elements of F using logical indexing
G = F(logical(eye(3)));
