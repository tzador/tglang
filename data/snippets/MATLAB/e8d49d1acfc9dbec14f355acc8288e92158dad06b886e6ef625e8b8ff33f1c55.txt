% This is a code snippet in MATLAB
% It contains a complex loop and uses multiple built-in functions
% The snippet calculates the average of a matrix
% Define a matrix with random values
A = rand(5,5);
% Initialize variables for sum and count
sum = 0;
count = 0;
% Loop through each element of the matrix
for i = 1:size(A,1)         % Loop through rows
    for j = 1:size(A,2)     % Loop through columns
        if A(i,j) < 0.5     % Check if element is less than 0.5
            sum = sum + A(i,j);     % Add element to sum
            count = count + 1;      % Increment count
        end
    end
end
% Calculate the average
avg = sum/count;
% Display the average
disp(avg);
