% This is a code to perform linear regression using the least squares method
% Define the data points
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
y = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15];

% Calculate the number of data points
n = length(x);

% Calculate the sums and products for the least squares method
sum_x = sum(x);
sum_y = sum(y);
sum_xy = sum(x.*y);
sum_xx = sum(x.^2);

% Calculate the slope and intercept using the least squares formula
slope = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_xx - sum_x^2);
intercept = (sum_y - slope*sum_x) / n;

% Create a vector of predicted y values using the calculated slope and intercept
y_pred = slope*x + intercept;

% Print the slope and intercept
fprintf("The slope is: %.2f\n", slope);
fprintf("The intercept is: %.2f\n", intercept);

% Plot the original data points and the predicted line of best fit
plot(x, y, 'o'); % plot original data points as circles
hold on; % keep plot open
plot(x, y_pred); % plot predicted line of best fit
