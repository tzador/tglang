% This code snippet uses the matrix manipulation functions in Matlab to generate a random symmetric matrix and perform various operations on it.

% First, we initialize the size of the matrix to be generated
n = 10; % size n x n

% Next, we use the randn function to generate a n x n matrix of random values with a normal distribution
A = randn(n);

% To ensure the matrix is symmetric, we use the triu function to copy the upper triangular elements to the lower triangular elements
A = triu(A) + triu(A,1)'; 

% Now, we can perform various operations on the matrix A
% 1. Finding the trace of A
trace_A = trace(A); % the sum of diagonal elements of A

% 2. Transposing the matrix A
A_transpose = A'; % the transpose of A

% 3. Finding the determinant of A
det_A = det(A); % the determinant of A

% 4. Calculating the inverse of A
A_inverse = inv(A); % the inverse of A

% 5. Multiplying A with its inverse to get the identity matrix
A_identity = A * A_inverse;

% Finally, we print the results of the operations on A
fprintf("The trace of A is %d\n", trace_A);
fprintf("The transpose of A is:\n");
disp(A_transpose);
fprintf("The determinant of A is %d\n", det_A);
fprintf("The inverse of A is:\n");
disp(A_inverse);
fprintf("A multiplied with its inverse gives the identity matrix:\n");
disp(A_identity);
