% This code snippet is a function that performs forward and backward substitution
% It takes in input matrices A and b, and outputs the solution vector x
function x = solve_triangular(A, b)

% Determine the size of matrix A
n = size(A, 1);

% Initialize solution vector x
x = zeros(n, 1);

% Perform forward substitution
for i = 1:n
    % Compute sum of previous coefficients times corresponding solutions
    sum = 0;
    for j = 1:i-1
        sum = sum + A(i,j) * x(j);
    end
    % Compute solution by subtracting sum from corresponding b value
    x(i) = (b(i) - sum) / A(i,i);
end

% Perform backward substitution
for i = n:-1:1
    % Compute sum of previous coefficients times corresponding solutions
    sum = 0;
    for j = i+1:n
        sum = sum + A(i,j) * x(j);
    end
    % Compute solution by subtracting sum from corresponding b value
    x(i) = (b(i) - sum) / A(i,i);
end

% Print solution vector x
disp(x)
