% This code snippet calculates the inverse of a given square matrix using the LU decomposition method

% Assume A is a square matrix whose inverse is to be calculated
A = [2 4 6; 3 6 9; 1 2 3];

% Perform LU decomposition of A
[L, U] = lu(A);

% Calculate the inverse of A using LU decomposition
% Initialize an identity matrix of the same size as A
I = eye(size(A));
 
% Forward substitution to solve for Y
Y = zeros(size(A));
for i = 1:size(A,1)
    Y(i,:) = linsolve(L,I(i,:)');
end

% Backward substitution to solve for X (inverse of A)
X = zeros(size(A));
for i = 1:size(A,1)
    X(i,:) = linsolve(U,Y(i,:)');
end

% Display the inverse of A
disp("The inverse of matrix A is:");
disp(X);
