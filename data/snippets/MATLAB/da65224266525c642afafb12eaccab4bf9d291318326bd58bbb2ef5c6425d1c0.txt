% This code snippet calculates the mean square error (MSE) of a given dataset
% and compares it to a specified threshold to determine if it is acceptable.
% The dataset is represented as a vector of values 'data' and the threshold
% is denoted by the variable 'threshold'.
function mse = calculate_mse(data, threshold)
% initialize mse to 0
mse = 0;
% loop through each value in the dataset
for i = 1:length(data)
    % calculate the difference between the value and the threshold
    diff = data(i) - threshold;
    % square the difference
    squared_diff = diff^2;
    % add the squared difference to the mse value
    mse = mse + squared_diff;
end
% calculate the mean by dividing the mse by the number of values
mse = mse / length(data);
% print the result
fprintf("The MSE of the dataset is: %.2f\n", mse);
% check if the mse is within the acceptable range
if mse <= 0.05
    % if yes, print an appropriate message
    fprintf("The MSE is within the acceptable range.");
else
    % if no, print a warning message
    fprintf("Warning: The MSE is not within the acceptable range.");
