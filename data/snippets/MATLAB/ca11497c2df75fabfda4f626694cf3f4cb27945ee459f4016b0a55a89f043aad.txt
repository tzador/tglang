% This section defines a function that calculates the sum of a given vector
function sum = vectorSum(vector)
% Initializes the sum variable to 0
sum = 0;
% Loops through each element in the vector and adds it to the sum
for i = 1:length(vector)
    sum = sum + vector(i);
end
% Displays the sum in the command window
disp('The sum of the vector is:');
disp(sum);
end
