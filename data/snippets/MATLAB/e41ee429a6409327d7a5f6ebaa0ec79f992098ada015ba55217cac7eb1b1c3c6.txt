% This code snippet creates a function that calculates the area of a triangle
function area = calculateTriangleArea(base, height) % function declaration with inputs
% This function takes in the base and height of the triangle as parameters
area = (1/2) * base * height; % calculates the area using the formula (1/2)*base*height
end % end of function
