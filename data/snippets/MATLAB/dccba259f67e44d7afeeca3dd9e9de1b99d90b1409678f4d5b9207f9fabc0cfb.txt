function [y, x] = arrayMultiply(A, B)
% This function takes in two arrays and multiplies them 
% by using matrix multiplication. It returns the resulting 
% array and also the final value of x that was used in the 
% calculation.

[p, q] = size(B);

if n ~= p

y % final array output
x % final value of x used in calculation
