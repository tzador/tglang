n = 100; % sets the value of n to 100
A = rand(n); % generates a random n by n matrix
b = rand(n,1); % generates a random n by 1 matrix

% solving the system Ax = b using LU decomposition
[L, U] = lu(A); % performs LU decomposition on matrix A
y = L\b; % solves for y in Ly = b
x = U\y; % solves for x in Ux = y

% checking the solution
A*x - b; % should output a matrix filled with very small values
