%% Finding the roots of a polynomial using Newton's method

% Defining the polynomial f(x) = x^3 - 7x + 6
f = @(x) x^3 - 7*x + 6;

% Defining the derivative of f(x) = x^3 - 7x + 6
df = @(x) 3*x^2 - 7;

% Setting the initial guess x0 and maximum number of iterations
x0 = 0;
max_iter = 100;

% Implementing Newton's method to find root
for iter = 1:max_iter
    
    % Calculating the value of f(x0) and df(x0)
    fx0 = f(x0);
    dfx0 = df(x0);
    
    % Updating x0 using Newton's formula
    x0 = x0 - fx0/dfx0;
    
    % Checking for convergence
    if abs(f(x0)) < 0.0001
        break % root has been found
    end
end

% Printing the root
fprintf("The root of the polynomial is: %f", x0);
