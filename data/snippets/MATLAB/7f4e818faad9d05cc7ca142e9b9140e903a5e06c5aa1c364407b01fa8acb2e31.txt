% This code snippet is an example of a while loop in MATLAB.
% It calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

sum = 0; % initialize sum to 0
n = 1; % initialize counter variable
while (n <= 100) % while the counter is less than or equal to 100
    if (mod(n,2) == 0) % if the number is even
        sum = sum + n; % add the number to the sum
    end
    n = n + 1; % increment the counter
end

disp(sum); % display the final sum
