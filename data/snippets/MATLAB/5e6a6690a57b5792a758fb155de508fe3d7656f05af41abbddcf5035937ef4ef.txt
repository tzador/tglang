% Define a vector of random numbers between 1 and 10
rand_vec = randi([1, 10], 1, 10);

% Create a while loop with a condition checking for the mean of the vector being greater than 5
while mean(rand_vec) > 5

    % Use the built-in function to sort the vector in descending order
    sorted_vec = sort(rand_vec, 'descend');

    % Use a for loop to iterate through the elements of the sorted vector
    for i = 1:length(sorted_vec)

        % If the current element is greater than the mean of the vector, replace it with its square root
        if sorted_vec(i) > mean(sorted_vec)
            sorted_vec(i) = sqrt(sorted_vec(i));
        end
    end

    % Update the original vector with the modified sorted vector
    rand_vec = sorted_vec;

    % Print the new vector
    disp("New vector:");
    disp(rand_vec);
end

% Print a message indicating the while loop has ended
disp("End of while loop.");
