function [sorted] = insertion_sort(unsorted)
% This function implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort an unsorted array
% of numbers in ascending order.

% Initialize a variable to hold the size of the unsorted array
n = length(unsorted);

% Loop through the unsorted array from the second element to the end
for i = 2:n
    % Set the current element as the key
    key = unsorted(i);
    % Start with the element before the key
    j = i-1;
    
    % Move all elements that are greater than the key to the right
    while j>0 && unsorted(j)>key
        unsorted(j+1) = unsorted(j);
        j = j-1;
    end
    % Place the key in its correct position
    unsorted(j+1) = key;
end

% Return the sorted array
sorted = unsorted;
end
