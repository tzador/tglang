%% Generate a random symmetric matrix
% This code snippet generates a random symmetric matrix of size n x n, where n is a positive integer.
n = 5; % define the size of the matrix
A = rand(n); % generate a nxn matrix with random numbers
A = (A + A')/2; % make the matrix symmetric by adding its transpose and dividing by 2
disp('The random symmetric matrix A is:'); % display a message indicating the matrix
disp(A); % print the matrix A
