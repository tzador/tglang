% This code snippet creates a function that calculates the matrix exponential using the Taylor series expansion method.

function expmat = matrix_exp(t,A)
% expmat is the matrix exponential output
% t is the time parameter
% A is the matrix input

% Initialize expmat as the identity matrix
expmat = eye(size(A));

% Calculate the matrix exponential using the Taylor series expansion
n = 0;
while true
    % Calculate the next term in the series
    next_term = (1/factorial(n))*(A^n)*(t^n);
    
    % Check if the next term is smaller than machine precision
    if abs(next_term) < eps
        break;
    end
    
    % Add the next term to the matrix exponential
    expmat = expmat + next_term;
    
    % Increase the iteration count
    n = n+1;
end
end
