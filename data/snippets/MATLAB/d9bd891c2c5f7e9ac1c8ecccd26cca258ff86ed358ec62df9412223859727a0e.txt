% This code snippet calculates the moving average of a given vector

% create a vector of random numbers 
a = rand(1,100);

% set the window size for the moving average
window_size = 5;

% initialize a vector to store the moving average values
moving_avg = zeros(1,length(a));

% loop through the vector and calculate moving average at each index
for i = 1:length(a)
    
    % check if index is within the window size
    if i < window_size 
        % calculate the average of the first i elements
        moving_avg(i) = mean(a(1:i));
    
    % calculate the average of the last window_size elements
    else
        moving_avg(i) = mean(a(i-window_size+1:i));
    end
end

% print the moving average values 
disp(moving_avg);
