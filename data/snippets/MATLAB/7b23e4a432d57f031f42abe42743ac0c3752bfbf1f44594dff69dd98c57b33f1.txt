% This code snippet creates a 3D plot of a surface defined by the equation 
% z = x^2 + y^2 over the domain [-5, 5]. The surface is color-coded based 
% on its height, with cooler colors indicating lower heights and warmer 
% colors indicating higher heights.

% Define the range and resolution of the x- and y-axes
xmin = -5;
xmax = 5;
ymin = -5;
ymax = 5;
dx = 0.1;

% Create vectors for the x- and y-axes using the defined range and resolution
x = xmin:dx:xmax;
y = ymin:dx:ymax;

% Create a grid of x- and y-values for the domain
[X, Y] = meshgrid(x, y);

% Calculate the value of z for each point on the grid using the equation 
% z = x^2 + y^2
Z = X.^2 + Y.^2;

% Create a 3D plot of the surface with a colorbar and labeled axes
surf(X, Y, Z)
colorbar % Add a colorbar to show the height values
xlabel('x') % Label the x-axis
ylabel('y') % Label the y-axis
zlabel('z') % Label the z-axis
colormap(jet) % Set the colormap to 'jet' for a range of colors
