function y = intromod(x)
% This function calculates the mod of each element in vector x,
% where the mod is defined as the remainder after division of each element by 5.
% The function returns a vector y with the same size as x.

% Initialize vector y with zeros
y = zeros(size(x));

% Loop through each element in vector x
for i = 1:length(x)
    % Calculate the remainder after dividing the current element by 5
    remainder = mod(x(i), 5);
    
    % Check if the remainder is equal to 0
    if remainder == 0
        % If so, set the corresponding element in y to 5
        y(i) = 5;
    else
        % Otherwise, set the corresponding element in y to the remainder
        y(i) = remainder;
    end
