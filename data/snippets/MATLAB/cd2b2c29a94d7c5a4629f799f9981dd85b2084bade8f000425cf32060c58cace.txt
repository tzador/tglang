% This code snippet generates a random matrix of size 5x5
% with values ranging from 0 to 10 and calculates the sum 
% of the elements in the second row

% Generate a 5x5 matrix of random numbers ranging from 0 to 10
A = randi([0,10],5);

% Create an empty vector to store the values in the second row
second_row = [];

% Loop through the second row of the matrix and add the values to the vector
for i = 1:5
    second_row(i) = A(2,i);
end

% Calculate the sum of the elements in the second row
sum_second_row = sum(second_row);

% Print the sum to the command window
disp(sum_second_row);
