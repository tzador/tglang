%% Generate Power Spectral Density Plot of a Signal with Noise

% Define parameters
Fs = 1000;          % Sampling frequency (Hz)
T = 1/Fs;           % Sampling period (seconds)
L = 500;            % Length of signal
t = (0:L-1)*T;      % Time vector

% Create a signal with noise
S = 0.7*sin(2*pi*50*t) + sin(2*pi*120*t) + 2*randn(size(t));

% Compute Power Spectral Density and frequency domain
Y = fft(S);         % Compute Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the signal
P2 = abs(Y/L);      % Compute two-sided spectral density
P1 = P2(1:L/2+1);   % Extract single-sided spectral density
P1(2:end-1) = 2*P1(2:end-1);    % Multiply by 2 to account for two-sided spectrum
f = Fs*(0:(L/2))/L;  % Define frequency axis

% Plot Power Spectral Density
plot(f,P1)          % Plot single-sided spectrum
