% This code takes in two matrices, A and B, and computes their matrix product using
% the dot and cross product functions in MATLAB.

% Create random matrices A and B of size 3x3
A = rand(3);
B = rand(3);

% Compute the dot product of A and B
dot_product = dot(A,B)

% Compute the cross product of A and B
cross_product = cross(A,B)

% Display the results
disp("The matrix product of A and B is:");
disp(dot_product);
disp("The cross product of A and B is:");
disp(cross_product);
