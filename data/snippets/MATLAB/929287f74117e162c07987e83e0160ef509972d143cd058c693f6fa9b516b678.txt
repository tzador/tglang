%% This section creates a 3D scatter plot of data points
figure; %creates a new figure window
load('data.mat'); %loads data from a .mat file
x = data(:,1); %assigns the first column of the data to the variable x
y = data(:,2); %assigns the second column of the data to the variable y
z = data(:,3); %assigns the third column of the data to the variable z
scatter3(x,y,z,'filled'); %plots the points in a 3D scatter plot with filled markers
xlabel('X'); %labels the x-axis as "X"
ylabel('Y'); %labels the y-axis as "Y"
zlabel('Z'); %labels the z-axis as "Z"
title('Data Points'); %adds a title to the plot
colorbar; %adds a colorbar to the plot
grid on; %turns on the grid lines
box on; %adds a box to the plot
view(40,35); %sets the viewing angle to 40 degrees on the horizontal plane and 35 degrees on the vertical plane
axis square; %sets the axis limits to be equal in all directions
rotate3d on; %enables 3D rotation of the plot using the mouse
box off; %removes the box from the plot
hold on; %keeps the current plot on the axes when adding new plots
%% This section overlays a line plot on top of the scatter plot
line(x,y,z,'Color','r','LineWidth',2); %plots a line connecting the data points with a red color and a line width of 2
legend('Scatter Plot','Line Plot'); %adds a legend to the plot
hold off; %stops the current plot from being added to the axes
