function [out] = matrixOperation(in)
% This function performs a series of matrix operations on the input matrix.
% The input matrix must be a square matrix with at least 2 rows and columns.
% The output is a single value representing the result of the operation.
% The operation involves taking the matrix determinant, then squaring it, 
% and finally finding the sum of the squared values of all elements in the determinant matrix.

% Check input matrix size
if size(in,1) < 2 || size(in,2) < 2 || size(in,1) ~= size(in,2)
    error('Input matrix must be a square matrix with at least 2 rows and columns.');
end

% Calculate determinant of input matrix
det_matrix = det(in);

% Square determinant
squared_det = det_matrix^2;

% Find sum of squared values in determinant matrix
sum_squared_det = sum(sum(det_matrix.^2));

% Calculate resulting value
result = squared_det + sum_squared_det;

% Output result
out = result;
