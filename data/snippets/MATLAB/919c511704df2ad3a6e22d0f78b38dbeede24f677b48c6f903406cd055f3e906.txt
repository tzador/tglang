%% Piecewise Continuity
% This code snippet will perform a piecewise continuity check on multiple
% functions and plot the results on a single figure.
% The piecewise continuity check follows the definition of piecewise
% continuity, where the limit from the left and from the right of a point
% should be equal and the function should be defined at that point.
% The code will first ask the user for the number of functions to check and
% their respective expressions as inputs.
% Then, it will calculate the left and right limits of each function at a
% given point and compare them to determine their continuity.
% Finally, it will plot the results and display the points of discontinuity.

%% User Inputs
% The user will be prompted to enter the number of functions to check and
% their respective expressions. The expressions should be in the form of
% symbolic functions and can contain any valid MATLAB syntax.
num_functions = input('Enter number of functions to check: ');
functions = cell(num_functions, 1);
x = sym('x');
for i = 1:num_functions
    functions{i} = input(['Enter function ', num2str(i), ' as a symbolic function: ']);
end

%% Limits Calculation
% The code will now calculate the left and right limits of each function at
% the point x = 0. The left limits will be calculated by approaching x = 0
% from values smaller than 0 and the right limits by approaching x = 0 from
% values greater than 0.
left_limits = zeros(num_functions, 1);
right_limits = zeros(num_functions, 1);
for i = 1:num_functions
    left_limits(i) = limit(functions{i}, x, 0, 'left');
    right_limits(i) = limit(functions{i}, x, 0, 'right');
end

%% Continuity Check
% The code will now compare the left and right limits for each function to
% determine their continuity. If the limits are equal, the function is
% considered continuous at x = 0. Otherwise, it is considered discontinuous.
is_continuous = abs(left_limits - right_limits) < 1e-12;

%% Plotting Results
% The code will now plot the results on a single figure. The continuous
% functions will be plotted in blue and the discontinuous ones in red. The
% points of discontinuity will also be marked on the graph.
