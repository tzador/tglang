% This code snippet solves a square linear system using the built-in function 'mldivide'
% It first generates a random square matrix of size 100 by 100
% Then, it generates a random vector of length 100
% The square linear system is in the form Ax = b, where A is the matrix and b is the vector
A = rand(100);
b = randn(100,1);
x = A \ b; % solves for x using 'mldivide' function, equivalent to A\b
disp(x); % displays the solution vector x
