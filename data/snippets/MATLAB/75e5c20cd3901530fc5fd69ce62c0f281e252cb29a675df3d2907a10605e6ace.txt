% This is a MATLAB code snippet that uses the "for" loop to calculate the factorial of a number
% We start with the value of n, which is the number whose factorial we want to calculate
n = 5;
% Initialize the factorial value to 1
factorial = 1;
% Using the "for" loop, we iterate from 1 to n and multiply each number with the factorial value 
for i = 1:n
    factorial = factorial * i;
end
% The final value of "factorial" variable will give us the factorial of n
disp(factorial)
