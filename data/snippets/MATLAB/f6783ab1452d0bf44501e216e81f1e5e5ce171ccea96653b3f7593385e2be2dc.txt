% This is a complex code snippet in MATLAB
% It performs calculations and manipulations on matrices
% and uses various built-in functions

% Defines a 5x5 matrix A filled with random numbers
A = rand(5);

% Computes the sum of all elements in matrix A
sum_A = sum(sum(A));

% Creates a new 5x5 matrix B filled with ones
B = ones(5);

% Computes the dot product of matrices A and B
dot_product = dot(A, B);

% Reverses the elements of matrix B
B_reverse = fliplr(B);

% Computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A
[eig_values, eig_vectors] = eig(A);

% Scales matrix A by multiplying it with a scalar value
scaled_A = A .* 10;

% Converts matrix A into a vector by concatenating all rows
A_vector = A(:);

% Sorts the elements of matrix A in ascending order
sorted_A = sort(A(:));

% Reshapes matrix A into a 10x5 matrix by transposing it and then
% reshaping it with the 'reshape' function
reshaped_A = reshape(A', [10, 5]);

% Computes the mean of each column in matrix A
column_mean = mean(A, 1);

% Computes the standard deviation of each row in matrix A
row_std = std(A, 2);
