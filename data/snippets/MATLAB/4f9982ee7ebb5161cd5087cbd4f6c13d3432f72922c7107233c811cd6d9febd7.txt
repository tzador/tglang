% Define a 2D matrix with 5 rows and 3 columns
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9; 10 11 12; 13 14 15];

% Create a vector with the first 4 values of the first column of matrix A
b = A(1:4,1);

% Calculate the mean of vector b
mean_b = mean(b);

% Calculate the standard deviation of vector b
std_b = std(b);

% Define a counter variable
c = 0;

% Use a for loop to iterate through each value in vector b
for i = 1:length(b)
    % Check if the current value is even
    if mod(b(i), 2) == 0
        % If even, increment the counter by 1
        c = c + 1;
    end

% Display the number of even values in vector b
disp(['The number of even values in vector b is ', num2str(c)]);
