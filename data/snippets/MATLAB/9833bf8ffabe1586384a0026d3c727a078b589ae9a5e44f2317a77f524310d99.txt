% Create a matrix with random values

% Compute the inverse of the matrix by multiplying the pseudo-inverse of the singular values with the transpose of the matrix

% Set a threshold value for the eigenvalues

% Use logical indexing to check which eigenvalues are above the threshold and set them to 1, while the rest are set to 0
indices = abs(diag(inv_A)) > threshold;

% Multiply the original matrix with the inverse to get the original matrix back
