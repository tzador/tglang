%% Initializing variables %%
x = 1; % this is a variable x with value 1
y = 2; % this is a variable y with value 2
z = 0:0.1:2*pi; % this is a variable z with a range from 0 to 2pi with increments of 0.1
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9]; % this is a matrix A with three rows and three columns, with values 1 to 9 in order
B = eye(3); % this is a 3 by 3 identity matrix B
C = rand(3,4); % this is a 3 by 4 matrix C with random values between 0 and 1
D = zeros(2,5); % this is a 2 by 5 matrix D with all values set to 0
%% Performing calculations %%
result_1 = x + y; % this calculates the sum of x and y and assigns it to result_1
result_2 = A * B; % this multiplies matrix A and B and assigns the result to result_2
result_3 = exp(z); % this calculates the exponential of all values in z and assigns the result to result_3
result_4 = C' * D; % this multiplies the transpose of matrix C and D and assigns the result to result_4
%% Plotting results %%
figure; % this creates a new figure for plotting
subplot(2,2,1); % this creates a subplot in the first position of a 2 by 2 grid
plot(z, result_3); % this plots z on the x-axis and result_3 on the y-axis
xlabel('x values'); % this labels the x-axis as 'x values'
ylabel('exponential values'); % this labels the y-axis as 'exponential values'
title('Plot of Exponential Values'); % this adds a title to the plot
subplot(2,2,2); % this creates a subplot in the second position of a 2 by 2 grid
surf(A); % this creates a surface plot of matrix A
xlabel('column index'); % this labels the x-axis as 'column index'
ylabel('row index'); % this labels the y-axis as 'row index'
zlabel('matrix values'); % this labels the z-axis as 'matrix values'
title('Surface Plot of Matrix A'); % this adds a title to the plot
subplot(2,2,3); % this creates a subplot in the third position of a 2 by 2 grid
bar(z, result_4); % this creates a bar graph with z on the x-axis and result_4 on the y-axis
xlabel('z values'); % this labels the x-axis as 'z values'
ylabel('product values'); % this labels the y-axis as 'product values'
title('Bar Graph of Product Values'); % this adds a title to the plot
subplot(2,2,4); % this creates a subplot in the fourth position of a 2 by 2 grid
plot(x, y, 'ro-'); % this plots x and y as a red, circular line
xlabel('x'); % this labels the x-axis as 'x'
ylabel('y'); % this labels the y-axis as 'y'
title('Plot of x vs y'); % this adds a title to the plot
