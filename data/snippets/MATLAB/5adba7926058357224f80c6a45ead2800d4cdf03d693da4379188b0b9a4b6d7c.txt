%% Data Pre-processing
% The following code snippet represents a data pre-processing step for a machine learning model in MATLAB.
% The input data is first read and stored in a variable "data".
% A for loop is used to iterate through each row of the data and check for any missing values.
% The missing values are replaced with the mean of the respective column.
% Finally, the data is split into training and testing sets using the "datasample" function.

%% Step 1: Read and store input data
data = readtable("input_data.csv");

%% Step 2: Check for missing values
for i = 1:size(data,1) % Loop through each row of data
    for j = 1:size(data,2) % Loop through each column of data
        if isnan(data(i, j)) % Check if the value is NaN
            data(i, j) = mean(data(:, j)); % Replace with mean of the column
        end
    end
end

%% Step 3: Split data into training and testing sets
[train_data, test_data] = datasample(data, size(data,1)/2, 'Replace', false);
