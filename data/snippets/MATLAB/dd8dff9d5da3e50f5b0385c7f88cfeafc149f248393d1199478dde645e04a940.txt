% This code snippet generates a 2D Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1

% Define the size of the distribution grid
x = -3:0.1:3;
y = -3:0.1:3;

% Create a meshgrid from the defined sizes
[X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y);

% Calculate the probability density function for each point in the grid
gaussian = (1/sqrt(2*pi))*exp(-(X.^2 + Y.^2)/2);

% Plot the distribution in a 3D surface plot
figure;
surf(X,Y,gaussian);
