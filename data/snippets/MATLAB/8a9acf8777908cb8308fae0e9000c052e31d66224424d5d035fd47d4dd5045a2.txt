% This is a code snippet written in MATLAB
% It uses a for loop and conditional statements to calculate the factorial of a number

% Define the number for which factorial needs to be calculated
num = 5;

% Initialize the result variable
fact = 1;

% Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to num
for i = 1:num
    % Check if the current number is 1
    if i == 1
        % Skip the first iteration since 1! = 1
        continue;
    end
    % Multiply the current number with the previous result
    fact = fact * i;
end

% Display the result
fprintf('The factorial of %d is %d', num, fact);
