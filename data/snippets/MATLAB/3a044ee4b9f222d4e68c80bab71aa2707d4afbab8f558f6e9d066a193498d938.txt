x = 5; % Assigning a value of 5 to the variable 'x'
y = 10; % Assigning a value of 10 to the variable 'y'
z = x + y; % The value in the variable 'z' is calculated as x + y
disp(z) % Displays the value of z
for i = 1:5 % A 'for' loop that will run 5 times
    if rem(i, 2) == 0 % Checking if 'i' is divisible by 2 with no remainder
        disp('Even') % Prints 'Even' if the condition is true
    else
        disp('Odd') % Prints 'Odd' if the condition is false
    end
