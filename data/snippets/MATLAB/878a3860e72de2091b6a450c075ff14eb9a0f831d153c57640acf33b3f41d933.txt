% Creating a vector of 10 random numbers between 1 and 50
vector = randi([1,50],[1,10]);

% Initializing an empty array
array = [];

% Looping through the vector and adding even numbers to the array
for i = 1:length(vector)
    if mod(vector(i),2) == 0 % Checking if number is even
        array = [array, vector(i)]; % Adding number to array
    end
end

% Printing the array of even numbers
disp("Array of even numbers:");
disp(array);
