% This code snippet is a complex function to calculate the mean and standard deviation
% of a given vector in MATLAB.

% Define input vector
input_vector = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

% Calculate mean of input vector
mean = sum(input_vector) / length(input_vector);

% Calculate squared differences from mean
squared_diff = (input_vector - mean).^2;

% Calculate sum of squared differences
sum_squared_diff = sum(squared_diff);

% Calculate standard deviation
std_dev = sqrt(sum_squared_diff / (length(input_vector) - 1));

% Print mean and standard deviation to console
disp(sprintf("Mean: %f \nStandard Deviation: %f", mean, std_dev));
