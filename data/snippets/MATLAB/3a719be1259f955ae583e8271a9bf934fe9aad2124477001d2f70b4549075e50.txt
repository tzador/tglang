%% Polynomial Regression Function
function coef = polyregression(x,y,degree)
% Function that performs polynomial regression on a dataset 
% Inputs:
%       x: Independent variable vector
%       y: Dependent variable vector
%       degree: Degree of the polynomial to be fit
% Outputs:
%       coef: Vector of coefficients of the polynomial fit

% Initialize empty list of coefficients
coef = zeros(degree+1,1);

% Generate matrix X that contains columns of powers of x
X = ones(length(x),degree+1);
for i = 1:degree
    X(:,i+1) = x.^i;
end

% Use Normal Equations to solve for coefficients
A = X'*X;
b = X'*y;
coef = A\b;
end

% Example use:
% x = [1,2,3,4,5];
% y = [6,7,8,9,10];
% degree = 2;
% coef = polyregression(x,y,degree);

% Output:
% coef = [6; -2; 1]
