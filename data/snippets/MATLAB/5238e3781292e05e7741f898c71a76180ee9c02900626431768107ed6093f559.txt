% Create a 3x3 matrix with random integer values between 1 and 10 
A = randi([1,10],3,3)

% Calculate the transpose of the matrix
B = A'

% Create a 3x3 identity matrix
C = eye(3)

% Multiply the transpose of the matrix and the identity matrix
D = B * C

% Find the maximum value in the resulting matrix
max_value = max(D(:))

% Round all values in the resulting matrix to the nearest integer
integer_matrix = round(D)

% Create a vector with values from -10 to 10
vector = -10:10;

% Square each element in the vector
squared_vector = vector .^ 2;

% Find all positive values in the vector
positive_values = squared_vector(squared_vector > 0)

% Create a logical vector with the same length as the original vector
logical_vector = logical(zeros(1,length(vector)))

% Set the values in the logical vector to 1 for all even numbers in the original vector
logical_vector(mod(vector,2) == 0) = 1

% Convert the logical vector to a numeric vector
numeric_vector = double(logical_vector)

% Add the numeric vector to the squared vector
combined_vector = squared_vector + numeric_vector

% Display the final vector in a plot
plot(combined_vector)
