A = rand(3,3); % Creates a 3x3 array with random values between 0 and 1
B = 5; % Assigns the value 5 to variable B
C = A + B; % Adds the constant 5 to every element in array A and stores the result in array C
C(:,2) = A(:,2) - B; % Subtracts the constant 5 from the second column of array A and stores the result in the second column of array C
D = C'*A; % Multiplies array C by the transpose of array A and stores the result in array D
E = sin(D) ./ cos(D); % Calculates the sine of each element in array D and divides it by the cosine of the same element, storing the result in array E
F = zeros(size(A)); % Creates a 3x3 array of zeros with the same size as array A
for i = 1:size(A,1) % Loops through each row of array A
    for j = 1:size(A,2) % Loops through each column of array A
        F(i,j) = A(i,j) + E(i,j)^2; % Adds the square of the corresponding element in array E to the element in the same position in array A and stores the result in array F
    end

disp(F) % Displays the final result, array F, in the command window
