%% Creating a Complex Matrix
%
% This code snippet creates a complex matrix using the |zeros| function and complex numbers.
% It uses a for loop to iterate through each element and assigns a random complex number to it.
%
% The complex number used is a linear combination of a real number and an imaginary number,
% where the real part is generated using the |rand| function and the imaginary part is generated using the |randn| function.
%
% The matrix size is specified by the user and stored in the variables |m| and |n|.
% The output is a complex matrix of size m-by-n.

% Define the matrix size
m = 4;
n = 6;

% Initialize the complex matrix with zeros
A = zeros(m,n);

% Loop through each element and assign a random complex number
for i = 1:m
    for j = 1:n
        % Generate a random real part using the rand function
        real_part = rand();
        % Generate a random imaginary part using the randn function
        imag_part = randn();
        % Create the complex number using the real and imaginary parts
        complex_num = real_part + 1i*imag_part;
        % Assign the complex number to the current element in the matrix
        A(i,j) = complex_num;
    end
end

% Display the resulting complex matrix
disp(A);
