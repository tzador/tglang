%% Defining variables
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]; %matrix with two rows and three columns
B = [7, 8; 9, 10; 11, 12]; %matrix with three rows and two columns
C = [13, 14, 15; 16, 17, 18]; %matrix with two rows and three columns
D = [19; 20; 21]; %matrix with three rows and one column

%% Matrix operations
E = A * B; %multiplication of matrices A and B
F = inv(C); %inversion of matrix C
G = A' + B'; %addition of the transpose of matrices A and B
H = A * D; %multiplication of matrices A and D
I = B * D; %multiplication of matrices B and D
J = A.^2; %element-wise squaring of matrix A

%% Conditionals and Loops
if E(2,1) == 36 %if statement checking if element at second row and first column of matrix E is equal to 36
    disp("Element at (2,1) is equal to 36."); %printing message if condition is true
else
    disp("Element at (2,1) is not equal to 36."); %printing message if condition is false
end

for i=1:length(D) %for loop iterating through elements of matrix D
    if mod(D(i),2) == 0 %checking if element is even
       disp("Element at index " + i + " is even."); %printing message if element is even
    end
end

%% Functions
function M = customFunction(x, y) %defining a function with two inputs and one output
    Z = sin(x) * cos(y); %performing calculations using inputs
    M = A + B + C + D + Z; %returning the result
end
