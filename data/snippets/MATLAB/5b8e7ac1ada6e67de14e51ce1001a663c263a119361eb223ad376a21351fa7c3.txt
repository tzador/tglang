% defining a matrix with random values
A = rand(3,3);

% transpose of matrix A
AT = A';

% calculating the determinant of matrix A
detA = det(A);

% creating a vector of even numbers
x = 2:2:10;

% concatenating vector and matrix A
newMatrix = [x' A];

% solving a system of linear equations
B = [1 2 3; 2 5 8; 3 8 14];
b = [3 6 14]';
