        %Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function
        %This function takes in input x and calculates the derivative of the function at that point
        %x can be a scalar or a vector of values at which the derivative needs to be calculated
        %t is the independent variable of the function

        %initialize y and grady vectors
        y = zeros(size(x));
        grady = zeros(size(x));

            %find h value (representing the change in x)

            %calculate the average of the two limits
            y(i) = (left + right)/2;

            %with respect to each input value
