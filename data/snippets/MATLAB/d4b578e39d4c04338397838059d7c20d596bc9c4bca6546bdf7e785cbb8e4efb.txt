% This is a code snippet in MATLAB
% It calculates the mean squared error between two matrices
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];
B = [9 8 7; 6 5 4; 3 2 1];
[m,n] = size(A); % get the size of the matrices
error = 0; % initialize error variable
for i = 1:m % iterate through rows
    for j = 1:n % iterate through columns
        diff = A(i,j) - B(i,j); % calculate difference between corresponding elements
        error = error + diff^2; % square difference and add to error
    end
end
mse = error / (m*n); % calculate mean squared error
disp(mse); % display result
