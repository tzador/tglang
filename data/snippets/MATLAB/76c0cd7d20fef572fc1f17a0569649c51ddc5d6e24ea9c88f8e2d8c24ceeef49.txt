% This code snippet generates a plot of the cantilever beam deflection as a function of length
% It takes in the length and breadth of the beam, as well as the modulus of elasticity and applied force
% and outputs a visualization of the deflection curve

% Define variables
L = 1; % length of beam in meters
b = 0.02; % breadth of beam in meters
E = 2e11; % modulus of elasticity in N/m^2
F = 100; % applied force in Newtons

% Create vector of beam lengths
x = linspace(0, L, 100); % 100 evenly spaced points between 0 and L

% Calculate deflection using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory
d = (F * L^3) / (3 * E * b^3) * (1 - (x / L).^2); % equation for deflection as a function of x

% Plot deflection curve
figure; % create new figure 
plot(x, d, 'b-', 'LineWidth', 2); % plot deflection curve in blue with line width of 2
xlabel('Beam Length (m)'); % label x-axis
ylabel('Deflection (m)'); % label y-axis
