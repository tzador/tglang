% This code performs matrix multiplication
% Generate two random matrices of size 100x100
A = rand(100);
B = rand(100);

% Create a new matrix to store the result of multiplication
C = zeros(100);

% Loop over rows and columns of matrices A and B
for i = 1:100
    for j = 1:100
        % Calculate the dot product of row i of A and column j of B
        dot_product = dot(A(i,:), B(:,j));
        
        % Store the result in the appropriate position of matrix C
        C(i,j) = dot_product;
    end
end

% Print the result
disp("The result of matrix multiplication is:");
disp(C);
