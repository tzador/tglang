%% Generate random data
x = rand(1,100);       % Creates an array of 100 random numbers between 0 and 1
y = randn(1,100);      % Creates an array of 100 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1

%% Plot data
figure;                % Creates a new figure window
scatter(x,y);          % Plots the data as individual points on a scatter plot
hold on;               % Holds the current plot so that additional plots can be added to it

%% Fit polynomial curve
p = polyfit(x,y,3);    % Fits a third degree polynomial to the data using least squares method
x_interp = linspace(min(x),max(x),100);   % Creates 100 evenly spaced points between the minimum and maximum values of x
y_interp = polyval(p,x_interp);           % Evaluates the polynomial at the interpolated points to create a smooth curve
plot(x_interp,y_interp);                   % Plots the smooth curve on the same figure as the scatter plot

%% Add titles and labels
title('Random Data and Fitted Curve');          % Adds a title to the plot
xlabel('X');                                    % Adds a label to the x-axis
ylabel('Y');                                    % Adds a label to the y-axis
legend('Data','Fitted Curve','Location','Northwest');   % Adds a legend to the plot in the northwest corner

%% Save figure as PNG
saveas(gcf,'random_data_plot.png');   % Saves the figure as a PNG file in the current directory
