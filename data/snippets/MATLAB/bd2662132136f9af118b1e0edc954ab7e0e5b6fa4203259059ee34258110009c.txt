% This is a code snippet in MATLAB.
% It creates a 10x10 matrix with random integers from 1 to 100.
% It then finds the indices of elements that are greater than 50.
% Finally, it replaces those elements with their negative values.

matrix = randi([1,100], 10, 10); % Creates a 10x10 matrix with random integers from 1 to 100
[row, col] = find(matrix > 50); % Finds the indices of elements greater than 50
matrix(row, col) = -1 * matrix(row, col); % Replaces those elements with their negative values

disp(matrix); % Outputs the modified matrix
