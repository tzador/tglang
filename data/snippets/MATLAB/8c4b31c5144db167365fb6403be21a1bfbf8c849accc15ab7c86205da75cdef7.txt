% This code snippet creates a function that calculates the given number's factorial

function factorial = calculate_factorial(number)

if number < 0                        % checks if number is negative
    error('Number must be non-negative integer');
elseif number == 0                   % checks if number is equal to zero
    factorial = 1;
else
    factorial = 1;
    
    for i = 1:number                 % loops from 1 to given number
        factorial = factorial * i;   % calculates factorial by multiplying current value with current factorial
    end
end
