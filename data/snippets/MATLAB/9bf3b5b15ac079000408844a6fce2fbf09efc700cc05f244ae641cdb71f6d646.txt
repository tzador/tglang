%% Matrix multiplication and vector subtraction
% This code snippet shows how to multiply two matrices and subtract a vector
% from the resulting matrix in MATLAB.

% Define two matrices A and B
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9];
B = [9, 8, 7; 6, 5, 4; 3, 2, 1];

% Define a vector C
C = [10, 11, 12];

% Multiply A and B using matrix multiplication
D = A * B;

% Subtract vector C from matrix D
E = D - C;

% Display the result
disp(E);
