% Define a matrix A with 5 rows and 4 columns
A = [1, 3, 5, 7; 2, 4, 6, 8; 9, 11, 13, 15; 10, 12, 14, 16; 17, 19, 21, 23];

% Calculate the determinant of A
detA = det(A);

% Print out the determinant of A in a formatted string with two decimal places
fprintf('The determinant of A is %.2f', detA);

% Create a new vector x with same number of elements as the number of columns in A
x = linspace(1, 10, 4);

% Use a for loop to multiply each row of A by corresponding element in x
for i = 1:size(A,1)
    A(i,:) = A(i,:) * x(i);
end

% Display the updated matrix A
disp(A);
