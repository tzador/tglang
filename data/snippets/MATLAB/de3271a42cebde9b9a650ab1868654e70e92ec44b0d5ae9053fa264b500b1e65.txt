%%%This code snippet generates a random 10x10 matrix and performs a singular value decomposition (SVD) on it.
%The SVD is a matrix factorization technique used for dimensionality reduction and data compression.
%It decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, S, and V.
%U and V are unitary matrices and S is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values.
%To perform the SVD, we first generate a random matrix using the rand function in MATLAB.
A = rand(10); %generate a 10x10 matrix with values between 0 and 1
%Next, we use the svd function to compute the singular value decomposition of A.
[U, S, V] = svd(A); %returns U, S, and V matrices
%To reconstruct the original matrix A, we can use the formula: A = U*S*V'
A_reconstructed = U*S*V'; %reconstructed 10x10 matrix
