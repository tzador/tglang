% This is a comment in the code that explains what the following line of code does
x = [1 2 3]; % This creates a 1x3 vector with values 1, 2, and 3
% This is another comment explaining the next line of code
y = x + 5; % This adds 5 to each element in the vector x and stores the result in vector y
% This is a conditional statement that checks if the first element in vector y is larger than 5
if y(1) > 5 
    % This is a for loop that iterates through the elements in vector y and prints their square
    for i = 1:length(y)
        disp(y(i)^2) % This prints the square of the current element in the vector
    end
elseif y(1) == 5 % This is an alternative conditional statement if the first element is exactly 5
    disp("The first element in vector y is equal to 5.") % This prints a message to the user
else % This is the final conditional statement, in case none of the above conditions are met
    disp("The first element in vector y is smaller than 5.") % This prints another message to the user
end
% This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given input number
function fact = factorial(n) 
    % This is a recursive function, calling itself until the base case is reached
    if n == 1 
        fact = 1; % This sets the initial factorial value to 1
    else
        fact = n * factorial(n-1); % This calculates the factorial by multiplying with the previous number
    end
end
% This is a loop that iterates through vector x and prints the factorial of each element
for i = 1:length(x)
    curr_factorial = factorial(x(i)); % This calls the factorial function and stores the result in a variable
    disp(curr_factorial) % This prints the result to the user
