%% Compute the Euclidean distance between two points in a 3-dimensional space

% Define the coordinates of the two points
point1 = [3, 5, 1]; 
point2 = [7, 2, -4];

% Compute the square of the differences between the coordinates of each point
dx = (point1(1) - point2(1))^2;
dy = (point1(2) - point2(2))^2;
dz = (point1(3) - point2(3))^2;

% Sum the squared differences
sum_squared_diff = dx + dy + dz;

% Take the square root to get the Euclidean distance
euclidean_dist = sqrt(sum_squared_diff); 

% Print the result to the console
disp("The Euclidean distance between point1 and point 2 is: " + euclidean_dist);
