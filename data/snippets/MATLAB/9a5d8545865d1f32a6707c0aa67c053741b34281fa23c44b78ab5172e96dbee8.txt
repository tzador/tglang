% This code performs a DFT on a given signal
% Inputs:
%        x - input signal
% Output:
%        X - DFT of the input signal

N = length(x); %calculate length of input signal
k = 0:N-1; %create a vector k with values from 0 to N-1
n = 0:N-1; %create a vector n with values from 0 to N-1
WN = exp((-2*pi*1i)/N); %calculate the exponential term in DFT equation
nk = n'*k; %create a matrix with values of n multiplied by k
WNnk = WN .^ nk; %calculate the DFT matrix by raising WN to the power of nk
X = x * WNnk; %multiply the input signal with the DFT matrix to get the DFT of the signal
