% This code snippet calculates the distance between two points
% given their coordinates in 3D space.

% Initialize variables for the coordinates of the first point
x1 = 5; y1 = 3; z1 = 2;

% Initialize variables for the coordinates of the second point
x2 = 8; y2 = 1; z2 = 6;

% Calculate the distance between the two points using the distance formula
distance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2);

% Display the calculated distance
fprintf("The distance between the two points is %f units.", distance);
