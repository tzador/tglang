% Program to calculate the average of an array

% Initialize array
A = [2, 5, 7, 9, 3, 1, 10];

% Get the number of elements in the array
n = length(A);

% Initialize sum variable
sum = 0;

% Use a for loop to iterate through the array and calculate the sum
for i = 1:n
    % Add the element at index i to the sum variable
    sum = sum + A(i);
end

% Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements
avg = sum / n;

% Print the average to the console
fprintf("Average: %f", avg);
