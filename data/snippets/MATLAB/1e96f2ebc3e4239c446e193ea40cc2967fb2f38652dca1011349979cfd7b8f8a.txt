% This code snippet creates a function that calculates the derivative of
% a given function using the central difference method

function derivative = central_difference(function, x, h) % declare the function and its input variables
    % INPUT:
    %   function - the function to calculate the derivative of
    %   x - the point to calculate the derivative at
    %   h - the step size for central difference method
    
    % OUTPUT:
    %   derivative - the calculated derivative of the function at point x
    
    derivative = (function(x + h) - function(x - h)) / (2*h); % calculate the derivative using central difference method formula
end

% Sample usage:
% given a function f(x) = x^2, calculate its derivative at x = 3 with step size 0.01
f = @(x) x^2; % define the function
derivative = central_difference(f, 3, 0.01); % calculate the derivative using the central difference function
disp(derivative); % display the calculated derivative, output should be 6.01
