%% Create a matrix using random values
mat = rand(4, 5);

%% Calculate the mean of each column
col_means = mean(mat, 1);

%% Create a vector of ones with the same length as the number of columns in the matrix
ones_vec = ones(1, size(mat, 2));

%% Subtract the mean of each column from the vector
diff_vec = ones_vec - col_means;

%% Multiply the matrix with the difference vector 
final_mat = mat .* diff_vec;

%% Display the final matrix
final_mat
