%% Create a random matrix of size m x n
m = 5; % assign value 5 to m
n = 10; % assign value 10 to n
A = rand(m,n); % generate a matrix of random values of size m x n

%% Calculate the arithmetic mean of each column
mean_col = mean(A); % calculate mean of each column and save as a row vector

%% Calculate the standard deviation of each row
% First, calculate the mean of each row
mean_row = mean(A,2); % calculate mean of each row and save as a column vector
% Then, subtract the mean from each element in a row
A_centered = A - mean_row; % subtract mean from each element in A
% Finally, calculate the standard deviation using the centered data
std_row = std(A_centered,0,2); % calculate standard deviation of each row and save as a column vector

%% Plot the standard deviation for each row
figure; % create new figure
plot(1:m, std_row); % plot the standard deviation for each row
xlabel('Row'); % label x-axis as 'Row'
ylabel('Standard Deviation'); % label y-axis as 'Standard Deviation'
