% This is a complex MATLAB code snippet that performs matrix multiplication and vector addition

% Generate a random 4x4 matrix
A = rand(4);

% Generate a random 4x1 vector
b = rand(4, 1);

% Perform matrix multiplication between A and A transposed
C = A * A';

% Add vector b to the result of the matrix multiplication
D = C + b;

% Perform element-wise multiplication between C and D
E = C .* D;

% Take the mean of each column in E and store it in a vector
means = mean(E, 1);

% Create a figure and plot the means vector as a bar graph
figure;
bar(means);

% Add a title and labels for the axes
title('Mean Values of Element-wise Multiplication');
xlabel('Column Number');
ylabel('Mean Value');
