%This code snippet generates a 100-by-100 matrix with random
%numbers between 0 and 1, and then applies the transformation matrix
%with scaling factor of 2 to the generated matrix

%Initialize the matrix with random values
matrix = rand(100,100);

%Create transformation matrix with scaling factor of 2
transformation = [2 0;
                  0 2];

%Apply transformation matrix to the original matrix
transformed_matrix = transformation * matrix;

%Print the transformed matrix
disp(transformed_matrix);
