% This is a MATLAB code snippet that generates a complex matrix using nested for loops
% It creates a 5x5 matrix with random complex numbers
A = zeros(5,5); % initialize matrix with zeros
for i = 1:5 % first for loop iterates through rows
    for j = 1:5 % second for loop iterates through columns
        A(i,j) = randi([1 10]) + 1i*randi([1 10]); %assigns random complex number to each element
    end
end
disp(A); % display the final matrix
