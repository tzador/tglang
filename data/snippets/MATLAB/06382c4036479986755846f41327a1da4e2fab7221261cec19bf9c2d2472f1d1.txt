function [x,y,z] = splitVector(vec)
% This function takes a vector as input and splits it into three separate vectors for x, y, and z coordinates
% Input:
    % vec - a 1xN vector that contains the x, y, and z coordinates, where N is a multiple of 3
% Output:
    % x - a 1x(N/3) vector that contains the x coordinates
    % y - a 1x(N/3) vector that contains the y coordinates
    % z - a 1x(N/3) vector that contains the z coordinates
x = vec(1:3:end); % extract every third element starting from the first element to create x vector
y = vec(2:3:end); % extract every third element starting from the second element to create y vector
z = vec(3:3:end); % extract every third element starting from the third element to create z vector
