% This code snippet performs a multivariate linear regression using the least squares method
% Input data must be in the form of a matrix, with each column representing a different variable
% and the final column being the dependent variable.
% X matrix must have a column of ones for the intercept term
% Output is a vector of coefficients corresponding to each variable in the X matrix

function [coeff] = linearRegression(X,y)
% Initialize variables
[n,m] = size(X);
coeff = zeros(m,1);

% Calculate inverse of X'X
XtX = X'*X;
XtX_inv = inv(XtX);

% Calculate X'y
Xty = X'*y;

% Calculate coefficients
coeff = XtX_inv * Xty;
end

% To use the function:
% Make X matrix and y vector from your data, then call the function:
% coeff = linearRegression(X,y)
% The output vector, coeff, will contain the coefficients for each variable in the X matrix.
