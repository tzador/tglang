% Create a 3D matrix of size 5x5x5
A = randi(10,5,5,5);

% Find the sum of each row and store it in a new column vector
row_sums = sum(A,2);

% Reshape the 3D matrix into a 2D matrix of size 25x5
B = reshape(A,25,5);

% Create a new column vector with values corresponding to the index of each row
index = (1:25)';

% Append the new column vector to the right of the 2D matrix
C = [B,index];

% Sort the matrix by the second column in descending order
sorted_matrix = sortrows(C,-2);

% Extract the first 5 rows of the sorted matrix
first_five = sorted_matrix(1:5,:);

% Calculate the mean of each column in the first five rows
means = mean(first_five(:,1:end-1));

% Multiply each element in the first column with a scalar value of 2
first_column = first_five(:,1)*2;

% Replace the second column with a vector of ones
first_five(:,2) = ones(5,1);
