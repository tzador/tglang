%% Initialize variables and matrices
x = linspace(0, 10, 100); %create a vector with 100 evenly spaced points from 0 to 10
y = ones(1, 100); %create a vector of ones with 100 elements
z = zeros(100, 100); %create a 100x100 matrix of zeros
A = rand(100, 100); %create a 100x100 matrix of random numbers between 0 and 1

%% Loop through matrices and perform calculations
for i = 1:100 %loop through rows of matrices
    for j = 1:100 %loop through columns of matrices
        y(i) = y(i) * x(j) + A(i, j); %perform calculation for each element of y vector
        z(i, j) = exp(A(i, j)) / (1 + cos(x(j))); %perform calculation for each element of z matrix
