%This code snippet demonstrates the use of a nested for loop to generate a matrix with specified dimensions
%First, we define the dimensions of the matrix
rows = 5; %number of rows in the matrix
cols = 8; %number of columns in the matrix

%Next, we create an empty matrix with the specified dimensions
matrix = zeros(rows,cols);

%Now, we use a nested for loop to fill in the values of the matrix
for i=1:rows %loop through each row
  for j=1:cols %loop through each column in the current row
    matrix(i,j) = i*j; %multiply the row number by the column number to generate the value for that position in the matrix
  end
end

%Finally, we print out the generated matrix
disp("The generated matrix is:")
disp(matrix)
