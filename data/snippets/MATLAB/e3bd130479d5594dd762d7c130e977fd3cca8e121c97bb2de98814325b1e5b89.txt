x = logspace(-10,10,100); % generates a logarithmically spaced vector with 100 points from 10^-10 to 10^10
A = rand(100); % generates random 100x100 matrix
b = A*x'; % multiplies the matrix A with the vector x, transpose of x is taken for proper dimensions
% solving the system of linear equations using backslash operator
x_calc = A\b; % calculates the solutions to the system of equations using Gaussian elimination and back substitution
residual = norm(A*x_calc' - b); % calculates the norm of the residual, i.e. the difference between A*x and b
fprintf("The residual of the calculated solution is %f", residual); % prints the calculated residual to the console
