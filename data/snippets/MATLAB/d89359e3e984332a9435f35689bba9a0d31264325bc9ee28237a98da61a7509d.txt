% This code snippet illustrates the implementation of a recursive function
% that calculates the factorial of a given number
function [factorial] = factorial_recursive(number)
    % Base case: If the number is 0, return 1
    if number == 0
        factorial = 1;
    % Recursive case: Call the function again with number-1 and multiply
    % the result with the number
    else
        factorial = number * factorial_recursive(number-1);
    end
end
