% This code snippet calculates the steady state concentration of a reactant in a batch reactor
% with a reversible reaction
% Author: John Smith

% Define initial conditions
C0 = 10; % Initial concentration of reactant (mol/L)
k1 = 0.2; % Forward reaction rate constant (L/mol/min)
k2 = 0.5; % Backward reaction rate constant (L/mol/min)

% Define differential equations
dCdt = @(C) -k1*C + k2*C^2; % Differential equation for C

% Solve for steady state concentration
options = optimset('Display','off'); % Define options for fsolve function
C_ss = fsolve(dCdt,C0,options); % Use fsolve function to solve for steady state concentration

% Display results
fprintf('The steady state concentration is %0.4f mol/L. \n',C_ss); % Display steady state concentration with 4 decimal places
