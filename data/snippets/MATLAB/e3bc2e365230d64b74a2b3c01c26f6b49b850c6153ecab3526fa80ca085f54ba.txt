% This code snippet sets up a matrix multiplication
clc; % clear command window
A = [1,2;3,4]; % define matrix A
B = [5,6;7,8]; % define matrix B
C = zeros(2,2); % initialize matrix C with zeroes
for i = 1:2 % loop through rows of matrix A
    for j = 1:2 % loop through columns of matrix B
        for k = 1:2 % loop through columns of matrix A/rows of matrix B
            C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k) * B(k,j); % perform matrix multiplication and store result in C
        end
    end
end
disp(C); % print result
