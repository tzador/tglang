function [A, B] = matrixMultiplication(X, Y)
% this function multiplies two matrices and returns the result
% input: X and Y are matrices of size mxn and nxp respectively
% output: A is the multiplied matrix of size mxp
%         B is the mono-time dominant term of the algorithm 
[m, n] = size(X); % get the size of matrix X
[~, p] = size(Y); % get the size of matrix Y
A = zeros(m, p); % initialize matrix A with zeros
% loop through each row of X 
for i = 1:m 
    % loop through each column of Y
    for j = 1:p 
        % loop through each element of X and Y
        for k = 1:n 
            A(i, j) = A(i, j) + X(i, k) * Y(k, j);
        end 
    end 
end 
B = m * p * n; % calculate the mono-time dominant term of the algorithm
