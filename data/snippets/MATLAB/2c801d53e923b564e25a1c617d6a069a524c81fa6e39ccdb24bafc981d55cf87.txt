%% Generate a random matrix
n = 10; % initialize size of matrix
A = randn(n); % creates a n by n matrix with random values from a normal distribution
%% Perform matrix multiplication
A_transpose = A'; % transpose the matrix A
A_squared = A * A_transpose; % multiply the original matrix A by its transpose to get A squared
%% Plot matrix
subplot(1,3,1); % creates a figure with 1 row, 3 columns, and plots in the first position
imagesc(A); % plots the matrix as an image
colormap(gray); % sets the color map to grayscale
title('A matrix'); % add title to plot
subplot(1,3,2); % plot in second position
imagesc(A_transpose); % plot the transposed matrix as an image
colormap(gray); % set color map
title('A transpose matrix'); % add title
subplot(1,3,3); % plot in third position
imagesc(A_squared); % plot A squared as an image
colormap(gray); % set color map
title('A multiplied by A transpose'); % add title
colorbar; % add colorbar legend to plot
