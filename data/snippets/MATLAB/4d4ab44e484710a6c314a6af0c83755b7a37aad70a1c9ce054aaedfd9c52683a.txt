%% This code snippet is a function that implements the forward substitution method for solving a lower triangular linear system

% The function takes in two arguments, a lower triangular matrix L and a
% column vector b

function x = forwardSubstitution(L, b)

% Determine the dimensions of the input matrix L
[n, n] = size(L);

% Initialize the solution vector
x = zeros(n, 1);

% Set the first element of the solution vector to the first element of the b vector divided by the first element of the first row of L
x(1) = b(1)/L(1,1);

% Loop through the remaining rows
for i = 2:n
    % Initialize the sum term
    sum = 0;
    
    % Loop through the columns up to the current row
    for j = 1:i-1
        % Accumulate the sum term by subtracting the appropriate
        % product of L and x from b
        sum = sum + L(i,j)*x(j);
    end
    
    % Calculate the solution element using the sum term and the
    % appropriate element from the b vector
    x(i) = (b(i) - sum)/L(i,i);
end
