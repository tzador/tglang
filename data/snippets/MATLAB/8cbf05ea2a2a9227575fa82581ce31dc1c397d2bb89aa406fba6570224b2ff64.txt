function [d1,d2] = correlation(x,y)
% This function calculates the normalized cross-correlation between two vectors 
% x and y and returns the two correlation values d1 and d2
% d1 is calculated using the traditional cross-correlation formula
% d2 is calculated using the normalized cross-correlation formula
% x and y must be the same length
% Inputs:
%   x - first vector
%   y - second vector
% Outputs:
%   d1 - traditional cross-correlation value
%   d2 - normalized cross-correlation value

% Calculate the length of the vectors
N = length(x);

% Calculate the mean of the two vectors
mean_x = mean(x);
mean_y = mean(y);

% Calculate the difference between each element of the vectors and its mean
x_avgdiff = x - mean_x;
y_avgdiff = y - mean_y;

% Calculate the numerator of the traditional cross-correlation formula
num_d1 = sum(x_avgdiff .* y_avgdiff);

% Calculate the denominator of the traditional cross-correlation formula
den_d1 = sqrt(sum(x_avgdiff .^ 2) * sum(y_avgdiff .^ 2));

% Calculate d1 using the traditional formula
d1 = num_d1 / den_d1;

% Calculate the numerator and denominator of the normalized cross-correlation formula
num_d2 = x_avgdiff * y_avgdiff';
den_d2 = sqrt((x_avgdiff * x_avgdiff') * (y_avgdiff * y_avgdiff'));

% Calculate d2 using the normalized formula
d2 = num_d2 / den_d2;
