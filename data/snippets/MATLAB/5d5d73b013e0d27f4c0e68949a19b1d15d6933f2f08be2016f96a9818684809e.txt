%% DESCRIPTION:
% This function calculates the root mean square error (RMSE) of a given
% input signal and its corresponding prediction signal. The RMSE is a
% metric commonly used in evaluating the performance of regression models.

%% FUNCTION:
function [rmse] = calculate_RMSE(input_signal, prediction_signal)

% INPUTS:
% input_signal - the actual signal values
% prediction_signal - the predicted signal values

% OUTPUTS:
% rmse - the computed root mean square error

% CALCULATION:
% 1. Calculate the squared differences between the actual and predicted
% signal values.
squared_diff = (input_signal - prediction_signal).^2;

% 2. Calculate the mean of the squared differences.
mean_squared_diff = mean(squared_diff);

% 3. Calculate the square root of the mean squared difference to get the
% root mean square error (RMSE).
rmse = sqrt(mean_squared_diff);
