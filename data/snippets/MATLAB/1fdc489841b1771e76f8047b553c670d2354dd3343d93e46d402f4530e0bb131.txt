%% Polynomial Interpolation
% This code snippet will perform polynomial interpolation on a given set of points.
% It will take in the x and y coordinates of the points and output the coefficients of the interpolated polynomial.

% Define the points to be interpolated
x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
y = [2, 4, 6, 8];

% Calculate the Vandermonde matrix
A = zeros(length(x), length(x));
for i = 1:length(x)
    A(:,i) = x.^(i-1);
end

% Solve the linear system for the coefficients
coeffs = A\y.';

% Define the symbolic variable x
syms x;

% Construct the interpolated polynomial
p = 0;
for i = 1:length(coeffs)
    p = p + coeffs(i)*x^(i-1);
end

% Plot the original points and interpolated polynomial
plot(x,y,'o');
hold on;
fplot(p);
legend('Data Points','Interpolated Polynomial');

% Display the coefficients of the interpolated polynomial
disp("The coefficients of the interpolated polynomial are:");
disp(coeffs);
