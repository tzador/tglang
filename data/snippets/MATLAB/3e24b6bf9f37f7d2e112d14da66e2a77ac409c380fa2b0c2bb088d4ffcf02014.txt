% define variables
x = 0:0.1:10;  % create a vector from 0 to 10 with a step size of 0.1
y = sin(x);     % compute sine of each element in x
z = cos(x);     % compute cosine of each element in x
a = 5;          % assign the value 5 to variable a

% create a figure
figure;         % create a new figure window
hold on;        % hold all plot elements on the same axes
plot(x, y);     % plot the vector x against y
plot(x, z);     % plot the vector x against z
xlabel('x');    % set label for x-axis
ylabel('y/z');  % set label for y-axis
legend('sin', 'cos');    % add legend for the plots
title('Sine and Cosine Functions');    % add title for the plot

% perform calculations
b = a^2 - 3;        % calculate b by squaring a and subtracting 3
c = a^3 + b^2;      % calculate c by cubing a and adding the square of b
d = c / (a*b);      % calculate d by dividing c by the product of a and b
e = sqrt(d) + 2;    % calculate e by taking the square root of d and adding 2
