%% Solving Systems of Linear Equations %%
% This code snippet shows how to solve a system of linear equations using MATLAB.
% First, define the coefficient matrix A and the constant vector b.
A = [3, -1, 2; 2, 6, -4; 1, 5, -7];
b = [4; 9; -2];
% Next, use the backslash operator to solve the system of equations.
x = A \ b;
% The solution vector x contains the solutions to the system of equations.
% To verify the solution, compute A*x and compare to b.
check = A*x == b;
% Check the solution for each equation using the element-wise logical operator.
if all(check)
    fprintf("The solution is correct.\n");
else
    fprintf("The solution is incorrect.\n");
end
% Finally, display the solution vector x.
fprintf("The solution vector is:\n");
disp(x);
