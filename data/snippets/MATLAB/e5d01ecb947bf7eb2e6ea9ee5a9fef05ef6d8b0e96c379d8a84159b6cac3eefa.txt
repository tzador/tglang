% This code snippet performs matrix multiplication of two 3x3 matrices
% and stores the result in a third matrix of the same size
% Define the first matrix with values 1 to 9 in a column-wise format
A = [1,4,7;2,5,8;3,6,9];
% Define the second matrix with values 1 to 9 in a row-wise format
B = [1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9];
% Initialize the third matrix to store the result, all elements are 0
C = zeros(3,3);
% Use nested for loops to iterate through each row and column of the matrices
for i = 1:3 % loop through rows of A
    for j = 1:3 % loop through columns of B
        for k = 1:3 % loop through columns of A and rows of B
            % Multiply the corresponding elements and add to the result
            C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k)*B(k,j);
        end
    end
end
% Print the result matrix C
