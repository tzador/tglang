% Creating a matrix of ones of size 5x5
A = ones(5,5)
% Creating a vector of random integers
B = randi([1,100],1,10)
% Multiply the matrix A with the vector B
C = A * B
% Find the maximum value in C and its index
[d, index] = max(C(:))
% Reshape B into a 5x5 matrix
B = reshape(B, 5,5)
% Replace all elements in B greater than 50 with 0
B(B > 3) = 0
