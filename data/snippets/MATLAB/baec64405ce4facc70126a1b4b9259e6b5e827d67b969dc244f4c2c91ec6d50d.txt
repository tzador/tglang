%This code is used to calculate the trajectory of a projectile motion in MATLAB
%Given initial velocity (v0), angle of projection (theta), and acceleration due to gravity (g)
%Initial position of the projectile is assumed to be (0,0)

%Declaring variables
v0 = input('Enter the initial velocity (in m/s): '); %Takes input from user for initial velocity
theta = input('Enter the angle of projection (in degrees): '); %Takes input from user for angle of projection
g = 9.8; %Acceleration due to gravity

%Converting angle from degrees to radians
theta = theta*(pi/180); %Uses conversion formula to convert degrees to radians

%Calculating initial velocity components
vx0 = v0*cos(theta); %Calculates initial velocity in x-direction
vy0 = v0*sin(theta); %Calculates initial velocity in y-direction

%Defining time interval and number of time steps
deltaT = 0.01; %Time interval (in seconds)
numSteps = 100; %Number of time steps

%Initializing arrays for position and velocity
sx = zeros(1,numSteps); %Array for x-position of projectile
sy = zeros(1,numSteps); %Array for y-position of projectile
vx = zeros(1,numSteps); %Array for x-velocity of projectile
vy = zeros(1,numSteps); %Array for y-velocity of projectile

%Calculating position and velocity at each time step
for i=1:numSteps
    %Calculating x-position and velocity
    sx(i) = vx0*i*deltaT; %Uses kinematic equation for x-position
    vx(i) = vx0; %x-velocity remains constant
    
    %Calculating y-position and velocity
    sy(i) = vy0*i*deltaT - 0.5*g*i^2; %Uses kinematic equation for y-position
    vy(i) = vy0 - g*i; %Uses kinematic equation for y-velocity
end

%Plotting the trajectory
