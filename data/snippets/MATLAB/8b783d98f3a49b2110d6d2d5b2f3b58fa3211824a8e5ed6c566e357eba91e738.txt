%% Multivariate Normal Distribution Generator
N = 100; % number of samples
M = 3; % number of variables
mu = [5 10 -3]; % mean for each variable
Sigma = [3 2 1; 2 4 0; 1 0 5]; % covariance matrix
X = mvnrnd(mu,Sigma,N); % generate N samples from a multivariate normal distribution with mean mu and covariance matrix Sigma
% X is a N-by-M matrix, where each row represents a sample
plot3(X(:,1),X(:,2),X(:,3), 'o'); % plot the samples in 3D space

% Compute the sample mean and covariance matrix
Xmean = mean(X); % sample mean
Xvar = sum((X-Xmean).^2)/(N-1); % sample variance
Xcov = (X-Xmean)'*(X-Xmean)/(N-1); % sample covariance matrix
