% This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms
% Initialize variables
n = input('Enter the number of terms:'); % number of terms
fib = zeros(n,1); % preallocate vector to store sequence
fib(1) = 1; % initialize first term
fib(2) = 1; % initialize second term
% Calculate Fibonacci sequence
for i = 3:n % loop through remaining terms
    fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2); % calculate next term by adding previous two terms
end
% Print sequence
fprintf('The first %d terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:\n',n);
fprintf('%d ',fib); % print sequence separated by spaces
fprintf('\n'); % print new line
