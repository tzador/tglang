% This code snippet uses a for loop to generate a 5 by 5 magic square matrix
n = 5; % set the size of the magic square
magic_square = zeros(n); % initialize a matrix of size n by n with all elements set to 0
row = n; % set the starting point for the first row
col = (n+1)/2; % set the starting point for the first column
magic_square(row, col) = 1; % set the first element in the top middle of the matrix as 1

for i = 2:n^2 
    % loop through all the remaining elements
    prev_row = row; % store the previous row value
    prev_col = col; % store the previous column value
    row = row - 1; % move up one row
    col = col + 1; % move right one column
    
    % check if the new row and column values are out of bounds
    % if they are, wrap around to the opposite side of the matrix
    if(row < 1) 
        row = n;
    end
    if(col > n)
        col = 1;
    end
    
    % check if the current position is already filled
    % if it is, move down one row and left one column from the previous position
    if(magic_square(row, col) ~= 0)
        row = prev_row + 1;
        col = prev_col - 1;
    end
    
    % set the current element as the next consecutive number
    magic_square(row, col) = i;
end

% print the resulting magic square matrix
disp(magic_square);
