% This is a code snippet that generates a 3-dimensional matrix
% of random integers with dimensions 4x3x5

% Define the dimensions of the matrix
rows = 4;
cols = 3;
depth = 5;

% Initialize the matrix with zeros
matrix = zeros(rows, cols, depth);

% Loop through each element in the matrix
for i = 1:rows
    for j = 1:cols
        for k = 1:depth
            % Generate a random integer between 1 and 10
            random_int = randi([1, 10]);

            % Assign the random integer to the current element
            matrix(i, j, k) = random_int;
        end
    end
end

% Print the matrix to the console
disp(matrix)
