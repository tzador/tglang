% This code snippet uses a for loop to calculate the sum of first n even numbers.

% Initialize variables
n = 10; % change this value to compute the sum of first n even numbers
sum = 0; % initialize sum variable

% Use a for loop to compute the sum
for i = 2:2:n 
    sum = sum + i; % add i to the sum
end

% Output the sum
disp("The sum of the first " + n + " even numbers is: " + sum);

% Sample output:
% The sum of the first 10 even numbers is: 110
