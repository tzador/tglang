% This code snippet creates a function that calculates the sum of two matrices
function [result] = matrix_sum(matrix1, matrix2)
% The inputs are two matrices, matrix1 and matrix2
% The function checks if the matrices are of the same size
if size(matrix1) == size(matrix2)
    % If they are of the same size, the matrices are added together element-wise
    result = matrix1 + matrix2;
else
    % If they are not of the same size, an error is thrown
    error('Matrices must be of the same size.');
end
% The resulting matrix is returned as the output of the function
end
