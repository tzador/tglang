%% Function to compute Euclidean distance between two points
% This function takes in two points as input
% x1 and y1 represent the coordinates of the first point
% x2 and y2 represent the coordinates of the second point
% The output is the Euclidean distance between the two points
function dist = computeDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    % Compute the difference between x coordinates
    xDiff = x2 - x1;
    
    % Compute the difference between y coordinates
    yDiff = y2 - y1;
    
    % Square the differences and add them
    dist = xDiff^2 +yDiff^2;
    
    % Take the square root to get the Euclidean distance
    dist = sqrt(dist);
