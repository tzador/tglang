%This code snippet uses a for loop to calculate the sum of squares for a given vector of numbers

%define a vector of numbers
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

%initialize variable to store the sum of squares
sum = 0;

%iterate through the elements of the vector using a for loop
for i = 1:length(numbers)
  
  %calculate the square of the current element and add it to the sum
  sum = sum + numbers(i)^2;
  
end

%print the final sum of squares
disp("The sum of squares for the given vector is:");
disp(sum);
