% Define a matrix A with 3 rows and 4 columns
A = [1,2,3,4;5,6,7,8;9,10,11,12]

% Find the average of each column
avg_cols = mean(A)

% Create a vector with values ranging from 1 to 10
vec = 1:10

% Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10
for i=1:10
    disp(i)
end

% Create a new matrix B with random integer values from 1 to 100
B = randi([1,100], 3, 4)

% Find the largest element in each row of matrix B
max_rows = max(B,[],2)

% Calculate the sum of all elements in matrix B 
sum_B = sum(sum(B))

% Find the determinant of matrix B
det_B = det(B)

% Create a cell array with strings and numbers
cell = {'hello', 2.5, 'world', 7}

% Use a while loop to print 'hello' until counter reaches 5
counter = 1
while counter <= 5
    disp('hello')
    counter = counter + 1;
