%% Define Constants
k = 5; % value of constant k
n = 10; % value of constant n
x0 = [1;2;3;4;5]; % initial condition as a column vector

%% Generate A Matrix
A = randn(n,n); % generate a random n by n matrix
A = (A + A'); % make A symmetric by adding its transpose
for i=1:n % loop through all rows of A
    A(i,i) = sum(abs(A(i,:))); % set diagonal values as the sum of absolute values of the row
end

%% Generate B Matrix
B = zeros(n,k); % initialize B as a zero matrix with n rows and k columns
for i=1:n % loop through all rows of B
    for j=1:k % loop through all columns of B
        B(i,j) = i^(j-1); % set values of B based on power of i+1
    end
end

%% Perform Operations
xk = x0; % set initial condition as xk
for i=1:n % loop through all values until n
    xk = A*xk + B(:,i); % perform matrix multiplication and add corresponding column of B
    disp(xk); % display xk at each iteration
end
