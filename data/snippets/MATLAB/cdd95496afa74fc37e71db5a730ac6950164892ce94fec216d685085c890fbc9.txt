%Initialize variables
x = linspace(0, 10, 100);  %Create a vector of 100 evenly spaced points from 0 to 10
y = sin(x);  %Calculate the sine of each value in x and store the result in a vector y

%Plot the results
figure;  %Create a new figure window
plot(x, y, 'color', 'blue', 'LineWidth', 2);  %Plot the points from x and y, set the line color to blue, and increase the line width to 2
hold on;  %Hold the current plot so future plots are added to it
plot(x, cos(x), 'color', 'red', 'LineWidth', 2);  %Plot the points from x and the cosine of x, set the line color to red, and increase the line width to 2
title('Plot of Sine and Cosine Functions');  %Add a title to the plot
xlabel('x');  %Label the x-axis
ylabel('y');  %Label the y-axis
legend('Sine Function', 'Cosine Function');  %Add a legend to the plot showing which line corresponds to which function

%Calculate the area under the curve
area_under_sin = trapz(x, y);  %Use the trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under the curve of the sine function
area_under_cos = trapz(x, cos(x));  %Use the trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under the curve of the cosine function

%Print the results
fprintf('The area under the sine curve is %f \n', area_under_sin);  %Print the result of the area under the sine curve in decimal format
fprintf('The area under the cosine curve is %f \n', area_under_cos);  %Print the result of the area under the cosine curve in decimal format
