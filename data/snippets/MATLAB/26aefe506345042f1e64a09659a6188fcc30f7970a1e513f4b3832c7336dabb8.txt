% Create a matrix with values from -5 to 5 in increments of 0.5
matrix = (-5:0.5:5);

% Calculate the mean of each column in the matrix
mean_col = mean(matrix);

% Calculate the standard deviation of each row in the matrix
std_row = std(matrix,0,2);

% Calculate the sum of all elements in the matrix
sum_elements = sum(matrix(:));

% Reshape the matrix into a 5x4 matrix
reshaped_matrix = reshape(matrix,5,4);

% Generate a random 3x3 matrix with values between 0 and 1
random_matrix = rand(3);

% Calculate the inverse of the random matrix
inverse = inv(random_matrix);

% Find the maximum value in the matrix and its index
[max_value, max_index] = max(matrix(:));

% Create a cell array with three different data types: string, number, and matrix
cell_array = {'Hello', 2.5, [-1 0; 4 5]};

% Plot a sine wave with a period of 2 and amplitude of 3

% Add a title, axis labels, and a grid to the plot
title('Sine Wave Plot');
