% This code snippet sorts a list of numbers in descending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
% The input is a vector of numbers called "unsorted_list".
% The output is a vector of numbers called "sorted_list".

%initialize a boolean variable to keep track of whether or not a swap has been made
swap = true;

%initialize a counter for the number of passes through the list
passes = 0;

%while there have been swaps made in the previous pass or this is the first pass
while swap
    %reset the value of swap to false for the next pass
    swap = false;
    
    %increment the counter for the number of passes
    passes = passes + 1;
    
    %iterate through the list, starting at the first element
    for i = 1:length(unsorted_list)-1
        %if the current element is less than the next element
        if unsorted_list(i) < unsorted_list(i+1)
            %swap the two elements
            temp = unsorted_list(i);
            unsorted_list(i) = unsorted_list(i+1);
            unsorted_list(i+1) = temp;
            
            %set swap to true to indicate that a swap has been made in this pass
            swap = true;
        end
    end
end

%print out the sorted list
sorted_list = unsorted_list;
disp(sorted_list);
