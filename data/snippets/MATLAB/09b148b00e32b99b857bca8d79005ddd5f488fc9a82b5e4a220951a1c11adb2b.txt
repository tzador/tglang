%% Initialize Variables %%
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9];
B = [10, 11, 12; 13, 14, 15; 16, 17, 18];
C = zeros(3,3);
D = ones(3,3);

%% Perform Matrix Operations %%
C = A + B'; % Perform matrix addition and perform transpose on B
D = A * B; % Perform matrix multiplication
E = diag(A); % Extract diagonal elements of A
F = det(A); % Calculate determinant of A
G = A' * B; % Perform matrix multiplication between transpose of A and B

%% Plot Results %%
subplot(2,2,1), imagesc(A), colorbar; % Plot heatmap of matrix A
subplot(2,2,2), imagesc(B), colorbar; % Plot heatmap of matrix B
subplot(2,2,3), imagesc(C), colorbar; % Plot heatmap of matrix C after addition and transposition
subplot(2,2,4), imagesc(D), colorbar; % Plot heatmap of matrix D after multiplication
