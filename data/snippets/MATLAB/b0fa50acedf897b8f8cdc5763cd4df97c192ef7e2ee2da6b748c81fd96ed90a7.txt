%% Define variables
x = linspace(0,10,100); % Creates a vector with 100 evenly spaced points between 0 and 10
y = sin(x); % Calculates sine of each element in x vector
z = zeros(1,100); % Creates a vector of zeros with 100 elements
n = numel(x); % Calculates the number of elements in vector x
m = 5; % Sets a value for m

%% For loop
for i = 1:n % Loops through each element in x vector
    if rem(x(i),m) == 0 % Checks if x(i) is evenly divisible by m
        z(i) = y(i); % Assigns the value of y(i) to z(i)
    else
        z(i) = 0; % Assigns 0 to z(i)
    end
end

%% Plot graph
figure % Opens a new figure window
plot(x,y,'r') % Plots the original sine curve in red
hold on % Keeps plot on figure for next command
plot(x,z,'b--') % Plots the modified curve with evenly spaced points in blue dashed line
xlabel('x') % Labels x-axis as x
ylabel('y') % Labels y-axis as y
title('Modified Sine Curve') % Sets title of graph
legend('Original','Modified') % Adds legend to graph
