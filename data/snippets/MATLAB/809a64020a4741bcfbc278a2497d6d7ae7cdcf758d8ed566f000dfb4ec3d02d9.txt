% Generate a random matrix of size N x M
N = 5; % Number of rows
M = 10; % Number of columns

% Initialize an empty matrix
A = [];

% Generate random numbers and append to the matrix
for i = 1:N
    for j = 1:M
        A(i,j) = rand();
    end
end

% Print the matrix
disp(A);

% Calculate the sum of each column using vectorized operations
column_sum = sum(A); % column_sum is a 1 x M vector

% Calculate the mean of each column using vectorized operations
column_mean = mean(A); % column_mean is a 1 x M vector

% Calculate the sum of each row using vectorized operations
row_sum = sum(A, 2); % row_sum is a N x 1 vector

% Calculate the mean of each row using vectorized operations
row_mean = mean(A, 2); % row_mean is a N x 1 vector
