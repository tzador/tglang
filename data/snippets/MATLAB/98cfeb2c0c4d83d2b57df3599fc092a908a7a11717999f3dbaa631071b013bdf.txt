%% Vector Transformation Function
% This function takes in a vector and performs a series of transformations,
% including scaling, rotation, and translation.
% The inputs are the initial vector (v), scaling factor (s), rotation angle (theta), 
% and translation amounts for x and y (tx, ty).
% The output is the transformed vector (v_t) in the form of [x;y] coordinates.

function v_t = transform(v, s, theta, tx, ty)

% Scaling transformation
S = [s 0; 0 s];

% Rotation transformation
R = [cos(theta) -sin(theta); sin(theta) cos(theta)];

% Translation transformation
T = [1 0 tx; 0 1 ty];

% Combine transformations
M = T * R * S;

% Apply transformation to vector
v_t = M * v;
end

% Example input and output:
% v = [1;2]  s = 2  theta = pi/4  tx = 3  ty = -1
% v_t = [2.6716;4.1213]
