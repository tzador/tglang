function [x_mean, x_std] = calculate_stats(x)
% This function calculates the mean and standard deviation of a given
% vector x and returns them in x_mean and x_std respectively.
%-----
% INPUT:
% x - vector of numerical values
% -----
% OUTPUT:
% x_mean - mean of vector x
% x_std - standard deviation of vector x

% Calculate the mean of x
x_mean = sum(x) / length(x);

% Calculate the sum of squared differences from the mean
diffs = (x - x_mean).^2;
sum_diffs = sum(diffs);

% Calculate the standard deviation using the formula with n-1
x_std = sqrt(sum_diffs ./ (length(x) - 1));
