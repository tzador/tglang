% This code snippet is a complex vector multiplication using the FFT algorithm
% Define input vectors x and y with 1000 elements each
x = rand(1,1000);
y = rand(1,1000);

% Calculate the FFT of the input vectors
X = fft(x);
Y = fft(y);

% Calculate the product of X and Y using element-wise multiplication
XY = X .* Y;

% Perform inverse FFT to get the final result
xy = ifft(XY);
