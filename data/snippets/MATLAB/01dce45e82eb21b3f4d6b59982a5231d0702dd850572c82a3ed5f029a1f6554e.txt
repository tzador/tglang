% This code snippet solves the differential equation: dy/dx = -2xy
% The output of the code snippet is a plot of the solution y(x)

% Define initial conditions and x range
y0 = 1; % Initial value of y
xspan = [0 10]; % Range of x values for the plot

% Define the function for the derivative dy/dx
fun = @(x,y) -2*x*y;

% Solve the differential equation using the built-in solver function
[x,y] = ode45(fun,xspan,y0);

% Plot the solution
plot(x,y)
xlabel('x');
ylabel('y(x)');
