% Generate random matrix A
A = randi([1,10],5,5); % 5x5 matrix with random integers from 1 to 10
% Create identity matrix of size 5x5
I = eye(5);
% Compute inverse of A using LU factorization
[L,U] = lu(A); % LU factorization of A
inv_A = U\L; % Solve linear system U * inv_A = L^-1
% Multiply A and inv_A
result = A * inv_A; % should give identity matrix I
