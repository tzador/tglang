%% Function to calculate the root mean square error between two vectors
% x and y are vectors of equal length
% Output: rmse, the root mean square error between x and y
function rmse = calculateRMSE(x,y)
    % Initialize variables
    n = length(x); % length of vector x
    diff_squared = zeros(n,1); % vector to store squared differences
    
    % Calculate squared difference between each element of x and y
    for i=1:n
        diff_squared(i) = (x(i)-y(i))^2;
    end
    
    % Calculate mean of squared differences
    mean_diff_squared = mean(diff_squared);
    
    % Calculate root mean square error
    rmse = sqrt(mean_diff_squared);
