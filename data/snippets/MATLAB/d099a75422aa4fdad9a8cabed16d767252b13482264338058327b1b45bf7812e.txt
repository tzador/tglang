% This is a complex code snippet in MATLAB

% First, we define a function with inputs `x` and `y`
function [z] = myFunc(x,y)

% Next, we create a matrix `A` with size based on inputs `x` and `y`
A = rand(x,y);

% Then, we use a for loop to iterate through each row of `A`
for i = 1:x
    
    % Within the for loop, we use another for loop to iterate through each column of `A`
    for j = 1:y
        
        % We calculate the sum of the current element of `A` with the element above it and store it in `temp`
        temp = A(i,j) + A(i-1,j);
        
        % If `temp` is less than 10, we multiply the current element by 2 and store it back in `A`
        if temp < 10
            A(i,j) = A(i,j) * 2;
            
        % Otherwise, we divide the current element by 2 and store it back in `A`
        else
            A(i,j) = A(i,j) / 2;
        end
        
    end
    
end

% Finally, we calculate the sum of all elements in `A` and store it in `z`
z = sum(sum(A));

% We also display the resulting matrix `A`
disp(A);
