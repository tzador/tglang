% This is a comment in MATLAB indicating the start of a code snippet.

% Define a function with two input variables and one output variable
function [output] = complexCalculation(x,y)

% Create a matrix with random values
matrix = rand(x,y);

% Sort the values in the matrix from smallest to largest
sorted_matrix = sort(matrix(:));

% Calculate the mean of the sorted matrix
mean_value = mean(sorted_matrix);

% Create a vector with values from 1 to x
vector = 1:x;

% Initialize a variable for the sum of squared values
sum_squared = 0;

% Loop through the vector
for i=1:length(vector)
    % Square each value in the vector
    squared_value = vector(i)^2;
    
    % Add the squared value to the sum
    sum_squared = sum_squared + squared_value;
end

% Calculate the final output value using all previously defined variables
output = (mean_value * sum_squared) / (x + y);
