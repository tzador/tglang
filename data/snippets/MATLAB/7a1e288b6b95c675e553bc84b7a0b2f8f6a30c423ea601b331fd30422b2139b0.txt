%% This is a MATLAB code snippet for solving a system of linear equations using matrix inversion and application of Cramer's Rule

% Define the coefficients of the system of equations
coefficients = [4 -7 6; 2 -3 4; -5 9 -12];

% Define the constants of the system
constants = [-27; 22; -15];

% Calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix
determinant = det(coefficients);

% Check if the system has a unique solution (if determinant is not equal to 0)
if determinant ~= 0
   % Initialize the solution vector
   solutions = zeros(3,1);
   
   % Loop through each column of the coefficient matrix
   for i = 1:3
      % Create a copy of the coefficient matrix
      temp_matrix = coefficients;
      
      % Replace the given column with the constants vector
      temp_matrix(:,i) = constants;
      
      % Calculate the determinant of the temporary matrix
      temp_determinant = det(temp_matrix);
      
      % Calculate the solution for the current variable
      solutions(i) = temp_determinant/determinant;
   end
   
   % Display the solutions to the system of equations
   fprintf('The solutions to the system of equations are: \n');
   disp(solutions);
else
   % If determinant is 0, then the system has no unique solution
   fprintf('There is no unique solution to the system of equations.');
