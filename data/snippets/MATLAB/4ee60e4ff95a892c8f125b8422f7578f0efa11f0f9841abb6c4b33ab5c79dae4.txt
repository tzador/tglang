% Declare a variable, a, of type double and assign it a value of 5
a = 5;

% Declare a variable, b, of type char and assign it a value of 'hello'
b = 'hello';

% Create a 3x3 matrix, A, with random values between 0 and 1
A = rand(3);

% Create a vector, x, with 10 evenly spaced values between 1 and 50
x = linspace(1, 50, 10);

% Use a for loop to iterate through the vector, x, and print out each value
for i = 1:length(x)
    disp(x(i));
end

% Define a function that takes in two parameters and returns their sum
function sum = addNumbers(num1, num2)
    sum = num1 + num2;
end

% Call the addNumbers function and store the result in a variable, c
c = addNumbers(3, 7);

% Create a plot with the vector, x, as the x-axis and the sine of x as the y-axis
plot(x, sin(x));

% Add a title, labels, and legend to the plot
title('Sine Function');
xlabel('x-values');
ylabel('sin(x)');
legend('sin(x)');
