%% Time-frequency analysis using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
% This code snippet performs the STFT on a signal and plots the time-frequency representation.

%% Signal and window parameters
Fs = 1000;          % sampling frequency
t = 0:1/Fs:5;       % time vector
f0 = 50;            % fundamental frequency of signal
x = sin(2*pi*f0*t); % signal, single-tone sinusoid
winLength = 0.3;    % window length in seconds
overlap = 0.5;      % window overlap in percentage (50%)

%% STFT calculation
winSamples = winLength*Fs;               % converting window length to samples
win = hamming(winSamples);               % creating hamming window
stepSize = round((1-overlap)*winSamples); % calculating step size based on window overlap
nfft = 2^nextpow2(winSamples);           % determining size of FFT
[S, F, T] = spectrogram(x, win, stepSize, nfft, Fs); % calculating STFT
