% This code snippet performs singular value decomposition on a given matrix
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]; % create a 3x3 matrix 
[U, S, V] = svd(A); % perform SVD on matrix A and store results in matrices U, S, and V 
S_diag = diag(S); % extract diagonal elements of matrix S 
[U_sort, I] = sort(U, 'descend'); % sort matrix U in descending order and store indices in matrix I 
V_sort = V(:, I); % sort matrix V based on indices in matrix I 
S_sort = diag(S_diag(I)); % sort matrix S_diag based on indices in matrix I and convert back into diagonal matrix 
A_recon = U_sort * S_sort * V_sort'; % reconstruct original matrix A from sorted matrices 
disp(A_recon); % print reconstructed matrix
