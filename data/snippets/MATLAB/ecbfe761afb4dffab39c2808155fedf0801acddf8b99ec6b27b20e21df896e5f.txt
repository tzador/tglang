% Define a matrix with values from 1 to 5 
matrix = [1 2 3 4 5];

% Reshape the matrix into a 3 by 2 matrix 
reshaped_matrix = reshape(matrix, [3, 2]);

% Calculate the sum of each row in the reshaped matrix 
row_sum = sum(reshaped_matrix, 2);

% Create a vector with values from 1 to 3 
vector = [1 2 3];

% Use meshgrid to create two 2-Dimensional arrays 
[X, Y] = meshgrid(vector, vector);

% Multiply the two arrays element-wise 
multiplied = X .* Y;

% Transpose the multiplied array 
transposed = transpose(multiplied);

% Create a 4x4 identity matrix 
identity = eye(4);

% Calculate the element-wise product of the identity matrix and the transposed array 
product = identity .* transposed;

% Calculate the dot product of the matrix and the transposed array 
dot_product = dot(matrix, transposed);

% Display the sum of each row, the multiplied array, and the dot product 
disp(row_sum);
disp(multiplied);
disp(dot_product);
