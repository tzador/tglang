%% Code snippet for curve fitting in MATLAB %%
%First, initialize the variables for x and y data%
x = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
y = [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81];

%Next, use the polyfit function to fit a degree 2 polynomial curve to the data%
coeff = polyfit(x,y,2);

%Then, use the polyval function to evaluate the polynomial at each x value%
y_fit = polyval(coeff,x);

%Now, plot the original data points and the fitted curve on a graph%
figure
plot(x,y,'o',x,y_fit);

%Add labels and a title to the graph%
xlabel('x');
ylabel('y');
title('Curve Fitting with a Degree 2 Polynomial');

%Finally, calculate the root mean square error between the original data and fitted curve%
rmse = sqrt(sum((y-y_fit).^2)/length(x));
