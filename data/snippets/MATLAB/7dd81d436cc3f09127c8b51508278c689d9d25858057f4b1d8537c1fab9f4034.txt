%% Generate dataset
dataset = zeros(1000, 10); % Create a 1000 by 10 matrix of zeros
for i = 1:1000 % Loop through every row
    for j = 1:10 % Loop through every column
        dataset(i,j) = randn; % Assign a random value to each element
    end
end

%% Calculate mean for each row
mean_row = mean(dataset, 2); % Calculate the mean for each row
% Output: 1x1000 vector containing the mean for each row in dataset

%% Calculate standard deviation for each column
std_col = std(dataset); % Calculate the standard deviation for each column
% Output: 1x10 vector containing the standard deviation for each column in dataset

%% Remove outliers based on 3 standard deviations from mean
for j = 1:10 % Loop through every column
    col_mean = mean(dataset(:,j)); % Calculate mean for current column
    col_std = std(dataset(:,j)); % Calculate standard deviation for current column
    lower_bound = col_mean - 3*col_std; % Calculate lower bound for outlier removal
    upper_bound = col_mean + 3*col_std; % Calculate upper bound for outlier removal
    
    % Remove values outside of bounds from dataset
    dataset(:,j) = dataset(:,j)(dataset(:,j) >= lower_bound & dataset(:,j) <= upper_bound);
end

% Output: Original dataset with outliers removed from each column
