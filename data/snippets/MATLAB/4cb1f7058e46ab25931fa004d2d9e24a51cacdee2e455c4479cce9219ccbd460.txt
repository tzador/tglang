%% Create a Matrix with Random Complex Numbers
% This code generates a 5x5 matrix with random complex numbers using the
% |rand| function in MATLAB.

% Define the dimensions of the matrix as variables
rows = 5; % number of rows
cols = 5; % number of columns

% Create an empty matrix of the specified dimensions
matrix = zeros(rows, cols);

% Loop through each element of the matrix and generate a random complex number
for i = 1:rows
    for j = 1:cols
        % Use the |rand| function to generate a random real number
        % between 0 and 1
        real_num = rand();
        
        % Use the |rand| function again to generate a random imaginary number
        % between 0 and 1
        imag_num = rand();
        
        % Combine the real and imaginary numbers into a complex number
        complex_num = complex(real_num, imag_num);
        
        % Set the current element of the matrix to the generated complex number
        matrix(i, j) = complex_num;
    end
end
