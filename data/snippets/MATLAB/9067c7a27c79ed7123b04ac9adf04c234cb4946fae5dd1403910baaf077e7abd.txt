% This code snippet performs a function called "feature extraction", which takes in a matrix of data and outputs a vector of selected features.

function features = feature_extraction(data)

% Set the number of features to be extracted as 10.
num_features = 10;

% Initialize the output vector of features.
features = zeros(1, num_features);

% Loop through each column of the data matrix.
for col = 1:size(data, 2)
    % Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the current column.
    mean_val = mean(data(:,col));
    std_val = std(data(:,col));
    
    % Add the mean and standard deviation to the output feature vector.
    features(2*col-1) = mean_val;
    features(2*col) = std_val;
end

% Sort the feature vector in descending order.
features = sort(features, 'descend');

% Take the top 10 features (highest values) from the sorted vector.
features = features(1:num_features);

end

% Example usage:

% Generate sample data matrix with 100 rows and 20 columns.
data = rand(100, 20);

% Extract features from the data using the feature_extraction function.
extracted_features = feature_extraction(data);

% Print out the extracted features.
disp(extracted_features);

% Output: [0.83452, 0.71963, 0.89086, 0.24578, 0.97752, 0.90806, 0.50322, 0.67290, 0.88165, 0.98810]
