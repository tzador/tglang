% This code snippet calculates the dot product of two vectors using MATLAB built-in functions

% Creating two random vectors
a = rand(1,5);
b = rand(1,5);

% Calculating the dot product using dot() function
dot_product = dot(a,b);

% Displaying the dot product
disp("The dot product of vectors a and b is:");
disp(dot_product);
