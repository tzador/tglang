%% Generate Fibonacci sequence
% This code generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit.
% It takes in user input for the limit and then uses a for loop to iterate through the sequence.
% At each iteration, the code checks if the current number is within the given limit
% and if so, adds it to an array to store the sequence.
% Finally, the code displays the generated sequence.

% Prompt user for the limit of the sequence
limit = input('Enter the limit for the Fibonacci sequence: ');

% Initialize an empty array to store the sequence
sequence = [];

% Iterate through the sequence up to the given limit
for i = 1:limit
    % Check if the current number is within the limit
    if i <= 2
        % Add first two numbers (0 and 1) to the sequence
        sequence = [sequence i-1];
    else
        % For numbers greater than 2, add the sum of the previous two numbers
        sequence = [sequence sequence(i-1)+sequence(i-2)];
    end
end

% Display the generated sequence
fprintf('The Fibonacci sequence up to %d is: ', limit);
disp(sequence);
