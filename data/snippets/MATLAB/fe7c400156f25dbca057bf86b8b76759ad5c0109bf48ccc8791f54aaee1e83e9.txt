% This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms
% Initializing the first two terms of the sequence
fib(1) = 0;
fib(2) = 1;
% Specifying the number of terms to generate as a variable
num_terms = 10;
% Loop to calculate and store the remaining terms
for i = 3:num_terms
    fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2);
end
% Displaying the generated sequence
disp("The Fibonacci sequence up to " + num_terms + " terms is:");
% Print the sequence in a readable format
fprintf("%d, ",fib(1:num_terms));
fprintf("\n");
