% This code snippet creates a matrix of random numbers and performs vector operations on it

% Create a 5x5 matrix with random elements
A = rand(5);

% Create a 5x1 vector with random elements
vec = rand(5,1);

% Transpose the vector to be a 1x5 vector
vec = vec';

% Multiply the matrix and vector to get a new vector
new_vec = A * vec;

% Perform element-wise multiplication between the new vector and the original vector
final_vec = new_vec .* vec;

% Square each element in the final vector
final_vec = final_vec .^ 2;

% Find the sum of the elements in the final vector
sum_final = sum(final_vec);

% Display the result
sum_final
