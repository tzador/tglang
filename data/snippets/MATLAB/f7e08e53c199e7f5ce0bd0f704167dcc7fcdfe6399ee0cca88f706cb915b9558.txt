% Create a random matrix of size 10 x 10
A = rand(10);
% Define a new variable B as a copy of matrix A
B = A;
% Iterate through the rows of matrix B and replace all negative values with 0
for i = 1:size(B,1)
    B(i,B(i,:)<0) = 0;
end
% Calculate the dot product of matrix A and B
C = A*B;
% Print the result
disp(C);
