% Creates a matrix of random integers with dimensions 3 by 3
A = randi(10,[3,3]); 
% Creates a vector of random numbers with length 5
B = rand(1,5); 
% Calculates the determinant of matrix A
detA = det(A); 
% Transposes matrix A and multiplies by vector B
C = A.' * B; 
% Rounds the elements of vector B to the nearest whole number
B = round(B); 
% Create a vector of ones with length equal to the number of rows in matrix A
D = ones(1,size(A,1)); 
% Divides vector B by vector D element-wise
E = B./D; 
% Finds the minimum value in vector B and returns its index
[min_val, min_idx] = min(B); 
% Prints the determinant of matrix A and the minimum value in vector B
fprintf('The determinant of A is %d\n', detA);
