%% Calculate the dot product of two vectors
% Initialize the first vector
vector1 = [3, 4, -2];

% Initialize the second vector
vector2 = [-1, 5, 8];

% Calculate the length of the vectors
length_vector1 = norm(vector1);
length_vector2 = norm(vector2);

% Calculate the dot product
dot_product = dot(vector1, vector2);

% Print the results
disp("Length of vector 1: " + length_vector1);
disp("Length of vector 2: " + length_vector2);
disp("Dot product of vector 1 and vector 2: " + dot_product);
