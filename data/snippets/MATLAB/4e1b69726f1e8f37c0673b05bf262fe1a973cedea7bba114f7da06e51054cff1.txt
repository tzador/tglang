%% Statistical Analysis of COVID-19 Data

% Import data from CSV file
covid_data = readmatrix('covid_data.csv');

% Remove rows with missing values
covid_data = rmmissing(covid_data);

% Calculate mean, median, and mode of confirmed cases
mean_cases = mean(covid_data(:,2));
median_cases = median(covid_data(:,2));
mode_cases = mode(covid_data(:,2));

% Calculate standard deviation and variance of deaths
std_deaths = std(covid_data(:,3));
var_deaths = var(covid_data(:,3));

% Perform t-test to compare confirmed cases in different regions
north_cases = covid_data(covid_data(:,4) == 1, 2); % Northern region
south_cases = covid_data(covid_data(:,4) == 2, 2); % Southern region
[h,p,ci,stats] = ttest2(north_cases, south_cases); % Two-sample t-test

% Create scatter plot of confirmed cases and deaths
scatter(covid_data(:,2), covid_data(:,3));
xlabel('Confirmed Cases');
ylabel('Deaths');
title('COVID-19 Cases and Deaths');

% Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between confirmed cases and deaths
corr_coeff = corrcoef(covid_data(:,2), covid_data(:,3));
