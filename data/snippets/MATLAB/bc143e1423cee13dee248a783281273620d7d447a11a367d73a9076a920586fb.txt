% This code generates a series of Fibonacci numbers and prints the sum of every third number in the series.

% Define number of terms in series
n = 10;

% Initialize array to hold Fibonacci numbers
fib_array = zeros(1, n);

% Set first two values in array
fib_array(1) = 1;
fib_array(2) = 1;

% Loop through remaining values in array
for i = 3:n
    % Calculate next Fibonacci number
    fib_array(i) = fib_array(i-1) + fib_array(i-2);
end

% Initialize sum variable
sum = 0;

% Loop through every third number in array and add to sum
for i = 3:3:n
    sum = sum + fib_array(i);
end

% Print sum of every third number in series
disp("The sum of every third number in the Fibonacci series is: " + sum);
