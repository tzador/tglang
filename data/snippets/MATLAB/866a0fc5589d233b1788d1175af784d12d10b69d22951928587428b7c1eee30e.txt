% Initialize variables
a = 10;             % Declare integer variable a with value 10
b = a^2;            % Set b equal to a squared
c = -5;             % Declare integer variable c with value of -5

% Loop through values of c
for i = 1:c         % Create for loop with index variable i starting at 1 and ending at c
    if i == 0       % Check if i is equal to 0

fprintf('The value of b is %d\n', b); % Print the value of b
