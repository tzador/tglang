% Defining an array of numbers
numbers = [2, 5, 8, 11, 13, 16];

% Creating a new array to store the squared values
squared_numbers = zeros(size(numbers));

% Using a for loop to iterate through the numbers array
for i = 1:length(numbers)
    
    % Squaring the current number and assigning it to the squared_numbers array
    squared_numbers(i) = numbers(i)^2;
end

% Displaying the squared_numbers array in the command window
disp(squared_numbers);
