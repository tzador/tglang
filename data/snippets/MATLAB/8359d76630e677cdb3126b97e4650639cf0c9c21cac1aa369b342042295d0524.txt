% This code snippet generates a random matrix with specified dimensions and stores it in a variable
% named 'A'

% Define the dimensions of the matrix
rows = 5;  % number of rows
cols = 7;  % number of columns

% Initialize the matrix
A = zeros(rows, cols);

% Loop through the rows
for i = 1:rows
    % Loop through the columns
    for j = 1:cols
        % Generate a random number between 0 and 100 and store it in the current element of matrix A
        A(i, j) = randi(100);
    end
end

% Print the generated matrix
disp(A);
