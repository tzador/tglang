% Create a matrix of random integers
matrix = randi(100,[5,5]);

% Find the maximum value in each column
max_vals = max(matrix,[],1);

% Find the minimum value in each row
min_vals = min(matrix,[],2);

% Calculate the mean of all values
mean_val = mean(matrix(:));

% Add a constant to every element in the matrix
added_matrix = matrix + 5;

% Replace all odd numbers with zero
added_matrix(rem(added_matrix,2)~=0) = 0;

% Convert the matrix to a vector
vector = matrix(:);

% Reshape the vector into a 3x5 matrix
reshaped_matrix = reshape(vector,[3,5]);

% Remove the second row
reshaped_matrix(2,:) = [];

% Create a new matrix with double the values of the original
double_matrix = matrix * 2;

% Add the two matrices together
added_matrices = double_matrix + matrix;
