%% Initialize variables
N = 100; % assign a value of 100 to N
x = linspace(0, 10, N); % create a vector of equally spaced numbers from 0 to 10
y = sin(x); % calculate the sine value of each element in x and assign it to y
z = cosd(x); % calculate the cosine value in degrees of each element in x and assign it to z

%% Plot the results
figure; % create a new figure window
plot(x, y, 'b--'); % plot y against x using a dashed blue line
hold on; % hold the current plot for further additions
plot(x, z, 'r-'); % plot z against x using a solid red line
title('Trigonometric Functions'); % add a title to the plot
xlabel('Angle (radians)'); % label the x-axis as angle in radians
ylabel('Value'); % label the y-axis as value
legend('Sin(x)', 'Cos(x)'); % add a legend to the plot
hold off; % release the current plot
