% This code snippet generates a graph of the Lorenz attractor using MATLAB's ode45 function
% defining the ODEs and initial conditions
sigma = 10; % defining the sigma constant
beta = 8/3; % defining the beta constant
rho = 28; % defining the rho constant
equations = @(t, X) [sigma*(X(2) - X(1)); X(1)*(rho - X(3)); X(1)*X(2) - beta*X(3)]; % defining the ODEs as a function of time t and vector X
initial_conditions = [1; 1; 1]; % defining the initial conditions as a column vector
tspan = [0, 50]; % defining the time span 
% solving the ODE using the ode45 function
[T, Y] = ode45(equations, tspan, initial_conditions); % storing the time and solution vectors in T and Y respectively
% plotting the solution
figure; % creating a new figure
plot3(Y(:,1), Y(:,2), Y(:,3)); % plotting the solution vectors in 3D
title('Lorenz Attractor'); % adding a title to the graph
xlabel('X'); ylabel('Y'); zlabel('Z'); % labeling the axes
grid on; % adding grid lines to the graph
