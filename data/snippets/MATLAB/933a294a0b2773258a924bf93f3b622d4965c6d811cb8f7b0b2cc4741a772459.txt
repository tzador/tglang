% This code snippet creates a function to calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
% using a recursive method.

function [fib] = fibonacci(n)
    % Initializing first two terms of the sequence
    fib(1) = 0;
    fib(2) = 1;

    if n == 1 % Base case for nth term equals 1
        fib = 0;
    elseif n == 2 % Base case for nth term equals 2
        fib = 1;
    else % Recursive case for when nth term is greater than 2
        % Calling the function recursively to find the (n-1)th term and (n-2)th term
        fib(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
    end
