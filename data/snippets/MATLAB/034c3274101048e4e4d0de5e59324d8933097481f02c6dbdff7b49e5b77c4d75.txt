%% Pre-processing
% This section of the code is used to perform pre-processing on the data before it is used for analysis.

% Load data from file
data = load('data.csv');

% Remove any missing values
data = rmmissing(data);

% Normalize data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1
data = zscore(data);

% Create a matrix of the features
X = data(:,1:end-1);

% Create a vector of the labels
y = data(:,end);

% Add a column of ones to the feature matrix for the intercept term
X = [ones(size(X,1), 1), X];

%% Feature Selection
% This section of the code is used to select the most relevant features for analysis.

% Create a matrix of the correlation coefficients between features and labels
correlations = corrcoef(X, y);

% Set a correlation threshold for feature selection
threshold = 0.3;

% Find features with a correlation above the threshold
feature_indices = find(abs(correlations(end,1:end-1)) > threshold);

% Select only the relevant features from the feature matrix
X_selected = X(:,feature_indices);

%% Linear Regression
% This section of the code is used to perform linear regression on the selected features.

% Initialize the regression weights to all zeros
w = zeros(size(X_selected,2),1);

% Set the maximum number of iterations for gradient descent
max_iters = 1000;

% Set the learning rate for gradient descent
learning_rate = 0.01;

% Perform gradient descent to find the optimal regression weights
for iter = 1:max_iters
    % Calculate the predictions based on current regression weights
    predictions = X_selected * w;
    
    % Calculate the error between predictions and actual labels
    error = predictions - y;
    
    % Update the regression weights using gradient descent
    w = w - (learning_rate * X_selected' * error); 
end

%% Prediction
% This section of the code is used to make predictions on new data using the trained regression model.

% Load new data from file
new_data = load('new_data.csv');

% Remove any missing values
new_data = rmmissing(new_data);

% Normalize new data using the mean and standard deviation of the training data
norm_data = (new_data - mean(data)) / std(data);

% Add a column of ones for the intercept term
norm_data = [ones(size(norm_data,1),1), norm_data];

% Only select the relevant features
new_data_selected = norm_data(:,feature_indices);

% Make predictions on the new data using trained weights
predictions = new_data_selected * w;

% Print the predictions
disp(predictions);
