% This code snippet generates 1000 random numbers and calculates their standard deviation
rng(1); % sets the seed for the random number generator
random_numbers = randn(1000, 1); % generates a 1000x1 matrix of random numbers from a standard normal distribution
mean = sum(random_numbers) / length(random_numbers); % calculates the mean of the random numbers
variance = sum((random_numbers - mean).^2) / (length(random_numbers) - 1); % calculates the sample variance of the random numbers
standard_deviation = sqrt(variance); % calculates the sample standard deviation
disp("The standard deviation of the generated random numbers is: "); % displays a message
disp(standard_deviation); % displays the calculated standard deviation
