% This code snippet calculates the weight and balance of an aircraft
% Given inputs are the weights of the pilot, passenger, luggage and fuel
% all in kilograms.

% declare variables
pilot_weight = input('Enter pilot weight in kilograms: ');
passenger_weight = input('Enter passenger weight in kilograms: ');
luggage_weight = input('Enter luggage weight in kilograms: ');
fuel_weight = input('Enter fuel weight in kilograms: ');

% calculate total weight
total_weight = pilot_weight + passenger_weight + luggage_weight + fuel_weight;

% calculate center of gravity (CG)
% assume distances from reference point are: pilot = 0.4m, passenger = 2.5m,
% luggage = 2m, fuel = 1.5m
pilot_distance = 0.4;
passenger_distance = 2.5;
luggage_distance = 2;
fuel_distance = 1.5;
total_distances = [pilot_distance, passenger_distance, luggage_distance, fuel_distance];
distances_from_cg = total_distances - min(total_distances); % calculate distances from CG (reference point has minimum distance)
moments = distances_from_cg .* [pilot_weight, passenger_weight, luggage_weight, fuel_weight];
total_moment = sum(moments);
cg = total_moment / total_weight; % calculate CG location in meters from reference point

% display results
fprintf('\nTotal weight: %.2f kg \nCenter of gravity: %.2f m from reference point \n', total_weight, cg);

% check if CG falls within safe limits (between 22% to 30% of mean aerodynamic chord)
safe_lower_limit = 0.22 * 20; % assuming mean aerodynamic chord = 20m
safe_upper_limit = 0.30 * 20;
if cg < safe_lower_limit || cg > safe_upper_limit
    disp('WARNING: CG is not within safe limits!');
