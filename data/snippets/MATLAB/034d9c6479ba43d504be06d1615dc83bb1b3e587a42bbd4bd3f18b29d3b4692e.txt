% This code snippet performs a matrix multiply of two randomly generated matrices

% Generate a random 3x4 matrix with values between 0 and 1
A = rand(3,4);

% Generate a random 4x5 matrix with values between 0 and 1
B = rand(4,5);

% Perform matrix multiplication using the built-in function 'mtimes'
C = mtimes(A, B);

% Display the result in the command window
disp('The result of multiplying A and B is:');
disp(C);
