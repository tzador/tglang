% Create a random 5x5 matrix with values between 1 and 10
A = randi([1,10], 5, 5);

% Find the sum of all elements in the matrix
total = sum(A(:));

% Create a 5x5 identity matrix
I = eye(5);

% Multiply the two matrices and store the result in a new 5x5 matrix
B = A*I;

% Create a new matrix with elements that are 5 times greater than A
C = A.*5;

% Find the maximum value in the matrix
max_val = max(max(A));

% Create a new vector with values ranging from -10 to 10
vec = -10:10;

% Create a cell array with strings and numerical values
cell_array = {'Hello', 5, 'World', 10};

% Access the third element in the cell array
third = cell_array{3};

% Create a structure with fields for student names and their corresponding grades
grades = struct('Student1', 85, 'Student2', 92, 'Student3', 78);

% Access the grade of 'Student2'
student2_grade = grades.Student2;
