% This code snippet creates a function that calculates the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence
% The function takes in a positive integer 'n' and returns the corresponding element in the sequence
function fib = fibonacci(n)
    % Initialize the first two elements in the sequence
    fib(1) = 0;
    fib(2) = 1;
    
    % Loop through the remaining elements
    for i = 3:n
        % Calculate the next element by adding the two previous elements
        fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2);
    end
    
    % Return the nth element in the sequence
    fib = fib(n);
end
