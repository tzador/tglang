% This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
% Input: number - the number to find the factorial of
% Output: factorial - the value of the factorial

function factorial = calculate_factorial(number)

% Check if the number is greater than or equal to 0
if number >= 0
    factorial = 1; % Initialize the factorial value to 1

    % Loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number
    for i = 1:number
        factorial = factorial * i; % Multiply the current factorial value by the current number
    end
    
    % Print the result to the console
    disp("The factorial of " + number + " is " + factorial);
    
else % If the number is negative, throw an error
    error("Invalid input! Number must be greater than or equal to 0.");
