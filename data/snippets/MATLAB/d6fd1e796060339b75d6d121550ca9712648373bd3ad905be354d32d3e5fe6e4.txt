% This code snippet creates a function that takes in a matrix
% as input and performs a series of complex matrix operations on it.

% Define the function with input argument 'A'
function B = complexMatrixOperation(A)

% Transpose the input matrix A
A_transpose = A';

% Calculate the determinant of A multiplied by its inverse
det_A = det(A);
det_A_inverse = 1/det_A;

% Create a vector of ones with length equal to the number of rows in A
ones_vector = ones(size(A,1),1);

% Multiply the column vector of ones by the inverse of A
ones_vector_A_inverse = ones_vector*A_inverse;

% Calculate the sum of all elements in A
sum_A = sum(A(:));

% Create a diagonal matrix with the diagonal values calculated from A
diag_A = diag(A);

% Create a matrix of random numbers with the same dimensions as A
random_matrix = rand(size(A));

% Perform element-wise multiplication between A and the random matrix
A_times_random = A.*random_matrix;

% Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A
[eval_A, evec_A] = eig(A);

% Calculate the matrix multiplication between A and its eigenvectors
A_times_evec = A*evec_A;

% Calculate the inverse of A multiplied by its transpose
A_inverse_times_transpose = inv(A)*A';

% Create a matrix with the same dimensions as A and fill it with zeros
zero_matrix = zeros(size(A));

% Concatenate all the calculated matrices into one final matrix B
B = [A_transpose, det_A_inverse, ones_vector_A_inverse, sum_A, diag_A, random_matrix, A_times_random, eval_A, evec_A, A_times_evec, A_inverse_times_transpose, zero_matrix];
