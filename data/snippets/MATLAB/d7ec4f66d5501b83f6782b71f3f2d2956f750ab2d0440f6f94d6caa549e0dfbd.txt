%% Setup
% This section sets up the variables and initial values needed for the following calculations.
x = linspace(0,10,1000); % Create a vector of 1000 equally spaced points between 0 and 10
A = diag(rand(1000,1)); % Create a diagonal matrix of size 1000x1000 with random values on the diagonal
B = eye(1000); % Create an identity matrix of size 1000x1000

%% Main Calculation
% This section performs the main calculation, multiplying the matrices A and B and
% taking the sine of the resulting matrix.
C = sin(A*B); % Multiply A and B, then take the sine of the resulting matrix

%% Plotting
% This section plots the results of the calculation.
figure; % Create a new figure
plot(x,C); % Plot the vector x against the matrix C
title('Sine of A*B'); % Add a title to the plot
xlabel('x'); % Add a label to the x-axis
ylabel('sin(A*B)'); % Add a label to the y-axis
legend('sin(A*B)'); % Add a legend to the plot
