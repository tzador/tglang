%% Generating a random vector and finding its magnitude

% Creating a random vector of size 10x1
vec = rand(10,1);

% Calculating the magnitude of the vector using the Euclidean norm formula
mag = sqrt(sum(vec.^2));

% Printing the original vector and its magnitude to the console
disp("Original vector: ");
disp(vec);
disp("Magnitude: ");
disp(mag);
