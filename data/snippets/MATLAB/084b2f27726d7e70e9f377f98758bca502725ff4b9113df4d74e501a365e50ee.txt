% This code snippet calculates the sum of all odd numbers minus the sum of all even numbers 
% within a given range of numbers

% defining the range of numbers
start_num = 1;
end_num = 10;

% initializing variables to store the sums
odd_sum = 0;
even_sum = 0;

% loop through the range of numbers
for i = start_num:end_num
    % check if the number is even
    if mod(i, 2) == 0
        % add the number to the even sum
        even_sum = even_sum + i;
    else
        % add the number to the odd sum
        odd_sum = odd_sum + i;
    end
end

% calculate the difference between the odd sum and even sum
diff = odd_sum - even_sum;

% display the result
disp(['The difference between the sum of odd numbers and the sum of even numbers within the range ' num2str(start_num) ' to ' num2str(end_num) ' is ' num2str(diff) '.']);

% Output:
% The difference between the sum of odd numbers and the sum of even numbers within the range 1 to 10 is -5.
