%% Generate a random matrix
% This code snippet generates a random matrix of size 5 by 5, with values ranging from 0 to 10.
matrix = rand(5,5) * 10;

%% Apply a condition to the matrix
% This code snippet applies a condition to the generated matrix, setting values less than 5 to 0.
condition = matrix < 5;
matrix(condition) = 0;

%% Find the max value and its index
% This code snippet finds the maximum value in the matrix and its corresponding index.
[max_val, max_idx] = max(matrix(:));

%% Display the result
disp("The generated matrix with values less than 5 set to 0 is:")
disp(matrix)
disp("The maximum value is:")
disp(max_val)
disp("The index of the maximum value is:")
disp(max_idx)
