%%% Solving a system of linear equations using LU decomposition %%%
%% Create a random matrix and vector of coefficients
A = rand(5);  % creates a 5x5 matrix of random values
b = rand(5, 1);  % creates a 5x1 vector of random values
%% Perform LU decomposition on matrix A
[L, U] = lu(A);  % returns lower and upper triangular matrices L and U
%% Solve the system by substitution
y = L\b;  % solves for vector y in Ly = b
x = U\y;  % solves for vector x in Ux = y
%% Display results
fprintf('Coefficient vector x:\n');
disp(x);  % displays vector x with appropriate formatting
fprintf('Original matrix A times coefficient vector x:\n');
disp(A*x);  % displays product of matrix A and vector x with appropriate formatting
fprintf('Original vector b:\n');
disp(b);  % displays vector b with appropriate formatting
fprintf('Difference between A*x and b:\n');
disp(A*x - b);  % displays difference between product of matrix A and vector x and vector b with appropriate formatting
