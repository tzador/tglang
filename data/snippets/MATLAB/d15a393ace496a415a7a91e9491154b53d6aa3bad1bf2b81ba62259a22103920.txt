function [x, y] = solveEquations(a, b, c)
% This function solves a system of two equations with two unknowns
% Inputs:
%   a: coefficient of x in first equation
%   b: coefficient of y in first equation
%   c: constant term in first equation
% Outputs:
%   x: solution for x
%   y: solution for y

% calculate a coefficient of y in second equation
b2 = -b / a;

% solve for y in second equation
y = (c + b2) / (1 + b2);

% substitute y in first equation
x = (c - b * y) / a;

% print solutions
fprintf('The solutions to the equations are x = %f and y = %f', x, y);
