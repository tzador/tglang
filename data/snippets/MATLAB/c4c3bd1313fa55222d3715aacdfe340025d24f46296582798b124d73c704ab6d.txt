x = linspace(0,10,100); % Creates a vector with 100 equally spaced elements between 0 and 10
y = sin(x); % Calculates the sine of each element in the vector x and stores it in vector y
plot(x,y); % Plots y against x on a 2D graph
xlabel('x'); % Adds x-label to the graph
ylabel('y'); % Adds y-label to the graph
title('Sine Function'); % Adds title to the graph
grid on; % Turns on grid lines on the graph
xlim([0,10]); % Sets the x-axis limits
ylim([-1,1]); % Sets the y-axis limits
legend({'sin(x)'}, 'Location', 'northwest'); % Adds legend to the graph at the top left corner
