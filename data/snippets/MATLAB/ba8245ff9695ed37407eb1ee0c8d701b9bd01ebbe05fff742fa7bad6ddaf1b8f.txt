%% Define Constants and Variables

% Initialize constants for gravitational acceleration (g) and drag coefficient (c)
g = 9.8;
c = 0.5;

% Set initial conditions for mass (m), time (t), and height (h)
m = 1;
t = 0;
h = 0;

%% Set Up Differential Equations

% Define function for differential equations of motion
function dydt = eqns(t,y)
    % Calculate variables for differential equations
    v = y(1);
    y(2) = y(2) + g*t;
    
    % Calculate drag force and acceleration
    F_drag = 0.5*c*v^2;
    a = (g - F_drag)/m;
    
    % Update velocity and height using Euler's method
    dydt = [a; v];
end

%% Solve Differential Equations

% Set initial conditions for velocity (v) and height (h)
v0 = 0;
h0 = 0;

% Set integration time and step size
tspan = [0, 5];
step = 0.01;

% Use built-in solver ode45 to solve differential equations
[T, Y] = ode45(@eqns, tspan, [v0; h0], [], step);

%% Plot Results

% Plot height vs. time
