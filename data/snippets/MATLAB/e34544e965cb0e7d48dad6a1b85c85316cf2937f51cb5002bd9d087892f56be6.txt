% The following code snippet calculates the average of all elements in a given matrix
A = randi([0, 10], 5); % generate a 5x5 matrix with random integer values from 0 to 10
[row, col] = size(A); % get the dimensions of the matrix
sum = 0; % initialize the sum variable
for i = 1:row
    for j = 1:col
        sum = sum + A(i, j); % add each element to the sum variable
    end
end
avrg = sum/(row*col); % calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total number of elements
disp(avrg); % display the average value
