%% Generate a random matrix A with dimensions 5x5
A = rand(5,5);

% Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A
[eig_vals, eig_vecs] = eig(A);

% Create a new matrix B by adding 2 to each element of A
B = A + 2;

% Calculate the inverse of B
B_inv = inv(B);

% Get the norm of matrix B
B_norm = norm(B);

% Create a vector c with values ranging from 1 to 10
c = 1:10;

% Calculate the dot product of c with itself
c_dot = dot(c,c);

% Find the largest element in matrix A
A_max = max(A,[],'all');

% Resize matrix A to be 8x8
A = imresize(A,[8 8]);

% Create a cell array containing the strings 'hello' and 'world'
strs = {'hello','world'};

% Determine the number of elements in the cell array
str_count = numel(strs);

% Create a matrix C with dimensions 5x3x2
C = rand(5,3,2);

% Perform element-wise multiplication of matrix A with matrix B
A_times_B = A .* B;

% Calculate the sum of each column in matrix C
C_col_sum = sum(C,1);

% Determine the size of matrix B
B_size = size(B);
