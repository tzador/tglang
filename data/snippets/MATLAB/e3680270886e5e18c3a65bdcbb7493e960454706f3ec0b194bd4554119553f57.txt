%% Matrix Operations
% This code snippet shows examples of matrix operations in MATLAB
% Create a 3x3 matrix A
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9]; 
% Create a 3x1 column vector b
b = [1; 2; 3];
% Calculate the determinant of matrix A
detA = det(A);
% Calculate the inverse of matrix A
invA = inv(A);
% Create a 1x3 row vector c
c = [1, 2, 3];
% Calculate the matrix multiplication of A and b
Ab = A*b;
% Calculate the element-wise multiplication of A and c
Ac = A.*c;
% Calculate the transpose of matrix A
transposeA = A';
% Calculate the element-wise exponentiation of matrix A
A_exp = A.^2;
% Calculate the trace of matrix A
trA = trace(A);
% Calculate the norm of matrix A
normA = norm(A);
% Calculate the rank of matrix A
rankA = rank(A);
