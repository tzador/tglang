% This code snippet generates a random matrix of size m-by-n and calculates
% its singular value decomposition and inverse using the built-in functions
% svd() and inv(). It then performs a matrix multiplication between the
% original matrix and its inverse and compares the result to the identity
% matrix to check the accuracy of the calculations.

% Define the size of the matrix
m = 5;
n = 3;

% Generate a random m-by-n matrix with values between 0 and 1
A = rand(m,n);

% Calculate the singular value decomposition of matrix A
[U, S, V] = svd(A);

% Obtain the diagonal matrix of singular values from S
D = diag(S);

% Construct the inverse matrix using the U, D, and V matrices
A_inv = V * inv(diag(D)) * U';

% Calculate the result of A multiplied by its inverse
A_mult = A * A_inv;

% Check the accuracy by comparing the result to the identity matrix of size m-by-m
isequal(A_mult, eye(m))
