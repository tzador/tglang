% This code snippet generates multiple plots with different colors and styles
close all; % closes all open figures

% set up data for plots
x = linspace(-pi, pi, 100);
y = sin(x);
z = cos(x);

% create first figure and title
figure;
title('Plot 1');

% plot first set of data and customize plot
plot(x, y, 'r--'); % plot with red dashed line
hold on; % hold current figure
plot(x, z, 'b-'); % plot with blue solid line

% create second figure and title
figure;
title('Plot 2');

% plot second set of data and customize plot
plot(x, y, 'g-.'); % plot with green dotted line
hold on; % hold current figure
plot(x, z, 'k--'); % plot with black dashed line

% create third figure and title
figure;
title('Plot 3');

% plot third set of data and customize plot
plot(x, y, 'c-'); % plot with cyan solid line
hold on; % hold current figure
plot(x, z, 'm:'); % plot with magenta dotted line

% create fourth figure and title
figure;
title('Plot 4');

% plot fourth set of data and customize plot
plot(x, y, 'y-'); % plot with yellow solid line
hold on; % hold current figure
plot(x, z, 'r-.'); % plot with red dotted line

% create fifth figure and title
figure;
title('Plot 5');

% plot fifth set of data and customize plot
plot(x, y, 'b:'); % plot with blue dotted line
hold on; % hold current figure
plot(x, z, 'g-'); % plot with green solid line

% create sixth figure and title
figure;
title('Plot 6');

% plot sixth set of data and customize plot
plot(x, y, 'k--'); % plot with black dashed line
hold on; % hold current figure
plot(x, z, 'c:'); % plot with cyan dotted line
