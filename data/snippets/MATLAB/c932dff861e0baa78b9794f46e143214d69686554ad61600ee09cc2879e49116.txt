% This code snippet generates a matrix of random numbers and performs matrix multiplication using built-in functions

% Generate a 5x5 matrix of random integers between 1 and 10
A = randi([1,10],5,5)

% Generate a 5x5 matrix of random decimal values between 0 and 1
B = rand(5)

% Perform matrix multiplication using the MATLAB built-in function 'mtimes'
C = mtimes(A,B)

% Display the resulting matrix C
disp(C)
