% Define a symbolic variable x
syms x

% Create a matrix containing x^2, x^3, and x^4 as elements
A = [x^2, x^3, x^4];

% Create a vector containing 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 as elements
v = 0:9;

% Create a new matrix by multiplying each element of A with each element of v
B = A.*v;

% Generate a random 5x5 matrix with elements between 0 and 1
C = rand(5);

% Create a matrix D with the same size as B, containing 2 as every element
D = ones(size(B))*2;

% Add the matrices B and D element-wise and store the result in a new matrix E
E = B + D;

% Create a logical vector with values of 0s and 1s, where 1 corresponds to elements in C greater than 0.5
logic = C>0.5;

% Take the square root of each element in logistic and store the result in a new matrix F
F = sqrt(logic);

% Calculate the sum of all elements in F and store it in a variable sum_F
sum_F = sum(sum(F));

% Display the value of sum_F
disp(sum_F);
