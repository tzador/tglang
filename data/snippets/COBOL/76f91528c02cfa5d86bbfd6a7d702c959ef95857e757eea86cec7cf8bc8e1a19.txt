---------------------------------------------------------------------
This COBOL code snippet is a program for calculating payroll for a company's employees. It is primarily divided into three sections: Identification, Environment, and Procedure. The code starts with the "IDENTIFICATION DIVISION" which defines the name of the program as "CALCULATE-PAYROLL". The next section is "ENVIRONMENT DIVISION" which specifies the computing environment and the "DATA DIVISION" which declares the data and file structure used in the program.

In this snippet, the file "EMPLOYEE-FILE" is declared in the file section and its record structure "EMPLOYEE-RECORD" is defined with fields for employee name, ID, salary, and tax rate. The working-storage section declares two variables for storing the total wages and tax calculated.

Moving into the procedure division, the program starts with a loop labeled as "001-MAIN-LOOP". Inside this loop, the employee file is opened and the records are read one by one using the "READ" statement. The loop is executed continuously until the employee ID is equal to 0. After the loop, the file is closed and the calculated totals for wages and tax are displayed using the "DISPLAY" statement.

The next section of the procedure division is labeled as "002-CALCULATE-WAGES" which is used in the main loop. Here, the salary and tax rate are multiplied, and the result is stored in the total tax variable. Then, the total tax is added to the total wages variable.

Finally, the program is ended with the statement "END OF PROGRAM CALCULATE-PAYROLL." This is the code snippet for a COBOL program that calculates payroll for employees based on their salary and tax rate.
