This is a data structure in COBOL for managing personnel information in a company. It includes fields for basic employee information such as name, ID, department, position, salary, start date, end date, manager ID, and work hours. It also includes an array for personnel history, with fields for past employee IDs, job titles, departments, salary, start date, and end date. Additionally, there is a section for benefits data, with fields for retirement and health plans. The structure ends with an unused field for any additional data that may be needed in the future.

To use this structure in a COBOL program, the user can define a record of type WS-PERSONNEL-DATA and assign values to each field. The OCCURS clause in the personnel history section allows for multiple records to be stored in the array. This structure can be used to efficiently store and retrieve personnel information in a company's database.
