       In COBOL, the IDENTIFICATION DIVISION is used to identify the program and provide basic information such as the PROGRAM-ID.
       The DATA DIVISION is where the program specifies and declares its data items.
       The WORKING-STORAGE SECTION is used to store working variables.
       In this code snippet, we have defined three variables - RADIUS, PI, and AREA - using the PIC (picture) clause to indicate the type and length of each variable.
       The PROCEDURE DIVISION is where the actual code for the program is written.
       In this snippet, we first prompt the user to enter a value for the RADIUS variable, using the DISPLAY and ACCEPT statements.
       Next, we use the COMPUTE statement to calculate the AREA and PERIMETER using the formula for a circle.
       Finally, we use the DISPLAY statement to print the results of our calculations.
       The STOP RUN statement indicates the end of the program.
