The above code snippet is a COBOL program that reads data from a file called "SAMPLE-FILE" and counts the number of records with age greater than 18. It starts by identifying the program and setting the environment for an IBM-390 computer. Then, it defines the input file and its record layout in the "FILE SECTION" and the working variables in the "WORKING-STORAGE SECTION". The "PROCEDURE DIVISION" contains the main logic of the program, where it first opens the input file, reads the first record, and starts a loop that will continue until the record's ID reaches "999999". Within the loop, it checks if the age is greater than 18 and displays the record's name and age if it is. It also increases the count by 1. Once the loop ends, the file is closed and the total number of records processed is displayed.
