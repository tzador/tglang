 /* This code snippet is a simple "Hello World" program written in COBOL.
  It starts with the IDENTIFICATION DIVISION, specifying the program ID and author.
  The ENVIRONMENT DIVISION is used to specify the source and object computers.
  Next, the DATA DIVISION is used to declare working storage variables.
  In this case, two variables named WS-NAME and WS-WORLD are declared with initial values.
  Finally, the PROCEDURE DIVISION contains the main routine, which displays the values of WS-NAME and WS-WORLD on the console, concatenates them into a single variable WS-OUTPUT, and then displays the concatenated value on the console. The program ends with a STOP RUN statement. */},
