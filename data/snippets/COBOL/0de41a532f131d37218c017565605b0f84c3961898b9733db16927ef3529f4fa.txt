* A sample code snippet in COBOL showing how a response from a external service is received and processed.
* WS-CALL-RESPONSE would contain the response from the service.

* The code checks if the response is successful, and if yes, executes the success logic.
* If the response is a failure, the failure logic is called.
* If the response is neither success nor failure, it is assumed to be an error and the error message is moved to a variable WS-ERROR-MSG.
* The process error logic is then called to handle the error.
