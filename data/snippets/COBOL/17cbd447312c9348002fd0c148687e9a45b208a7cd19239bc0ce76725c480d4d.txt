    *> This is a program that calculates the area of a rectangle
    *> This snippet declares variables and captures user input
    *> assumes that `PI` is already defined as a constant in the program

    01 LENGTH PIC 9(3). *> declare LENGTH as a 3-digit numeric variable
    01 WIDTH PIC 9(3). *> declare WIDTH as a 3-digit numeric variable
    01 RADIUS PIC 9(3)V9(2). *> declare RADIUS as a 5-digit numeric variable with 2 decimal places
    01 AREA PIC 9(6)V9(3). *> declare AREA as a 9-digit numeric variable with 3 decimal places

    DISPLAY "Please enter the length of the rectangle:" WITH NO ADVANCING.
    ACCEPT LENGTH. *> captures user input and stores it in LENGTH variable
    DISPLAY "Please enter the width of the rectangle:" WITH NO ADVANCING.
    ACCEPT WIDTH. *> captures user input and stores it in WIDTH variable

    *> This snippet performs the calculation using the formula A=π*r*r

    COMPUTE RADIUS = LENGTH * WIDTH. *> multiply the length and width to get the radius
    COMPUTE AREA = PI * RADIUS * RADIUS. *> calculates the area using the formula A=π*r*r

    *> This snippet displays the output to the user

    DISPLAY "The area of the rectangle is:" WITH NO ADVANCING.
    DISPLAY AREA WITH PREFIX " " WITH TRAILING " square units". *> display the area with appropriate units

    STOP RUN. *> end of program
