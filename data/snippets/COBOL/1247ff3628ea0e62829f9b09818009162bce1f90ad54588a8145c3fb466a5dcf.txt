*** This is a program written in COBOL that calculates the factorial of a number ***

IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.       *** This division identifies the program ***
PROGRAM-ID. FACTORIAL-PROGRAM. *** The program is named 'FACTORIAL-PROGRAM' ***

DATA DIVISION.                 *** This division defines the data used in the program ***
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.       *** This section defines variables and temporary storage ***
01 NUM  PIC 9(5) VALUE 0.      *** 'NUM' is the input number to calculate factorial ***
01 FACT  PIC 9(10) VALUE 1.    *** 'FACT' is the factorial value that will be calculated ***

PROCEDURE DIVISION.            *** This division contains the logic and instructions for the program ***

MAIN-LOGIC.                    *** This paragraph is the starting point of the program ***

DISPLAY "Enter a number:"      *** Displays a prompt message to the user ***
ACCEPT NUM                     *** Accepts user input and stores it in 'NUM' variable ***

IF NUM < 0                     *** Checks if input number is less than 0 ***
    DISPLAY "Error: Negative numbers do not have a factorial" *** Displays error message ***
ELSE
    PERFORM CALCULATE-FACTORIAL *** Calls paragraph to calculate the factorial ***

DISPLAY "The factorial of " NUM " is " FACT. *** Displays the result to the user ***

STOP RUN.                      *** Stops the program ***

CALCULATE-FACTORIAL.           *** This paragraph calculates the factorial of the input number ***

MULTIPLY FACT BY NUM           *** Multiplies 'FACT' by 'NUM' variable ***
SUBTRACT NUM FROM 1            *** Subtracts 1 from 'NUM' variable ***
IF NUM > 1                     *** Checks if 'NUM' is still greater than 1 ***
    PERFORM CALCULATE-FACTORIAL *** Calls itself recursively to continue the calculation ***
END-IF.

EXIT.                          *** Exits the paragraph ***
