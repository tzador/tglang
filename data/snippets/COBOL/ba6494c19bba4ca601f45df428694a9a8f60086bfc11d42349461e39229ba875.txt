           OPEN OUTPUT OUTPUT-FILE.        * This statement opens the output file for writing
           READ INPUT-FILE INTO INPUT-RECORD.* This statement reads the first record from the input file
           PERFORM CALCULATE-SALARY UNTIL INPUT-FILE-EOF.    * This statement loops until end of file is reached
           CLOSE INPUT-FILE.               * This statement closes the input file
