WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
01 WS-BASE PIC 9(4)V9(2). (Base with maximum 4 digits before decimal point and 2 digits after)
01 WS-HEIGHT PIC 9(4)V9(2). (Height with maximum 4 digits before decimal point and 2 digits after)
01 WS-AREA PIC 9(6)V9(2). (Area with maximum 6 digits before decimal point and 2 digits after)
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
*Taking input for base and height from user
ACCEPT WS-BASE.
ACCEPT WS-HEIGHT.
*Calculating area using formula: area = 0.5 * base * height
COMPUTE WS-AREA = 0.5 * WS-BASE * WS-HEIGHT.
*Displaying the result to the user
DISPLAY "The area of the triangle is " WS-AREA.
