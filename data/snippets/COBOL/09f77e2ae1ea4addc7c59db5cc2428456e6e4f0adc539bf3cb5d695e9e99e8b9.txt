       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01 LENGTH PIC 9(3).
       01 WIDTH PIC 9(3).
       01 AREA PIC 9(5).
       01 PERIMETER PIC 9(5).

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       * Prompt user to enter length
       DISPLAY "Enter length:".
       ACCEPT LENGTH.

       * Prompt user to enter width
       DISPLAY "Enter width:".
       ACCEPT WIDTH.

       * Calculate area = length * width
       MULTIPLY LENGTH BY WIDTH GIVING AREA.

       * Calculate perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
       ADD LENGTH TO WIDTH GIVING PERIMETER.
       MULTIPLY PERIMETER BY 2 GIVING PERIMETER.

       * Display results
       DISPLAY "The area is " AREA " and the perimeter is " PERIMETER.
