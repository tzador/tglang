IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.                     * This is the identification division, which is used to identify the program.
       PROGRAM-ID. COMPLEX_CALC.                     * The program-id is the name of the program.
       AUTHOR. YOUR_NAME.                            * The author is the name of the programmer.
       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.                         * The environment division is used to specify the environment in which the program will run.
       CONFIGURATION SECTION.                        * The configuration section is used to specify the configuration of the program.
       SOURCE-COMPUTER. YOUR_COMPUTER.               * The source-computer is the name of the computer where the program will be compiled.
       OBJECT-COMPUTER. YOUR_OBJECT_COMPUTER.        * The object-computer is the name of the computer where the program will be executed.

       DATA DIVISION.                                * The data division is used to define the data used in the program.
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.                      * The working-storage section is used to declare variables used in the program.
       01 NUM1 PIC 9(3).                             * The variable 'NUM1' is declared as a numeric field with 3 digits.
       01 NUM2 PIC 9(3).                             * The variable 'NUM2' is declared as a numeric field with 3 digits.
       01 RESULT PIC 9(4).                           * The variable 'RESULT' is declared as a numeric field with 4 digits.

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.                           * The procedure division contains the actual code of the program.
       MAIN-PROCEDURE SECTION.                       * The main-procedure section is the central part of the program.
       COMPUTE RESULT = NUM1 + NUM2.                 * The 'COMPUTE' statement is used to perform arithmetic operations and assign the result to a variable.
       DISPLAY "The result is:" RESULT.              * The 'DISPLAY' statement is used to output a message to the user.
       STOP RUN.                                     * The 'STOP RUN' statement terminates the execution of the program.
       END PROGRAM COMPLEX_CALC.                     * The 'END PROGRAM' statement marks the end of the program.

       **Example input and output:**

       *Input:*                                       
               NUM1 = 123                                 
               NUM2 = 456                             

       *Output:*                                      
               The result is: 579
