      //* The above code snippet is for a simple COBOL program that asks for two numbers from the user, multiplies them, and displays the result.

      //* The `IDENTIFICATION DIVISION` identifies the program and its purpose.

      //* The `PROGRAM-ID` gives the program a name.

      //* The `DATA DIVISION` declares data elements to be used in the program.

      //* The `01` level indicates that the following variable is a top-level data item.

      //* The `PIC` clause describes the format and type of the variable.

      //* The `WORKING-STORAGE SECTION` is used for temporary variables that are not passed in or out of the program.

      //* The `PROCEDURE DIVISION` contains the instructions for the program to execute.

      //* The `DISPLAY` statement prints the given string to the screen.

      //* The `ACCEPT` statement takes input from the user and assigns it to the specified variable.

      //* The `MULTIPLY` statement performs multiplication on two variables and stores the result in a third variable.

      //* The `GIVING` clause specifies which variable will hold the result of the operation.

      //* The `STOP RUN` statement indicates the end of the program.

      //* The output of this code snippet would be:
      //* Enter first number:
      //* Enter second number:
      //* The result is: 250
