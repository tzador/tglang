             * Explanation:
             * 
             * This code snippet starts by defining a program name 'PROD_CALC'.
             * It then declares three variables, NUM1 and NUM2 for input numbers,
             * and PRODUCT for storing the product. The variables are initialized
             * to be able to use them later.
             * 
             * In the procedure division, the '000-INITIALIZE' section displays 
             * prompts and accepts the input numbers from the user. It also sets
             * the PRODUCT variable to 0.
             * 
             * The '100-CALCULATE' section calculates the product by adding 
             * NUM2 to PRODUCT and subtracting 1 from NUM1. This process is 
             * repeated until NUM1 is greater than 0.
             * 
             * Finally, the product is displayed in the '200-DISPLAY' section 
             * and the program ends by stopping the execution.
             * 
             * This program takes two numbers and calculates their product 
             * using a loop and displays it on the screen.
