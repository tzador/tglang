* This code snippet reads input data from a file and writes it to an output file
* using the MOVE and WRITE statements to transfer data between records.
* It uses a loop until the end of the input file is reached.
* The data is read into a record with two fields: a name and an age.
* The name is then moved to an output record and written to the output file.
* The program uses placeholder values for the names of the input and output files.
