/\* Regular expression to match an email address. *\

/[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}/i
/* This regex pattern will match an email address in any format. 
It starts with a set of character classes to include letters, numbers, and certain special characters that can appear in an email address.
The next part is the "@" symbol, followed by another set of character classes for the domain name which can also include numbers and hyphens.
Finally, we use the {2,} quantifier to ensure that the top-level domain is at least 2 characters long, which is the minimum for most common domain extensions. 
The "i" modifier at the end makes the pattern case-insensitive.
This regular expression can be used to validate user input or extract email addresses from a larger string of text. */
