/^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9])(?=.*?[!@#\$&*\(\)\^\-_\+=]).{8,}$/g

Description: This regular expression checks for a string with at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. It also checks for a minimum length of 8 characters.

Explanations: 
- `^` asserts that matching starts at the beginning of the string
- `(?=.*?[A-Z])` checks for at least one uppercase letter using positive lookahead
- `(?=.*?[a-z])` checks for at least one lowercase letter using positive lookahead
- `(?=.*?[0-9])` checks for at least one number using positive lookahead
- `(?=.*?[!@#\$&*\(\)\^\-_\+=])` checks for at least one special character using positive lookahead
- `.{8,}` checks for a minimum length of 8 characters
- `$` asserts that matching ends at the end of the string
- `/g` global flag for matching all occurrences in the string
