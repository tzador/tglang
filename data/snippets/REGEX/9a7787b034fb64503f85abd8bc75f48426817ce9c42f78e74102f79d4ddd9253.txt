/*
This regular expression snippet uses positive lookbehind and positive lookahead to match names that have either "John" or "Jane" as the first name, followed by "lastName" or "surname" as the next word. It then captures the first name using a positive lookbehind for either "firstName" or "givenName" and any word characters that are not followed by a whitespace. Next, it captures the last name using a word character lookahead that is not followed by "john" and any characters. Finally, it uses negative lookbehind to ensure that neither "Jane" nor "John" appear before the end of the string.
