// This regex pattern will match strings of numbers separated by commas
/\d+(,\d+)*/

/* 
Explanation:
- The first part, \d+ matches one or more digits
- The second part, (,\d+) is a group that matches a comma followed by one or more digits
- The * at the end allows for the group to be repeated zero or more times, allowing for multiple numbers separated by commas to be matched.
