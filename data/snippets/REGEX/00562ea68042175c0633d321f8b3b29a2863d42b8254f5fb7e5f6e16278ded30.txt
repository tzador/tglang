/^(?=.*[!@#$%^&*()+\-=\[\]{};':"\\|,.<>\/?])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[0-9]).{8,}$/
Explanation: This REGEX pattern will match a string that contains at least one special character, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number, with a minimum length of 8 characters. The caret (^) indicates the match must start at the beginning of the string. The dollar sign ($) indicates the match must end at the end of the string. The lookaheads (?=) ensure that the string contains the specified criteria without consuming any characters. The asterisk (*) means zero or more occurrences of the preceding characters. The dot (.) represents any single character. The forward slashes (/) enclose the REGEX pattern.
