`^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[^\da-zA-Z]).{8,}$`
This regular expression is designed to match a password that meets the following criteria:
- Has at least one lowercase letter
- Has at least one uppercase letter
- Has at least one number
- Has at least one special character
- Is at least 8 characters long

Breaking down the pattern:
- `^` : Matches the beginning of the string
- `(?=.*[a-z])` : Positive lookahead to ensure there is at least one lowercase letter
- `(?=.*[A-Z])` : Positive lookahead to ensure there is at least one uppercase letter
- `(?=.*\d)` : Positive lookahead to ensure there is at least one number
- `(?=.*[^\da-zA-Z])` : Positive lookahead to ensure there is at least one special character
- `.{8,}` : Matches any character (except line breaks) and is at least 8 characters long
- `$` : Matches the end of the string
