/*
    This regex pattern searches for strings within comments
    and replaces them with empty strings, effectively
    removing the comments from the code.

    (?<=\w) - positive lookbehind assertion for any word character
    (\") - matches and captures the opening quotation mark
    (\w*?) - matches any word characters lazily
    (?=\") - positive lookahead assertion for the closing quotation mark 

    (/\*.*?\*/) - matches and captures any string within the comment block 
    (?=\") - positive lookahead assertion for the closing quotation mark 
    
    (\w*?) - matches any word characters lazily 
    (?=\") - positive lookahead assertion for the closing quotation mark 
    (\") - matches and captures the closing quotation mark 

    The overall regex pattern matches and captures the string within
    quotation marks within a comment block and replaces it with
    an empty string.
