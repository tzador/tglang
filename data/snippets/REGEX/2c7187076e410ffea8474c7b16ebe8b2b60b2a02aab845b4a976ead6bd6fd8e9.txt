(?<=\w)[A-Z](?=\w) 
// This regex matches any uppercase letter that is preceded and followed by a word character (excludes special characters).
// It uses positive lookbehind (?<=) and positive lookahead (?=) to ensure that the uppercase letter is not at the beginning or end of a string.
// The pattern in between matches a single word character using \w and the uppercase letter is represented with [A-Z].
// This regex snippet can be used to match and extract any acronym or proper noun within a string.
// Example: "Hello REGEX World!" will match and extract "REGEX" as the output.
