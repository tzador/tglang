/^([a-z]+)([A-Z]+)(\d+)$/gm  
/*This regular expression will match strings that begin with one or more lowercase letters, followed by one or more uppercase letters, and ending with one or more digits.
The 'gm' flags are used for global and multiline matching, respectively.
The parentheses allow for capturing groups for the different parts of the string.
For example, the string "abcdEFG123" would result in three capture groups: "abcd", "EFG", and "123".*/
