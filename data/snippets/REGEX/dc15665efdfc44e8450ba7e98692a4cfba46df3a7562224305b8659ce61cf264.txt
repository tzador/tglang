/^(?:\w+\.)+$/

/*
This regex looks for a set of one or more word characters followed by a period and captures the entire set.
The use of a non-capturing group (indicated by the "?:") allows for a repetition of the group multiple times.
The use of the caret (^) and dollar sign ($) anchors ensures that the entire string must match the regex.
