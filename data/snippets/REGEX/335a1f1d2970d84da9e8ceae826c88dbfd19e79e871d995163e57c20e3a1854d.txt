// This regex code snippet allows you to identify and extract all email addresses from a given text

import re // importing the regular expression library

text = "I have two email addresses: john@example.com and jane@example.com" // sample text to extract email addresses from

pattern = "[a-z0-9\.\-+_]+@[a-z0-9\.\-+_]+\.[a-z]+" 
// using a regular expression pattern to match email addresses, starting with one or more alphabets and numbers, followed by @ symbol, then one or more alphabets and numbers, followed by a period, then one or more alphabets

emails = re.findall(pattern, text) // using the findall function to return all matches of the pattern in the given text

print(emails) // printing the extracted email addresses

// Output:
['john@example.com', 'jane@example.com'] 
// all email addresses in the given text are extracted and returned as a list of strings
