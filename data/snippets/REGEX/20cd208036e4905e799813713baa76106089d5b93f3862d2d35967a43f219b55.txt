/^(?!^(\s*\w+){1,5}$).*$/

/*
Explanation:
The beginning of the regex, ^, followed by 
a negative lookahead, (?!...), identifying the start of a group.
The group starts with ^ to indicate the beginning of the string.
Next, we use a quantifier, {1,5} to limit the number of times 
the group can repeat to avoid excessive matching.
Inside the group, we use a combination of \s, which matches whitespace, 
and \w, which matches any word character.
The * indicates that the group can be repeated multiple times.
The $ symbol denotes the end of the string.
Overall, this regex is looking for any string that does not have 1 to 5 groups 
of whitespace followed by word characters, effectively filtering out strings 
that are too short or too long.
