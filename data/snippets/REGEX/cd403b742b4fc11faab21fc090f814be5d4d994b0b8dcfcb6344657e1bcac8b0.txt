/^([a-z]+)(\d{2})(-)([A-Z]{3})\s*(\d{2})([a-zA-Z]{3})(@\w+(\.\w+){2})$/

This code snippet is a regular expression that checks for a specific pattern in a given string. It starts with a caret symbol (^) to indicate the beginning of the string, followed by a set of parentheses to group the different parts of the pattern.

The first group ([a-z]+) is a character set that matches one or more lowercase letters. This is followed by another group (\d{2}) which matches exactly two digits. The next part of the pattern is a hyphen (-) which is a literal character that must be present in the string.

The fourth group ([A-Z]{3}) is another character set, this time matching exactly three uppercase letters. Then there is the \s* which represents zero or more whitespace characters. This is followed by the fifth group (\d{2}) which matches exactly two digits and then the sixth group ([a-zA-Z]{3}) which matches exactly three letters, both lowercase and uppercase.

After this, there is the @ symbol which is a literal character that must be present in the string. The next part of the pattern is a group (\w+) which matches one or more alphanumeric characters, followed by another group (\.\w+){2} which matches a literal period (.) followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, and this is repeated twice.

The pattern ends with a dollar sign ($) to indicate the end of the string.

Overall, this regular expression can be used to check if a string follows a specific format, such as a username or an email address.
