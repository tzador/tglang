/^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4}$/i

Explanation: This regex code checks for valid email addresses by using the following rules:
- The email address can contain lowercase letters, numbers and special characters such as ., _ , % , + and -.
- The first part of the email address must be at least one character long and can contain any of the allowed characters.
- The second part of the email address must be at least one character long and can contain any of the allowed characters.
- The second part of the email address must contain a '.' followed by at least two or a maximum of four lowercase letters.
- The email address must end with one of the allowed top-level domains (TLDs), which are typically .com, .org, .net or .edu.
- The 'i' at the end of the regex makes it case-insensitive, so it will match both lowercase and uppercase letters.
- The ^ and $ symbols indicate that the regex should match the entire email address, ensuring that there are no extra characters before or after.
