# Match One or More Words Followed by a Comma and a Space
(\\w+,\\s)

Explanation:
# The backslash is used to escape the following character, in this case it is used to escape the special character '\' in the regex pattern.
# The parentheses are used to group the pattern together.
# '\w' is a metacharacter that matches any word character, equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_].
# The plus sign '+' signifies that the preceding pattern should occur one or more times.
# The comma ',' matches a literal comma in the string.
# The backslash followed by the letter 's' '\s' matches any whitespace character, equivalent to [\t\n\r\f\v].
# This regex pattern will match any string that contains one or more words followed by a comma and a space, such as "hello, " or "programming is fun, ".
