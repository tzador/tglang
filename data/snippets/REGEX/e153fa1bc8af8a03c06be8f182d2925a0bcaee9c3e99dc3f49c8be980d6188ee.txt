/(?<filename>.+)\.(?<extension>\w+)/
// This is a Regular Expression that captures a filename and its extension from a string.
// The syntax (?<filename>...) creates a named capturing group for the filename.
// The period "\." matches any character, while the plus sign "+" matches one or more occurrences.
// The syntax "\.(?<extension>...)" creates another named capturing group for the extension.
// The backslash "\w" matches any word character (letters, digits, underscore) and the plus sign matches one or more occurrences.
// The forward slashes "/" at the beginning and end indicate the start and end of the regex pattern.
// This regex can be used to extract the filename and extension from a string, for example:
// let str = "my_file.png";
// let matches = str.match(/(?<filename>.+)\.(?<extension>\w+)/);
// The matches variable will now contain an array with the filename and extension accessible through named capture groups.
// matches.groups.filename // "my_file"
// matches.groups.extension // "png"
// Note: The syntax for named capture groups may vary depending on the programming language used.
