// This regex pattern will match any email address
/[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,3}/

// Explanation:
// The square brackets [] denote a character set, meaning we can match any character within this set
// In this case, we are matching lowercase letters from a-z, numbers 0-9, and specific symbols that are commonly allowed in email addresses (_ % + -)
// The + symbol means one or more occurrences of the previous pattern (in this case, the character set)
// The @ symbol simply needs to be matched as it appears in an email address
// The second character set is similar to the first, except it also allows periods (.) and does not allow certain symbols that are not allowed in domain names such as underscores and plus signs
// The \. means we are escaping the period, so it is treated as a literal character and not a regex symbol
// The {2,3} means we are expecting 2-3 characters matching the previous pattern, in this case lowercase letters from a-z
// This will match domain names such as .com, .net, .org, etc.
// By combining these patterns, we are able to match most standard email addresses in their proper format.
