//### Quantifiers ###
//{n}

//### Grouping and Alternation ###

//|
//Denotes alternation between different patterns

//### Character Escapes ###
//\ 
//Escapes a special character or turns a special character into a literal

//\d

//i
//Case-insensitive flag, ignores case when matching characters

//m
//Multiline flag, matches the beginning or end of each line separately

//### Examples ###
//Email validation
/^[A-Za-z\d]+[\w.-]*@[\w.-]*\.[a-z]{2,30}$/i

//Password validation
/(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[^a-zA-Z\d]).{8,}$/

//Phone number validation
/^[(]?(\d{3})?[-.]?(\d{3})[-.]?(\d{4})$/
