`/^\w+\.(com|net|org)(\/[a-z]+)*\/?$/i`
// This regular expression pattern matches any URL that starts with a word character, followed by a period, and ends with either .com, .net, or .org. The pattern also allows for optional subdirectories, indicated by the "\/" and any lowercase letters, indicated by the [a-z]+ group. The "\/?$" at the end of the pattern allows for an optional ending slash. The "i" at the end makes the pattern case-insensitive.
