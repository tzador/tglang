// This regex pattern checks for a valid email address in a case-insensitive manner.
// It matches one or more word characters at the beginning, followed by an optional dot and more word characters.
// Then an "@" symbol is required, followed by one or more letters for the domain.
// Finally, a period and 2-3 letters are required for the top-level domain.
// This pattern only matches strings that completely fit the email address format and does not extract specific parts of the email address.
