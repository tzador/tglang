- The first forward slash indicates the start of the regular expression.

- The caret symbol ^ indicates the start of the string we want to match.
- The positive lookahead, (?=.*?[A-Z]), ensures that the password contains at least one uppercase letter.
- The positive lookahead, (?=.*?[a-z]), ensures that the password contains at least one lowercase letter.
- The positive lookahead, (?=.*?[0-9]), ensures that the password contains at least one number.
- The positive lookahead, (?=.*?\W), ensures that the password contains at least one non-alphanumeric character.
- The dot . matches any character.
- The curly braces {12,20} specify the minimum and maximum number of characters allowed in the password.
