/^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])(?!.*\s).{8,}$/

//This regex pattern checks for a strong password, which must contain at least one digit, one lowercase and one uppercase letter, one special character and must be at least 8 characters long. It also ensures that there are no whitespace characters in the password.

//Regex breakdown:
/^                  // Denotes the start of the regex pattern
(?=.*\d)            // Lookahead assertion to check for at least one digit
(?=.*[a-z])         // Lookahead assertion to check for at least one lowercase letter
(?=.*[A-Z])         // Lookahead assertion to check for at least one uppercase letter
(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])    // Lookahead assertion to check for at least one special character
(?!.*\s)            // Negative lookahead assertion to ensure there are no whitespace characters
.{8,}               // Matches any character (except newline) 8 or more times
$/                  // Denotes the end of the regex pattern
