/(?<=([A-Z])[a-z]+\s)([A-Z][a-z]+)/g

This regular expression checks for two words separated by a space, where the first word starts with a capital letter and the second word starts with a capital letter followed by lowercase letters. It uses a positive lookbehind to check for the first capital letter and a positive lookahead to check for the second capital letter followed by lowercase letters. It also uses the global flag 'g' to match all occurrences in a string.
