/^[a-zA-Z][\w\-\.]+@[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-z]{2,3}$/
//This regex is used to validate email addresses
//Explanation:
// ^ - matches the start of the string
// [a-zA-Z] - matches any one lowercase or uppercase letter
// [\w\-\.]+ - matches one or more word characters, hyphens, or periods
// @ - matches the literal symbol '@'
// [a-zA-Z]+ - matches one or more lowercase or uppercase letters
// \. - matches the literal period symbol
// [a-z]{2,3} - matches two or three lowercase letters
// $ - matches the end of the string
// So, this regex ensures that the email address starts with a letter, has a word character or symbol, followed by an '@' symbol, then another set of letters, and ends with a period and two or three more letters, which would typically denote the domain extension.
