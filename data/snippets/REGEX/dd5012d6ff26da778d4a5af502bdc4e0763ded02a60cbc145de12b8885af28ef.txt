/^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[@#%^&+=])(?=\S+$).{8,}$/

Matches a string with at least:
- One lowercase letter
- One uppercase letter
- One number
- One special character (@, #, %, ^, &, +, =)
- Minimum of 8 characters without whitespaces

Explanation:
^                     - Indicates the start of the string
(?=.*[0-9])           - Positive lookahead to check for at least one number
(?=.*[a-z])           - Positive lookahead to check for at least one lowercase letter 
(?=.*[A-Z])           - Positive lookahead to check for at least one uppercase letter 
(?=.*[@#%^&+=])       - Positive lookahead to check for at least one special character 
(?=\S+$)              - Positive lookahead to check for no whitespaces in the entire string 
.{8,}                 - Matches any character at least 8 times
$                     - Indicates the end of the string

Example: 
"Pa$$w0rd!"           - This matches the regex and is considered a strong password. 
"pa$$word123"         - This does not match the regex and would not be considered a strong password. 

(Note: This is a simplified example of a password strength regex and may not cover all possible password requirements.)
