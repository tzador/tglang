^[a-z]+[- ]?[a-z]+?$

Explanation:
- `^` - signifies the start of the string
- `[a-z]+` - matches any sequence of one or more lowercase letters
- `[- ]?` - matches a single hyphen or space character 0 or 1 times
- `[a-z]+?` - matches any sequence of one or more lowercase letters, but the match is non-greedy, meaning it will only match as much as necessary
- `?` - signifies the end of the string and makes the hyphen and space character optional

This regex would be useful for validating names with the following criteria:
- Must start with one or more lowercase letters
- Can have a hyphen or space character, but not at the beginning or end
- Must end with one or more lowercase letters
