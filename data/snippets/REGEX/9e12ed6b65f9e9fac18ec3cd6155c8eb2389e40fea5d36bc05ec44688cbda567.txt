//The below regex will match any string that starts with "hello" and ends with "world"
"^hello.*world$"
//Flags can be added after the second slash to modify the behavior of the regex, such as ignoring case or allowing for multiline matching
"^hello.*world$/gi"
//Character classes can be used to specify patterns for certain groups of characters
"[A-Za-z]{5,10}" //will match any string of 5-10 letters, upper or lower case
"\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}" //will match phone numbers in the format of 123-456-7890
//Quantifiers can be added to specify how many times a specific character or group should be matched
"[A-Z]{3,5}" //will match 3-5 uppercase letters in a row
"\w{2,}\s\w{2,}\s\d{4}" //will match a name and birth date in the format of Firstname Lastname YYYY
//Groups can be used to capture specific parts of the matched string for later use
"(w)(123)\d{3}" //will capture the letters "w" and "123" and match any following 3 digits
//Alternation can be used to provide multiple options for the regex to match
"(red|blue|green)" //will match either the words "red", "blue" or "green"
//Anchors can be used to specify where in the string the match should occur
"^\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}$" //will only match phone numbers in the format of 123-456-7890 at the very beginning and end of the string
