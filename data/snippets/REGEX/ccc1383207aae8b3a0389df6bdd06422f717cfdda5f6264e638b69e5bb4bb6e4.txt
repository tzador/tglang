/((?<=Mr\.|Mrs\.|Dr\.)(\s[A-Z][a-z]+\s[A-Z][a-z]+)+)/g

// This regex pattern matches the name of a person with a title (Mr., Mrs., Dr.) followed by their first and last name. 
// It uses positive lookbehind (?<=) to check for the presence of the title before the name, and then captures the full name with the first and last name being any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.
// The g flag at the end ensures that all possible matches are found.
