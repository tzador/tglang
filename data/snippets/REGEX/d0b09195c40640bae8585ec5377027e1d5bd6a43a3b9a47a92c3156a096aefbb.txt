/^\s*((\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3})|([0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}(:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}){7}))\s*$/

// Explanation: This regex validates an IPv4 or IPv6 address. It checks for either 4 groups of 1-3 digits separated by periods or 8 groups of 1-4 hexadecimal digits separated by colons. The '^' and '$' at the beginning and end ensure that the entire string is validated. The '\s*' allows for any number of whitespace characters before and after the address.
