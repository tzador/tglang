(?<=\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}(?:,(?=\s|$)|\.))\d{3}(?<!000|666)[ -]?\d{2}[ -]?\d{4}(?:x\d+)?  


This code snippet is a regex pattern that matches valid Social Security Numbers (SSNs) in various formats. It uses positive lookbehind and negative lookbehind assertions to ensure that the SSN is preceded by a valid pattern and not a repeated or commonly used SSN.

Regex Explanation:
- (?<=\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}(?:,(?=\s|$)|\.)): positive lookbehind assertion that checks for a preceding valid pattern of three digits, followed by a hyphen, two digits, another hyphen, and four digits. This is then followed by either a comma and a whitespace character, or a period.
- \d{3}: matches three digits, representing the first part of the SSN.
- (?<!000|666): negative lookbehind assertion that ensures the first part of the SSN is not 000 or 666, which are commonly used as placeholders.
- [ -]?: optional matching of a space or hyphen character.
- \d{2}: matches two digits, representing the second part of the SSN.
- [ -]?: optional matching of a space or hyphen character.
- \d{4}: matches four digits, representing the third part of the SSN.
- (?:x\d+)?: optional non-capturing group that represents an "x" character followed by one or more digits, used for extended SSN formats.
- The regex pattern is global, meaning it will match all valid SSNs within a string.

Sample Input: "My SSN is 123-45*6789."
Sample Output: "123-456-7896"
