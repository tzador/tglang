(?<=\d{2}) (?:january|jan|february|feb|march|mar|april|apr|may|june|jun|july|jul|august|aug|september|sep|october|oct|november|nov|december|dec) (?:\d{2})?=
The above regex pattern extracts the month in a two-digit format from a date string, specified in the format "dd month yy" or "dd month yy".
It uses a positive lookbehind to match a two-digit number preceded by a space. After the space, it matches one of the specified month names in a non-capturing group. Lastly, it uses a lazy quantifier to match any remaining two digits after the month. The equals sign at the end is used to make the match conditional, so the regex only captures the desired output without any additional characters.
