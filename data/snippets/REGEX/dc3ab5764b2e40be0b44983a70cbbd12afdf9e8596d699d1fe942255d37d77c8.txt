# Regex to validate a strong password

/^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])[A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*]{8,16}$/
 
# Explanation:
# This regex requires a password to meet the following requirements:
# - Use at least one uppercase letter
# - Use at least one lowercase letter
# - Use at least one number
# - Use at least one special character from the following: !@#$%^&*
# - Be between 8 and 16 characters in length
# The '^' at the beginning and '$' at the end ensure that the whole string is matched and not just a part of it.
# The '?=' is a positive lookahead assertion which specifies that the pattern must be followed by the specified criteria.
# The '[A-Z]' matches any uppercase letter, '[a-z]' matches any lowercase letter, '[0-9]' matches any number, and '[!@#$%^&*]' matches any of the listed special characters.
# The '[A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*]' matches any alphanumeric character and special character.
# The '{8,16}' specifies minimum and maximum number of characters allowed.
# This regex will return a match if password satisfies all the criteria, otherwise it will return no match.
