/^(?<first_name>[A-Z][a-z]+) (?<last_name>[A-Z][a-z]+)$/

This regex pattern will match a string that contains a first and last name, separated by a space. The first and last name must start with an uppercase letter, followed by one or more lowercase letters.

Explanation:

- `^` matches the beginning of the string.
- `(?<first_name>[A-Z][a-z]+)` captures the first name in a named group called "first_name". The first name must start with an uppercase letter and can be followed by one or more lowercase letters.
- ` ` matches a space between the first and last name.
- `(?<last_name>[A-Z][a-z]+)` captures the last name in a named group called "last_name". The last name must start with an uppercase letter and can be followed by one or more lowercase letters.
- `$` matches the end of the string.

Example:
Input string: "John Doe"
Match result: "first_name" = "John", "last_name" = "Doe"

Input string: "Jane Smith"
Match result: "first_name" = "Jane", "last_name" = "Smith"
