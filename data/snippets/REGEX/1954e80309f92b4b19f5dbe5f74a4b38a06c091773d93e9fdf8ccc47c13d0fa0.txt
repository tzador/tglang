/^([A-Z]{1,2}|[a-z]{1,3})(?= ?)[ \t]*(\d{1,2})[ \t]*(?!(5|[0-5]{2})[A-a])([a-d]{1})(?!(1|[0-1]{2})[A-a])?([b-d]|[0-5]|[i-k]+)$/g

Description:
This regular expression matches a string that starts with either 1 or 2 uppercase letters or 1-3 lowercase letters, followed by 0 or 1 whitespace characters, followed by 1 or 2 digits, then 0 or more whitespace characters, followed by a letter between a-d but not after 5a or 5A, and finally followed by either a letter between b-d, a digit between 0-5, or one or more lowercase letters in the range i-k. The 'g' at the end signifies global matching, meaning it will match all occurrences of this pattern within a given string.

Example:
"A12b" --> Match
"a 15c" --> Match
"A2d   Fgijk" --> Match
"B10a" --> No match (after the 5, there is a letter 'A')
"1c" --> No match (doesn't start with a capital or lowercase letter)
"K3d" --> No match (first letter is out of range)
