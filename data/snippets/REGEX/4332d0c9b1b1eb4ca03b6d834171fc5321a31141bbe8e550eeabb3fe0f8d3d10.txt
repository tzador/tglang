^(?!\d*$)(([a-z*])(\w+)(\s*\w*)*)\3$
/* ----
 This regex matches a string that starts with a lowercase letter followed by one or more word characters, 
 and then potentially followed by a space and another word. It also checks that the string does not consist only of numbers.
 
 Here is a breakdown of the pattern:
 ^           - asserts the start of the string
 (?!         - negative lookahead to check the following condition
   \d*$      - string consisting of only digits
 )           - end of negative lookahead
 (           - start of first capturing group (\3 refers to this group)
   (         - start of second capturing group (\1 refers to this group)
     [a-z]     - a lowercase letter
     *         - match zero or more occurrences of the preceding character
   )           - end of second capturing group
   (\w+)       - one or more word characters
   (           - start of third capturing group
     \s*       - zero or more occurrences of whitespace character
     \w*       - zero or more occurrences of word character
   )           - end of third capturing group
   *         - match zero or more occurrences of the preceding character
 )           - end of first capturing group
 \3          - refers back to the third capturing group (to ensure matching patterns are repeated)
 $           - asserts the end of the string
