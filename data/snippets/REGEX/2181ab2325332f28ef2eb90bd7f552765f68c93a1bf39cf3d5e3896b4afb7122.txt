^(?!([0-9A-Za-z\\s])+$)^([A-Za-z\\s]){1,3}\\d{1,2}



Explanation: This regular expression allows for only strings with a maximum of three alphabetic characters, followed by one or two digits.
 
- The `^` indicates that the string must begin with the specified expression.
- The `(?!([0-9A-Za-z\\s])+$)` is a negative lookahead, which ensures that the string does not solely consist of alphanumeric characters and spaces.
- The `([A-Za-z\\s]){1,3}` matches one to three alphabetic characters or spaces.
- The `\\d{1,2}` matches one or two digits.
- The `$` indicates the end of the string. 

This regular expression can be used for validating inputs such as postal codes or other alphanumeric codes with specific character and digit limitations.
