/\d{3}[-.]\d{3}[-.]\d{4}/

/* 
This regex pattern matches a phone number in the format of
###-###-####, ###.###.####, or ### ### ####. 
The \d meta-character matches any digit and the {3} quantifier specifies 
to look for three consecutive digits. The [-.] character class matches 
either a hyphen or period. The regex pattern uses grouping with parentheses 
to allow for either a hyphen or period between the three sets of digits. 
The / at the beginning and end specify the start and end of the regex pattern.
