/\b([a-z0-9._%+-]+)@([a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4})\b/
// Explanation: This regex pattern matches email addresses that follow the standard format of username@domain.
[a-z0-9._%+-]+ // matches one or more lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, periods, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens
@ // matches the "@" symbol
([a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4}) // matches the domain name, which consists of one or more lowercase letters, numbers, periods, or hyphens, followed by a period and a top-level domain of 2-4 characters
\b // matches a word boundary, ensuring that the entire email address is matched and not just a portion of it.
