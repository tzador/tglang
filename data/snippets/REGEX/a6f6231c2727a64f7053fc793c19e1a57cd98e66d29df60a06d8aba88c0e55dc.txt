// This regex pattern checks for a strong password that must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. 
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$
// Explanation:
// ^ = start of string
// (?=.*[a-z]) = positive lookahead assertion that checks for at least one lowercase letter
// (?=.*[A-Z]) = positive lookahead assertion that checks for at least one uppercase letter
// (?=.*\d) = positive lookahead assertion that checks for at least one number
// (?=.*[@$!%*?&]) = positive lookahead assertion that checks for at least one special character
// [A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&] = character set containing all possible characters for the password
// {8,} = at least 8 characters long
// $ = end of string
