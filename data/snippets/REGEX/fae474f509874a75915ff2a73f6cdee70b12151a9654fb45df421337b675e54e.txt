(?:^|[A-Z]{2})\d{5,8}$

This regex code snippet matches a 5 to 8 digit number that is preceded by either the start of a string or two consecutive uppercase letters. The ?: at the beginning signifies that this is a non-capturing group, meaning it will not be included in the final match. This is followed by the ^ character, which matches the start of a string. The [A-Z]{2} portion matches exactly two consecutive uppercase letters. Afterwards, the \d{5,8} portion matches any 5 to 8 digits. The $ character signifies the end of the string, ensuring that the digits are the only characters in the match. This regex can be used to verify that a given input is a valid ID number for a specific format.
