// This regex will validate an email address format
^(?!\\.)[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]+$ 
/*
Explanation: 
- The caret (^) at the beginning signifies the start of the string.
- The negative lookahead (?!\\.) checks for a dot at the beginning to avoid email addresses starting with a dot.
- The character set [a-zA-Z0-9_.-] matches one or more alphanumeric characters, periods, underscores, and hyphens.
- The plus sign (+) ensures that there must be at least one character in the character set.
- The @ symbol is a literal representation of itself.
- The second character set [a-zA-Z0-9-] matches one or more alphanumeric characters and hyphens for the domain name.
- The backslash before the dot (\\.) is an escape character, as the dot is a special character in regex.
- The second backslash (\\) before the dot is needed to escape the first backslash in the regex string.
- The backslash before the dot and the second backslash act as a literal representation of the dot character.
- The plus sign (+) after the second character set ensures that there must be at least one character in the domain name.
- The third character set [a-zA-Z] matches one or more alphabetical characters for the top-level domain.
- The dollar sign ($) signifies the end of the string.
