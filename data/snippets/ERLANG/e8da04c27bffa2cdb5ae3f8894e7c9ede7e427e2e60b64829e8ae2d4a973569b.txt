% This is a complex function in ERLANG that takes in a list of numbers and outputs the sum of the squares of the numbers.

-module(math).
-export([sum_of_squares/1]).

% Function that takes in a list of numbers and uses recursion to calculate the sum of the squares.
sum_of_squares([]) -> 
    0;
sum_of_squares([Num | Rest]) ->
    % Square the current number
    Square = Num * Num,
    % Recursively call the function on the rest of the list
    sum_of_squares(Rest),
    % Add the squared number to the result of the recursive call
    Result = Square + sum_of_squares(Rest),
    % Return the result
    Result.
    
% Example function call
math:sum_of_squares([1,2,3,4]).
% Output: 30
