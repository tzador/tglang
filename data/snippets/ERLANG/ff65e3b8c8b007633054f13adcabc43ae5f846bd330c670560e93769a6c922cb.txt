%% Definition of a function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number

%% Function definition with pattern matching for base case (factorial of 0 is 1)
factorial(0) -> 1;

%% Function definition with recursion for calculating factorial of a number greater than 0
factorial(N) -> N * factorial(N-1).

%% Definition of a function `fibonacci` that calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence

%% Function definition with pattern matching for first two terms of the sequence (1 and 1)
fibonacci(1) -> 1;
fibonacci(2) -> 1;

%% Function definition with recursion for calculating the nth term of the sequence
fibonacci(N) -> fibonacci(N-1) + fibonacci(N-2).
