%% Function to calculate factorial of a number
%% Takes in input as integer and returns the factorial
factorial(N) ->
    case N of 
        0 -> 1; % Base case, factorial of 0 is 1
        1 -> 1; % Base case, factorial of 1 is 1
        _ -> N * factorial(N-1) % Recursive call to calculate factorial
    end.
