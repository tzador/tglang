%% This is a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using tail recursion
%% It takes in a parameter 'n' which is the nth number to be calculated
%% and two accumulator parameters that keep track of the previous numbers in the sequence

fibonacci(n, Result, _) ->
  %% If n is 0, return the current result
  if n == 0 -> Result;

  %% If n is 1 or 2, return 1 as the result
  n == 1 or n == 2 -> 1;

  %% If n is greater than 2, recursively call the function with updated parameters
  %% The updated result is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence
  true -> fibonacci(n-1, Result+Result1, Result1)
end.

%% To call the function, pass in the value of n as the first parameter and 0 and 1 as the accumulator parameters
fibonacci(n, 0, 1).
