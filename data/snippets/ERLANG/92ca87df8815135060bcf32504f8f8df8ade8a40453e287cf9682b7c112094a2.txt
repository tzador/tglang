% Function that calculates the factorial of a number
fact(N) ->
    % Call helper function with initial accumulator value of 1
    fact_helper(N, 1).

% Helper function that iterates through all numbers from N to 1
fact_helper(0, Acc) ->
    % Base case: return accumulator value
    Acc;
% Recursive case: multiply current number by accumulator and call helper function with next number and updated accumulator
fact_helper(N, Acc) ->
    fact_helper(N-1, N*Acc).
