%% Create a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.
%% The function takes in a list as the parameter and returns the average as the output.

%% Define the function with one parameter, 'List'
average(List) -> 
    %% Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list using the 'lists' module and the 'sum' function.
    Sum = lists:sum(List), 
    %% Get the length of the list using the 'length' function.
    Length = length(List), 
    %% Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length.
    Average = Sum / Length, 
    %% Return the average as the output.
    Average.
