-module(example).

%% This is a module declaration in ERLANG

-export([sum/2, fib/1]).
%% This line exports the functions sum/2 and fib/1

-spec sum(number(), number()) -> number().
%% This line specifies the types of the arguments and return value for the function sum

sum(A, B) ->
%% This is the start of the function sum
    A + B.
%% This is the body of the function sum, which calculates the sum of the two arguments

-spec fib(integer()) -> integer().
%% This line specifies the type of the argument and return value for the function fib

fib(0) -> 0;
%% This is the base case for the Fibonacci sequence, where the value of 0 is returned
fib(1) -> 1;
%% This is the second base case for the Fibonacci sequence, where the value of 1 is returned
fib(N) ->
%% This is the start of the function fib
    fib(N-1) + fib(N-2).
%% This is the recursive calculation for the Fibonacci sequence, where the function calls itself with N-1 and N-2 as arguments and adds the results together.
