%% A module for calculating the sum of two numbers

-module(sum).

%% Export the functions sum/2, diff/2, and multiply/2
-export([sum/2, diff/2, multiply/2]).

%% Define the sum function that takes two numbers and returns their sum
sum(A, B) ->
  A + B.

%% Define the difference function that takes two numbers and returns their difference
diff(A, B) ->
  A - B.

%% Define the multiply function that takes two numbers and returns their product
multiply(A, B) ->
  A * B.
