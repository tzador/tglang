%% A simple recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number
%% @param Num integer value to calculate the factorial of
%% @returns factorial integer value
fact(Num) ->

        0 -> 1;            %% base case, factorial of 0 is 1
        1 -> 1;            %% base case, factorial of 1 is 1
        _ -> Num * fact(Num - 1)     %% recursive call, decreases Num by 1 until Num reaches 0 or 1
