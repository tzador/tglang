%%% Define a module named 'example' 
-module(example). 

%%% Export functions additive and multiplicative 
-export([additive/2, multiplicative/2]). 

%%% Function to perform additive operation 
%%% Takes two numbers as input and adds them 
%%% Returns the result 
additive(A, B) -> 
    A + B. 

%%% Function to perform multiplicative operation 
%%% Takes two numbers as input and multiplies them 
%%% Returns the result 
multiplicative(A, B) -> 
    A * B. 

%%% Function to perform division operation 
%%% Takes two numbers as input and divides the first by the second 
%%% Returns the result 
division(A, B) -> 
    A / B.
