%% This module defines a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

-module(factorial).

-export([factorial/1]).

%% `factorial/1` takes one argument, `N`, and returns the factorial of `N`.
%% The factorial is calculated recursively using pattern matching and a helper function, `factorial_helper/2`.
%% If `N` is less than or equal to 1, the factorial is 1.
%% Otherwise, the factorial is calculated by multiplying `N` by the factorial of `N-1`.

factorial(N) ->
    if
        N =< 1 ->
            1;
        true ->
            N * factorial_helper(N-1, 1)
    end.

%% `factorial_helper/2` takes two arguments, `N` and `Acc`,
%% and recursively calculates the factorial using the accumulator `Acc`.
%% Once `N` reaches 1, the accumulator will contain the factorial,
%% which is then returned.

factorial_helper(1, Acc) ->
    Acc;
factorial_helper(N, Acc) ->
    factorial_helper(N-1, N*Acc).
