%% This code snippet demonstrates a function for calculating the factorial of a given number.
 
-module(factorial).
-export([factorial/1]).
 
% A helper function for calculating the factorial.
% Takes in a number n and a result accumulator.
% Returns the factorial of n.
factorial_helper(0, Acc) ->
    Acc; % Base case, when n is 0, return accumulator.
factorial_helper(N, Acc) ->
    factorial_helper(N - 1, N * Acc). % Recursive case, decrement N and multiply by accumulator.
 
% The main function for calculating the factorial.
% Takes in a number and calls factorial_helper with n and initial accumulator of 1.
factorial(N) ->
    factorial_helper(N, 1).
