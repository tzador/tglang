%% This code snippet creates a function that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean of the numbers.
mean(List) ->
  %%Getting the sum of all numbers in the list
  Sum = lists:foldl(fun(X, Acc) -> X + Acc end, 0, List),
  %%Calculating the length of the list
  Len = length(List),
  %%Dividing the sum by the length to get the mean
  Sum / Len.
