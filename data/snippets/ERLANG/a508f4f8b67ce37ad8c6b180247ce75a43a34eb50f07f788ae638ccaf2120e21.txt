%% Function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion
%% Takes in an integer and returns its factorial

factorial(N) ->
    if
        N =< 0 -> 1;  %% Base case for factorial function, stop when N is 0 or less
        true -> N * factorial(N-1) %% Recursive call to factorial function
    end.
