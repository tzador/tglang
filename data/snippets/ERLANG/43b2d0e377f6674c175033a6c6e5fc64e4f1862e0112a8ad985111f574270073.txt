%% Define a function that takes in two integers and returns their sum.
add(X, Y) ->
    X + Y.
    
%% Define a list of tuples containing names and ages.
People = [{Jane, 25}, {John, 30}, {Alice, 22}].

%% Loop through the list and print out the name and age of each person.
%% In ERLANG, recursion is used for looping.
print_tuples([]) -> ok; % Base case
print_tuples([{Name, Age} | T]) ->
    io:format("Name: ~s, Age: ~w~n", [Name, Age]), % Print out the name and age
    print_tuples(T). % Recursive call to loop through the rest of the list

%% Call the function and print out the sum of two numbers.
Sum = add(3, 5),
io:format("The sum is ~w~n", [Sum]).

%% Output:
%% Name: Jane, Age: 25
%% Name: John, Age: 30
%% Name: Alice, Age: 22
%% The sum is 8
