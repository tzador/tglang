%% This function calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence using tail recursion
%% Input: n - the term to be computed
%% Output: the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
%% Example: fib(5) will return 5 (the 5th term of the sequence is 5)
fib(N) ->
    fib(N, 0, 1).

%% This helper function implements the logic of the tail recursive call
%% Input: n - the term to be computed
%%        a - the first term of the sequence
%%        b - the second term of the sequence
%% Output: the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
