% A function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence to a given limit
% Parameters:
% - Limit: The highest number in the Fibonacci sequence to be calculated
% - Current: The current number in the sequence being calculated
% - Previous: The previous number in the sequence (by default set to 0)
% - Result: A list containing the calculated sequence 
fib(Limit, Limit, _, [Limit]) -> [Limit];
fib(Limit, Current, Previous, Result) ->
    % Check if current number is below limit
    case Current < Limit of
        true ->
            % Calculate next number in sequence
            Next = Current + Previous,
            
            % Add current number to result list
            NewResult = [Current | Result],
            
            % Recursive call to calculate next number
            fib(Limit, Next, Current, NewResult);
        false -> Result
    end.
