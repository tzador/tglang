%% The following ERLANG code snippet takes in a list of numbers and prints out the sum of the numbers

-module(sum).

%% Public function that takes in a list of numbers, calculates the sum and calls the private function
%% @param List, list of numbers to be summed up
%% @return the sum of the numbers
sum(List) ->

    io:format("The sum is ~p~n", [Sum]).

%% Private function that recursively calculates the sum of the numbers in the list
%% @param List, list of numbers to be summed up
%% @param Acc, accumulator that keeps track of the running sum
%% @return the final sum of the numbers
sum([], Acc) ->
    Acc;
sum([H|T], Acc) ->
    sum(T, H + Acc).
