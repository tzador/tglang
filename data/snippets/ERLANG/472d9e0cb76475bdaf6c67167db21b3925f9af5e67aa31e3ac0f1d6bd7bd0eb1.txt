%% This code snippet uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number

%% Function for calculating the factorial
fact(N) ->
    %% Base case - if number is 0, factorial is 1
    if N == 0 ->
        1; 
    %% Recursive case - call the function again with N-1, and multiply by N
    true ->
        fact(N-1) * N 
    end.

%% Function for printing the result
print(F) ->
    %% Print the factorial with a message
    io:format("The factorial of ~p is ~p", [F, fact(F)]).

%% Call the print function with any number
print(5). %% Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
