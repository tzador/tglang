%%% Annotated ERLANG code snippet
-module(example).  %%% Declares the name of the module
-export([factorial/1]). %%% The 'factorial' function will be exported for use outside the module

%%% Function that calculates the factorial of a given number
factorial(0) -> 1; %%% Base case when the number is 0, factorial is 1
factorial(N) when N > 0 -> N * factorial(N-1). %%% Recursive case, multiplies the number with the factorial of the number 1 less than it

%%% Examples to test the factorial function
factorial_test() ->
    10 = factorial(5), %%% Tests if the factorial of 5 is equal to 10
    720 = factorial(6). %%% Tests if the factorial of 6 is equal to 720
