% Example of a function that finds the minimum value in a list
findMin(List) ->
    case List of
        [Head|Tail] ->
            % Use `lists:min/1` to find minimum value in list
            Min = lists:min(Tail),
            if
                Head < Min ->
                    % Head is smaller, so it is the new minimum
                    findMin(Tail);
                true ->
                    % Head is larger, so the current minimum remains
                    findMin(Tail, Min)
            end;

        [] ->
            % Empty list, return 0 as minimum
            0
    end.
