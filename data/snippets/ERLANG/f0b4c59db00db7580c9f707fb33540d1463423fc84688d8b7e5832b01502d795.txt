%% Defines a function that takes in two integers and returns their sum.
sum(A, B) ->
    %% Uses pattern matching to determine base case.
    (A, 0) -> A;
    (0, B) -> B;
    (A, B) -> 
        %% If neither integer is 0, recursively calls the function with 
        %% one less than the first integer and one less than the second integer,
        %% then adds them together.
        sum(A-1, B-1) + 2.
