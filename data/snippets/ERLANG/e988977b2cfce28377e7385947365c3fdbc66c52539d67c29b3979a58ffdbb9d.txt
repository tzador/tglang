%% The example_module module defines the function 'fibonacci', which calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence.

%% The fibonacci function takes in one argument 'n', which represents the position of the term to be calculated in the sequence.
%% The function returns the calculated value using pattern matching and recursion.
fibonacci(0) -> 0; %% Base case for the first term in the sequence, which is 0.
fibonacci(1) -> 1; %% Base case for the second term in the sequence, which is 1.
fibonacci(N) -> fibonacci(N-1) + fibonacci(N-2). %% Recursive call to calculate the nth term by adding the previous two terms in the sequence.
