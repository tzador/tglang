%% This code snippet creates a module with functions for calculating and printing the Fibonacci sequence

-module(fibonacci).

%% Function that calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
%% Takes in an integer input and returns the calculated term
%% Uses recursion to efficiently calculate the sequence
fib(0) -> 0;
fib(1) -> 1;
fib(N) when N > 1 ->
    fib(N-1) + fib(N-2).

%% Function that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term
%% Takes in an integer input and prints each term on a new line
%% Uses the fib function to calculate each term
print_fib(N) ->
    [io:format("~p~n", [fib(I)]) || I <- lists:seq(0, N)].

%% Function that runs the program by taking in user input and calling the print function
run() ->
    io:format("Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: "),
    {ok, [N]} = io:fread(""),
    print_fib(N).
