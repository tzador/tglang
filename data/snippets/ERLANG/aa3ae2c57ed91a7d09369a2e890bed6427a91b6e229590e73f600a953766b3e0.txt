-module(example).
% This is a module declaration in ERLANG.

-export([fib/1]).
% This exports the function 'fib' with one parameter.

fib(0) ->
	1;
% This is the base case where 0 is passed in.

fib(1) ->
	1;
% This is the second base case where 1 is passed in.

fib(N) when N > 1 ->
	fib(N-1) + fib(N-2).
% This is the recursive case where N is greater than 1 and it calls the function 'fib' with the previous two values.
