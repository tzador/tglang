%% This is a module named math_ops
-module(math_ops).

%% Importing the erlang standard library module
-import lists.

%% Defining a function named sum that takes in two integers and returns their sum
sum(Int1, Int2) ->
    Int1 + Int2.

%% Defining a function that multiplies a list of integers by a factor of 2
multiply_list(List) ->
    [2 * X || X <- List].

%% Defining a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial(0) ->
    1;
factorial(N) ->
    N * factorial(N - 1).

%% Defining a function that finds the maximum of two integers
find_max(Int1, Int2) ->
    if Int1 > Int2 ->
        Int1;
    true ->
        Int2
    end.

%% Defining a record to represent a student
-record(student, {name, age, major, gpa}).

%% Creating an example student
Joe = #student{name = "Joe", age = 20, major = "Computer Science", gpa = 3.7}.

%% Printing the information of the student
io:format("Name: ~s, Age: ~B, Major: ~s, GPA: ~.2f", [Joe#student.name, Joe#student.age, Joe#student.major, Joe#student.gpa]).
