% This is a function that takes in a list and recursively finds the average of its elements
my_function(List) ->

    % Calculate the sum of the list
    Sum = lists:sum(List),

    % Calculate the length of the list
    Length = length(List),

    % Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length
    Average = Sum / Length,

    % Return the average
    Average.

/* Example usage
my_module:my_function([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). % Output: 3 */
