-module(example).
%% This is a module declaration in ERLANG.

-export([factorial/1]).
%% This exports the factorial/1 function from the example module.

factorial(0) -> 1;
%% If the input is 0, the output is 1.
factorial(N) when N > 0 ->
%% If the input is greater than 0, the following conditions are checked.
    N * factorial(N-1).
%% If the input is greater than 0, the output is N multiplied by the factorial of N-1.

%% This is a recursive function that computes the factorial of a given input.

%% To use the factorial function, call it with the module name and input as parameters.
%% For example, to compute factorial of 5, you can call it as - example:factorial(5).
