-module(math). %% Defines a module named 'math'
-compile(export_all). %% Imports all functions in the module
%% Function to calculate the factorial of a number
fact(0) -> 1; %% Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
fact(N) when N > 0 -> N * fact(N - 1); %% Recursive case: factorial of N is N multiplied by the factorial of N-1
fact(N) when N < 0 -> error; %% Error case: negative number not allowed
%% Function to calculate the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
fib(0) -> 0; %% Base case: first term in Fibonacci sequence is 0
fib(1) -> 1; %% Base case: second term in Fibonacci sequence is 1
fib(N) when N > 1 -> fib(N - 1) + fib(N - 2); %% Recursive case: nth term in Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous two terms
fib(N) when N < 0 -> error. %% Error case: negative term not allowed
