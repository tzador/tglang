%% A function for calculating the average of a list
-module(average).
-export([calculate/1]).

%% This function takes in a list of integers and calculates the average
calculate(List) ->
    %% Check if the list is empty, if so return 0
    case List of
        [] -> 0;
        %% If the list has one element, return that element
        [X] -> X;
        %% If the list has more than one element, sum all elements and divide by length
        _ -> Total = lists:sum(List),
            Length = length(List),
            Total / Length
    end.
