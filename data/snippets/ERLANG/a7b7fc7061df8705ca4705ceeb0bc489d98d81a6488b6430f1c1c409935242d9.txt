%% A function that calculates the factorial of a number

-module(factorial).
-export([factorial/1]).
%% Exporting the factorial function for use in other modules.

factorial(0) -> 
    1; 
%% Base case where the factorial of 0 is 1.

factorial(Number) -> 
    calculate_factorial(Number, 1).

%% Calculating the factorial using recursion.

calculate_factorial(1,Accumulator) -> 
    Accumulator; 
%% Base case where the accumulator is returned as the final result.

calculate_factorial(Number,Accumulator) when Number > 1 -> 
    calculate_factorial(Number - 1, Number * Accumulator).
%% Recursive case where the accumulator is continuously multiplied by the decreasing number until the base case is reached.

%% Example call: factorial:factorial(5).
%% Output: 120
