%% This is a function that calculates the greatest common divisor between two numbers in Erlang
%%% `gcd` takes in two integers `M` and `N` as arguments
%%% and returns their greatest common divisor as an integer
gcd(M, N) ->
    if
        M == 0 -> N;  %% if M is equal to 0, return N as the GCD
        N == 0 -> M;  %% if N is equal to 0, return M as the GCD
        true ->      %% otherwise, perform the recursive call with the remainder after dividing M by N
            gcd(N, M rem N)
    end. %% end of the function
