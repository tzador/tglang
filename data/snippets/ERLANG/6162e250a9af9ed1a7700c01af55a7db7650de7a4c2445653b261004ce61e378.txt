%% This is a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
fibonacci(N) ->
    fibonacci(N, 0, 1).

%% This is a recursive helper function.
%% It takes in three parameters - N, A and B - where N is the current number being calculated,
%% A and B are the two previous Fibonacci numbers.
fibonacci(0, A, _) ->
    A;
fibonacci(N, A, B) ->
    fibonacci(N-1, B, A+B).
