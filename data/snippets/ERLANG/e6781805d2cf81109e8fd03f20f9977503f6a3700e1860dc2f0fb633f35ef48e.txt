%% This function takes in two numbers and computes their greatest common divisor.

%% Function Definition
%% Parameters:
%% a - first number
%% b - second number
gcd(a, b) ->
    %% Base Case
    if
        a == b ->
            a;  %% return a if both numbers are equal
        b == 0 ->
            a;  %% return a if one number is 0
        a == 0 ->
            b;  %% return b if one number is 0
    %% Recursive Case
    true ->
        if
            a > b ->
                gcd(a-b, b);  %% recursively call gcd with difference of a and b
            true ->
                gcd(a, b-a);  %% recursively call gcd with difference of b and a
        end.
