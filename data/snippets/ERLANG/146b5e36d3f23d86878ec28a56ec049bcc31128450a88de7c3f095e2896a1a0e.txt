%%% This function computes the nth Fibonacci number using recursion
fibonacci(N) ->
    case N of 
        0 -> 0;                    %%% Base case: 0th Fibonacci number is 0
        1 -> 1;                    %%% Base case: 1st Fibonacci number is 1
        _ -> fibonacci(N-1) + fibonacci(N-2) %%% Recursive case: Compute the nth Fibonacci number by summing the previous two numbers
    end.
    
%%% Example usage
Output = fibonacci(10).            %%% Output: 55 (the 10th Fibonacci number)
