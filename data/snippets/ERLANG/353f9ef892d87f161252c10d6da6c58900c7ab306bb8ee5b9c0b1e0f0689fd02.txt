-module(math_functions).
% This module contains various math functions for
% performing calculations.

-export([add/2, subtract/2, multiply/2, divide/2]).

add(X, Y) ->
  X + Y. % This function takes two integers, X and Y, as arguments
  % and returns their sum.

subtract(X, Y) ->
  X - Y. % This function takes two integers, X and Y, as arguments
  % and returns their difference.

multiply(X, Y) ->
  X * Y. % This function takes two integers, X and Y, as arguments
  % and returns their product.

divide(X, Y) ->
  case Y of
    0 -> % If the second argument is 0, return an error
      {error, divide_by_zero};
    _ ->  % Otherwise, return the result of the division
      X / Y
  end. % This function takes two integers, X and Y, as arguments
  % and returns their quotient, unless Y is 0.
