%% Defines a module called `math_functions`.
-module(math_functions).

%% Exports the `add/2` and `subtract/2` functions.
-export([add/2, subtract/2]).

%% Specifies the `add/2` function, which takes two numbers and returns their sum.
add(X, Y) ->
    X + Y.

%% Specifies the `subtract/2` function, which takes two numbers and returns the difference between them.
subtract(X, Y) ->
    X - Y.

%% Defines a private function called `randomize/1` which takes in a list and returns the elements in a random order.
randomize(List) ->
    randomize(List, []).

%% Uses tail recursion to shuffle the elements of the given list into a new list.
randomize([], Acc) ->
    Acc;
randomize(List, Acc) ->
    RandomIndex = random:uniform(length(List)),
    Element = lists:nth(RandomIndex, List),
    NewList = lists:delete(RandomIndex, List),
    randomize(NewList, [Element | Acc]).
