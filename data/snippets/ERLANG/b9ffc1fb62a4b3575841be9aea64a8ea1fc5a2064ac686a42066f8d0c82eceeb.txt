%% Defines a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

fac(0) -> 1; % base case, factorial of 0 is 1
fac(N) when N > 0 -> % recursive case, N needs to be a positive integer
  N * fac(N-1). % calls the fac function again, with N-1 as the argument

%% Example call to the function, calculates the factorial of 5
fac(5).
