%% Function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion
-module(factorial).
-export([factorial/1]).

%% The function takes a single integer as input
%% and returns its factorial as an integer
factorial(N) ->
    %% Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    case N of
        0 -> 1;

        %% Recursive step: multiply N with factorial of N-1
        _ -> N * factorial(N-1)
    end.
