% This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number
% Factorials can only be calculated for positive integers

% The function takes in one parameter, Num, which is the number whose factorial is to be calculated
factorial(Num) when Num > 0 ->

    % A base case where the factorial of 0 is 1
    factorial(0) ->
        1;

    % A recursive call to calculate the factorial of a number
    factorial(Num) ->
        Num * factorial(Num - 1).
