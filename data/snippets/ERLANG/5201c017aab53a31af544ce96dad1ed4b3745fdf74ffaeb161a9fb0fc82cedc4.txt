-record(state, {data, count}).
%%This creates a record called "state" with two fields, "data" and "count"

sum(State) ->
    case State#state.data of
        [] -> 0;
        [H|T] -> H + sum(State#state{data = T})
    end.
%%This function takes in an instance of the state record and calculates the sum of the "data" field by recursively adding the head (H) to the sum of the tail (T) of the data list.

start() ->
    State = #state{data = [1, 2, 3], count = 1},
    NewCount = State#state.count + 1,
    NewState = State#state{count = NewCount},
    NewState.
%%This function initializes a new instance of the state record with a starting data list of [1, 2, 3] and a count of 1. It then increments the count by 1 and returns the updated state.

main() ->
    State = start(),
    Sum = sum(State),
    io:format("The sum of the data list is ~p.", [Sum]).
%%This is the main function that calls the "start" function to initialize the state, calculates the sum using the "sum" function, and prints the result using the io:format function.
