%%# This is a complex function that takes in a list of integers as input and checks if the sum of all numbers in the list is an even number. If it is even, it returns the list in reverse order. If it is odd, it returns an empty list.
%%# Example input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
%%# Example output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

%%# Define the function named 'check_sum'
check_sum(List) ->
    %%# Call the 'lists' module to sum all elements in the list
    Sum = lists:sum(List),
    %%# Use the modulo operator to check if the sum is even
    case Sum rem 2 of
        0 ->
            %%# If the sum is even, reverse the list using the 'lists' module
            lists:reverse(List);
        _ ->
            %%# If the sum is odd, return an empty list
            []
    end.
