%% Function for calculating the factorial of a number
%% Takes in a number as an argument and returns the factorial

factorial(N) ->

    %% Base case: if number is 0, return 1
    if N == 0 ->
        1;

    %% Recursive case: calculate factorial of N-1 and multiply it by N
    true ->
        factorial(N-1) * N
    end.

%% example call with N=5
factorial(5).
