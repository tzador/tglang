%%% This is a module that implements a basic TCP server in Erlang %%%

-module(tcp_server).

%%% Imports the necessary Erlang libraries %%%

-compile(export_all).
-define(PORT, 8000).

%%% Starts the server by calling the 'start' function %%%

    {ok, ListenSocket} = gen_tcp:listen(?PORT, [binary, {active, false}, {packet, 0}]),

%%% Accepts incoming connections and spawns a new process to handle each connection %%%

%%% Handles a single connection %%%

%%% A function that performs some operation on the received command %%%

do_something(Command) ->

    {ok, Result}.

%%% A function that sends a response back to the client %%%
