%% Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
-factorial(0) -> 1; % Base case, factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N) when N > 0 ->             % If N is greater than 0, calculate factorial
    N * factorial(N-1).                % Recursive call to calculate factorial

%% Example of calling the factorial function
N = 5.        % Number whose factorial we want to calculate
Result = factorial(N).        % Call the factorial function and store result in variable Result

%% Output:
Result = 120.        % Output of factorial(5)
