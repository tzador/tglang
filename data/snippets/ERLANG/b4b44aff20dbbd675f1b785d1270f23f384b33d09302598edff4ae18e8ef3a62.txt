%% Defines a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
-module(factorial).

%% Export the function so it can be used outside of the module
-export([factorial/1]).

%% Function to calculate the factorial, takes in one argument which is a number
factorial(Number) ->
    % Check if the number is 0 and return 1, as the factorial of 0 is 1
    if Number =:= 0 ->
        1;
    % If it's not 0, recursively call the factorial function with the number - 1 and multiply it with the original number
    true ->
        Number * factorial(Number - 1)
    end.
