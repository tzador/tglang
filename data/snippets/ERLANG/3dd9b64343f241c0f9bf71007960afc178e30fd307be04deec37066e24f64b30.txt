%% This function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
%% Parameters:
%%     Num - the number whose factorial is to be calculated
%% Returns:
%%     The factorial of the given number

    if
        Num < 0 ->

            %% Factorial of 1 is also 1

            %% Calculate factorial using recursion
            Num * factorial(Num - 1)
