# This is a complex NGINX configuration snippet that includes multiple server blocks for different virtual hosts
# Each server block includes a listen directive to specify the port it should listen on, a server_name directive to specify the domain it should respond to, and a root directive to specify the root directory for the website files

server { # First server block
  listen 80; # The server should listen on port 80
  server_name example.com; # The server should respond to requests for example.com
  root /var/www/example.com; # The root directory for the website files
  location / { # The location block for the root directory
    index index.html; # The default file to serve
  }
}

server { # Second server block
  listen 80; # The server should listen on port 80
  server_name example.net; # The server should respond to requests for example.net
  root /var/www/example.net; # The root directory for the website files
  location / { # The location block for the root directory
    index index.php; # The default file to serve
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args; # A complex try_files directive to handle different file requests
  }
}

server { # Third server block
  listen 443 ssl; # The server should listen on port 443 with SSL enabled
  server_name secure.example.com; # The server should respond to requests for secure.example.com
  root /var/www/secure.example.com; # The root directory for the website files
  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/secure.example.com.crt; # The SSL certificate for the domain
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/secure.example.com.key; # The SSL certificate key for the domain
  location / { # The location block for the root directory
    index index.html; # The default file to serve
  }
