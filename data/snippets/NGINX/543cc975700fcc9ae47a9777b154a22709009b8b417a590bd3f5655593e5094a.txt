# Example server configuration

# The server directive tells NGINX to listen on port 80 for HTTP requests
server {
    # The listen directive listens on the specified port
    listen 80;

    # The server_name directive defines the domain name for the server
    server_name www.example.com;

    # The root directive sets the root directory for the server
    root /var/www/example;

    # The index directive defines the default file to be served if no file is specified in the URL
    index index.html;

    # The location directive defines rules for how to handle requests
    location / {
        # The try_files directive checks for files in the specified directory and serves the first one found
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # The location directive can be used to handle different types of requests
    location ~ \.php$ {
        # The fastcgi_pass directive specifies the location of the FastCGI server handling requests for this location
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock;

        # The fastcgi_param directive defines parameters to be passed to the FastCGI server
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
