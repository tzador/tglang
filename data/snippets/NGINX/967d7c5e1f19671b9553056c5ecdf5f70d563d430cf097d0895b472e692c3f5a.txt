# Explanation:
# This code snippet configures a virtual host using NGINX.
# It specifies that the server should listen on port 80 for both IPv4 and IPv6 connections.
# The server name is set to example.com and www.example.com.
# The root directory for the host is set to /var/www/example.com/public.
# The index file is set to index.html.
# The first location block specifies that for any request, NGINX should try to find a matching file in the specified directory,
# and if it cannot be found, it will return a 404 error.
# The second location block specifies that any request for a .php file should be passed to the FastCGI process listening on the specified socket.
# The fastcgi_params file is included, which contains the necessary parameters for executing PHP files.
# The index file for .php files is set to index.php.
# The SCRIPT_FILENAME parameter is set to the document root plus the requested file, allowing PHP to locate and execute the correct file.
