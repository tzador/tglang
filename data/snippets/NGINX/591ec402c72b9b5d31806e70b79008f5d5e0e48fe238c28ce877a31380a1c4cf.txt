# Explanation:
# This code snippet is meant to be used in an NGINX configuration file to serve a website and a corresponding API.
# The `server` block is the main configuration block, specifying the port to listen on and the server name.
# The `location` block sets the root directory and default index file for the main website.
# The second `location` block specifies the location of the API and proxies all requests to a backend server.
# The `proxy_set_header` lines set some additional headers for the proxy request.
# The `error_page` line specifies which page to show in case of a 404 error.
# Finally, the last `location` block is an internal redirect to a custom 404 error page.
