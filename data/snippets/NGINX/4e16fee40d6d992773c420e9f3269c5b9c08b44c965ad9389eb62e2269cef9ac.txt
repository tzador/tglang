# This is a long and complex code snippet in NGINX

# First, we define the server block
server {
    listen 80; # This is the port that the server will listen on
    server_name example.com; # This is the domain name that the server will respond to

    # Next, we define the location block
    location / {
        root /var/www/html; # This is the root directory for the server
        index index.html index.htm; # This specifies the default files to serve if no specific file is requested
    }

    # Now, we create a location block to handle requests for a specific file
    location /my_file.html {
        root /var/www/html; # This specifies the root directory for the file
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404; # This tells NGINX to try serving the file, and if it can't be found, return a 404 error
    }

    # We can also add additional location blocks for different files or directories

    # Next, we define the error pages to be used if a 404 or 500 error occurs
    error_page 404 /errors/404.html;
    error_page 500 502 503 504 /errors/50x.html;

    # We also specify the error page locations
    location /errors/ {
        internal; # This tells NGINX to only serve these pages internally, and not to clients
        root /var/www/errors; # This specifies the root directory for the error pages
    }

    # Finally, we add any additional configuration such as caching, gzip compression, etc.
