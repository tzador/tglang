# This configuration file demonstrates the different types
# of locations that can be defined in NGINX.

# Firstly, the server block is defined with the port number,
# server name, and error log location.
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

    # Next, the location block is defined for the root directory.
    # This specifies the root directory for the server, as well
    # as any index files to be used.
    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html index.htm;
    }

    # Another location block is defined, this time for the images
    # directory. This location uses regex to match any URL starting
    # with /images and allows access to image files for specific
    # IP addresses.
    location ~ ^/images {
        root /var/www/html;
        
        # The allow and deny directives are used to restrict access
        # to the image files based on IP addresses. The allow block
        # contains a list of IP addresses that are allowed access,
        # while the deny block contains a list of IP addresses that
        # are denied access.
        allow 10.0.0.1;
        allow 192.168.1.0/24;
        deny 10.0.0.2;
        deny 192.168.1.1;
    }

    # A third location block is defined for the PHP scripts directory.
    # This location uses regex to match any URL starting with /scripts
    # and passes the request to a PHP FastCGI server listening on port 9000.
    location ~ ^/scripts {
        root /var/www/html;
        
        # The fastcgi_pass directive specifies the IP address and port
        # of the PHP FastCGI server.
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
    }
