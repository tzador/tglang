# user: user group: group
# Defines the user and group used by nginx for various operations.
# Multi-threaded unix systems usually run nginx as user 'nobody', 
# and the server of single-threaded unix systems usually run it as an 
# unprivileged user.  

user nobody nogroup; 

# The number of worker processes.
# This defaults to the number of CPU cores on your system. 
# If you have an intel processor with hyper-threading enabled, you 
# can add the following line to make use of the extra threads: 

# worker_processes   1; 

# The number of connections each worker can handle simultaneously.
# This should be set to the ulimit value for open file descriptors 
# in your system. If your ulimit is set to 1024, then this should 
# match it. 

worker_connections 1024; 

# Maximum number of open files on a worker process.
# The default value is 1024, which is suitable for most systems. 
# If you are experiencing 'Too many open files' or similar errors, 
# you can increase this value accordingly. 

# worker_rlimit_nofile    1024; 

# Configure error log location.
# By default, the error log is set to /var/log/nginx/error.log
# You can change this location by uncommenting and modifying the 
# following line: 

# error_log   /var/log/nginx/error.log; 

# Configure access log location.
# By default, the access log is set to /var/log/nginx/access.log. 
# You can change this location by uncommenting and modifying the 
# following line: 

# access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log; 

# Configure log format for access logs.
# By default, nginx uses the 'combined' format which includes 
# the remote IP address, the request method and URI, the status code, 
# and the size of the response in bytes. You can change this 
# by uncommenting and modifying the following line: 

# log_format  combined '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request_method $request_uri" '
# ' $status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"'; 

# Define additional configuration files to be included.
# By default, nginx includes the files in the /etc/nginx/conf.d/ directory. 
# You can add additional files to be included using the following 
# directive. Note that the files will be included in alphabetical order. 

# include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf; 

# Configure server
# This is the main server block where you can define the root directory 
# for your website and any additional configurations
