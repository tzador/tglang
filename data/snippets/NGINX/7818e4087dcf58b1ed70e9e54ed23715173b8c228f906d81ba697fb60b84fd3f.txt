location ~* ^/(images|javascript|stylesheets)/ {

}

# This code snippet sets the cache expiration time for images, javascript, and stylesheets to 365 days. 
# It uses the "location" directive to specify the URLs to match, and the "~*" modifier for case-insensitive matching.
# The "^" symbol indicates the beginning of the URL, and the parentheses "( )" are used for grouping.
# The "expires" directive specifies the cache expiration time, and "365d" means 365 days.
# Finally, the curly braces "{ }" enclose the directives for the matched URLs.
