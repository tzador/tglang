# NGINX Configuration File

# This is the main configuration file for the NGINX web server.
# It contains the settings for the server and the website(s) it
# serves. Each website has its own configuration file in the
# 'sites-available' directory, which can be enabled using the
# 'symbolic link' command.

# Set the user and group that NGINX will run under
user www-data;
group www-data;

# Specify the number of worker processes based on the number of cores available
# Typically, 1 worker process per core is recommended, with a maximum of 4
worker_processes auto;

# Define a unique name for the main log file
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

# Define the type of connection that NGINX will use
events {
  # Use the 'epoll' connection method for Linux systems, rather than the default 'select'
  use epoll;

  # Set the maximum number of connections that the server can handle simultaneously
  worker_connections 1024;
}

# Configure the server
http {
  # Set the default port that NGINX will listen on
  listen 80 default_server;

  # Tell NGINX to use the worker processes for each CPU core
  # This can improve performance by distributing the load evenly

  # Enable gzip compression for all responses to reduce the size of data sent to clients
  gzip on;
