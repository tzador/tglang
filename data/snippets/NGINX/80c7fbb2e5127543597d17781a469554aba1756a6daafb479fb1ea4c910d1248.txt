// This is a basic NGINX server configuration with multiple location blocks. The server listens on port 80 for requests from the server name example.com. The first location block handles requests for the root directory, serving HTML files from the html directory and using index.html as the default file. The second location block handles requests for PHP files, passing them to PHP-FPM and using index.php as the default file. The third location block handles requests for the images directory, setting an expiration time of 1 day for cached images. The server also has custom error pages for 404 and 50x errors, with a separate location block for the 50x error page.
