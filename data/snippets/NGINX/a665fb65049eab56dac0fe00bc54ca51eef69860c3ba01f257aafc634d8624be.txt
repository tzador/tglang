# This nginx configuration snippet will set up a virtual server to proxy pass requests to a Node.js application.

# Start by setting up the server block to listen on a specific port and server name:
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name example.com;

  # Set the location directive to handle all requests under the root path:
  location / {
    # Point to the public IP address or hostname of the Node.js application:
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;

    # Configure caching options for improved performance:
    proxy_cache one;
    proxy_cache_valid 200 302 10m;
    proxy_cache_valid 404 1m;
  }

  # Add in other specific configurations as needed:
  # For example, to enable SSL:
  ssl on;
  
  # Configure the paths to the SSL certificate and key:
  ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/cert.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/key.pem;

  # Configure the SSL ciphers and protocols:
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
}


# This code snippet uses NGINX's virtual server feature to set up a reverse proxy for a Node.js application. The server block listens on port 80 and the server name is set to example.com.

# The location directive is used to handle all requests under the root path "/" and is set to proxy pass requests to the public IP address or hostname of the Node.js application running on port 3000.

# The proxy cache settings are configured to improve performance by caching responses for 10 minutes for successful requests (HTTP status code 200 and 302) and 1 minute for unsuccessful requests (HTTP status code 404).

# Additional configurations can also be added, such as enabling SSL for secure connections. The paths to the SSL certificate and key are specified and the SSL protocols and ciphers are configured for secure communication.

# To use this snippet, replace "example.com" with your own server name and update the proxy_pass to point to your Node.js application's IP address and port. You can also customize the cache settings and add any other desired configurations.
