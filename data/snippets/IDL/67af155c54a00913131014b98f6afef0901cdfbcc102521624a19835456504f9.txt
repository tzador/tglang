;; This is an example code snippet in IDL.
;; It displays a graphic plot with points and lines.

;; Define the x and y coordinates for the points.
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
y = [0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]

;; Define the graphics window and set its properties.
win = WIDGET_BASE(TITLE='Plot', XSIZE=500, YSIZE=500)

;; Define the plot object and set its properties.
plot = PLOT(x, y, XTITLE='X Axis', YTITLE='Y Axis', $
  PSYM=2, /DEVICE, COLOR='blue')

;; Draw the plot on the graphics window.
WIDGET_CONTROL, win, DRAW

;; Save the plot as a JPEG image file.
name = 'plot_example.jpg'
WRITE_JPEG, name, win

;; Close the graphics window.
