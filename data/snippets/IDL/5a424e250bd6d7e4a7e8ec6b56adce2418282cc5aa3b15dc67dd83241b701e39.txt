;; Define a function that calculates the area of a triangle given the length of its three sides

FUNCTION triangle_area, a, b, c

  ;; Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle
  s = (a + b + c) / 2

  ;; Use Heron's formula to calculate the area
  area = SQRT(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

  ;; Return the area of the triangle
  RETURN area
END

;; Declare variables for the lengths of the triangle's sides
a = 3.4
b = 5.6
c = 4.2

;; Call the triangle_area function and store the result in a variable
triangle_area = triangle_area(a, b, c)

;; Print the result
PRINT, 'The area of the triangle with sides', a, ',', b, 'and', c, 'is', triangle_area
