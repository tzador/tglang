;; This code snippet is written in IDL (Interactive Data Language)
;; It calculates the average value of an array

pro calc_average, arr
;; This procedure takes in an array as input and calculates the average value
;; Parameters:
;; arr: an array of values

;; Create variables to store sum and count
sum = 0 ;; Sum of all elements in the array
i = 0   ;; Count of the elements in the array

;; Use a for loop to iterate through the array and calculate sum and count
for j=0,n_elements(arr)-1 do begin
    sum = sum + arr[j] ;; Add current element to the sum
    i = i + 1         ;; Increase count by 1
endfor

;; Calculate the average value
avg = sum/i ;; Divide sum by count

;; Print the average value and return it
print, "The average value is: ", avg
return, avg
