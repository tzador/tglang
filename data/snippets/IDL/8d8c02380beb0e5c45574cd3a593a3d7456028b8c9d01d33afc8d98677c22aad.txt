; This program calculates the surface gravity of a planet 
; using the mass and radius provided by the user.

; Input variables
mass = 6.39e23 ; mass of the planet in kilograms
radius = 3.39e6 ; radius of the planet in meters

; Constants
G = 6.67e-11 ; gravitational constant in m^3/(kg*s^2)
pi = 3.14159 ; value of pi

; Calculate the surface gravity
; using the formula g = (G * mass) / (radius^2)
g = (G * mass) / (radius^2)

; Output the result
print, "The surface gravity of the planet is: ", g, "m/s^2"
