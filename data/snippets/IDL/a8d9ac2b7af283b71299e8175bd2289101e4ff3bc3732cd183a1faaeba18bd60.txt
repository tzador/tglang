; This is a complex code snippet in IDL

; Set up variables
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

; Define a function
FUNCTION complex_function, a, b, c
    ; Calculate the result
    result = a * b + c

    ; Check for special cases
    IF result EQ 0 THEN BEGIN
        PRINT, 'Result is zero!'
    ENDIF ELSE IF result LT 0 THEN BEGIN
        PRINT, 'Result is negative!'
    ENDIF ELSE BEGIN
        PRINT, 'Result is positive!'
    ENDELSE

    ; Return the result
    RETURN, result
END

; Call the function and assign the result to a variable
d = complex_function(a, b, c)

; Print out the result
PRINT, d

; This code snippet showcases variable assignment, function definition and usage, as well as conditional statements in IDL.
; It can be used to perform basic calculations and handle special cases.
