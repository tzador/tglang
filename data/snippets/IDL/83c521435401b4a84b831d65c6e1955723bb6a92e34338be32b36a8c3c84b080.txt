pro sample, x, y
; This is a procedure called sample with two input parameters, x and y
   compile_opt strictarr
; This ensures strict data typing for the procedure
   all_pixels = fltarr(nx,ny)
; This creates a two-dimensional array of type float with dimensions nx by ny
   for i = 0, nx - 1 do begin
; This for loop iterates through each row of the array
      for j = 0, ny - 1 do begin
; This for loop iterates through each column of the array
         all_pixels[i,j] = x[i] * y[j]
; This performs a mathematical operation on the pixels in the array based on the x and y inputs
      endfor
   endfor
   return, all_pixels
; This returns the resulting array of pixels
end
; End of the procedure
