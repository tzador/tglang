; This is a sample code snippet in IDL

; Define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
; Inputs:
;   n: Integer, the number whose factorial is to be calculated
; Output:
;   result: Integer, the factorial of the given number
function factorial, n

  ; Initialize result to 1
  result = 1

  ; Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n
  for i=1, n do begin
    ; Use the *= operator to multiply result by i
    result *= i
  endfor

  ; Return the final result
  return, result
end
