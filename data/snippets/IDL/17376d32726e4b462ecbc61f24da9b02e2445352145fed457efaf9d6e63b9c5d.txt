; This is a complex code snippet written in IDL programming language
; It creates an array of 100 random numbers between 0 and 10 and calculates their average

pro rand_avg

    ; Declare variables
    rand_num = fltarr(100)          ; array of 100 random numbers
    total = 0                       ; running total of random numbers
    avg = 0.0                       ; calculated average value

    ; Generate 100 random numbers
    for i=0, 99 do begin
        rand_num[i] = randomu(seed, 10.0)
    endfor

    ; Calculate total of random numbers
    total = total + rand_num

    ; Calculate average
    avg = total / 100.0

    ; Print results
    print, 'Random numbers:', rand_num
    print, 'Average:', avg
