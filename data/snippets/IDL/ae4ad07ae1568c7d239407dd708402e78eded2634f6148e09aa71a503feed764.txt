; This code snippet creates a function that calculates the area of a triangle given the coordinates of its vertices
FUNCTION triangle_area, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3
  area = abs((x2-x1)*(y3-y1)-(x3-x1)*(y2-y1))/2 ; calculate the area using the shoelace formula
  RETURN area ; return the result
END

; define the coordinates of the triangle's vertices
x1 = 3.14 
y1 = 2.71
x2 = 4.2
y2 = 1.5
x3 = 5.6
y3 = 3.8

; call the function to calculate the area of the triangle
area = triangle_area(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)

; print the result
PRINT, area

; Output:
;The output should be a printed statement of the area of the triangle.
