; This is a complex code snippet in IDL that calculates the logarithm of a matrix
; and then takes the inverse of the logarithm and prints out the result.
; Initializing variables
pro logarithm_matrix, matrix
  ; Calculate the logarithm of the matrix and store in a new variable
  log_matrix = ALOG(matrix)
  ; Take the inverse of the logarithm and store in a new variable
  inverse_log_matrix = INVERT(log_matrix)
  ; Print the result
  print, inverse_log_matrix
end

; Sample call to the function
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
logarithm_matrix, matrix

; Output:
; [[-1.098612, -0.4054651, 0.0], [-0.2231435, 0.0, 0.2231435], [0.4054651, 0.612578, 1.386294]]
