PRO ang_to_cart, theta, rho, xpos, ypos ; Define a procedure called "ang_to_cart"
; This procedure takes in two parameters: a theta value and a rho value
; The procedure also defines two local variables: xpos and ypos
; The output variables are also defined as global variables

; Convert theta from degrees to radians, as IDL uses radians in trigonometric functions
theta = theta * !dpi / 180.

; Calculate the x and y coordinates using the given theta and rho values
; Store the results in the local variables xpos and ypos
xpos = rho * cos(theta)
ypos = rho * sin(theta)

; Set the global output variables to the calculated values
XPOS = xpos
YPOS = ypos
