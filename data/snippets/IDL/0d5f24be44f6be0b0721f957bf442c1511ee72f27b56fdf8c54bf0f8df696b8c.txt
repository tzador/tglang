;Example program in IDL to calculate the mean and standard deviation of an array

   ;; Define a procedure to calculate the mean of an array
pro calculate_mean, array
   ;; calculate the sum of all elements in the array
   total = total(array)
   ;; divide sum by the number of elements in the array to get the mean
   mean = total / n_elements(array)
   ;; print the mean value
   print, "The mean of the array is: ", mean
end

;; Define a procedure to calculate the standard deviation of an array
pro calculate_std, array
   ;; call the calculate_mean procedure to get the mean of the array
   calculate_mean, array
   ;; calculate the difference between each element and the mean
   diff = array - mean
   ;; square each difference
   sq_diff = diff^2
   ;; calculate the sum of all squared differences
   sum_sq_diff = total(sq_diff)
   ;; divide sum by the number of elements in the array minus 1
   s = sum_sq_diff / (n_elements(array)-1)
   ;; take the square root to get the standard deviation
   std = sqrt(s)
   ;; print the standard deviation value
   print, "The standard deviation of the array is: ", std
end

;; Create an array with random numbers
array = randomu(seed, 10)

;; Call the calculate_std procedure to calculate the standard deviation of the array
calculate_std, array
