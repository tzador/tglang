PRO read_data
  ; This subroutine reads in data from a file and stores it in an array
  ; Inputs:
  ; - file_name: string containing name of file to be read
  ; Outputs:
  ; - data: array of floating point data read from file
  ; - n: integer number of data points read
  ; - status: integer status code, where 1 indicates success and 
  ;       any other value indicates an error
  ; Example usage:
  ; data = read_data("input.txt", n, status)
  
  ; Declare variables
  STRING file_name          ; input file name
  FILE fid                  ; file ID of opened file
  FLOAT data[100]           ; array to store data
  INT n                     ; counter for number of data points read
  INT status                ; status code
  
  ; Open file for reading
  fid = FOPEN(file_name, READ=1, STATUS=status)
  
  ; Check for any errors in opening the file
  IF (status NE 1) THEN BEGIN
    PRINT, "Error opening file: " + file_name
    RETURN, data, 0, status
  ENDIF
  
  ; Read data from file until end of file is reached
  n = 0
  WHILE (NOT(FEOF(fid))) DO BEGIN
    READF, fid, data[n]
    n = n + 1
  ENDDO
  
  ; Close file
  FID = FCLOSE(fid)
  
  ; Return data, number of data points read, and status code
  RETURN, data, n, 1
