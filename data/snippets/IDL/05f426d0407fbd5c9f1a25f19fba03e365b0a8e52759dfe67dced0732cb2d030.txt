pro print_matrix, matrix
;
; This procedure prints out a matrix with nice formatting
;
; Inputs:
;   matrix: 2D array containing the matrix
;
for i=0, size(matrix,1)-1 do begin
    print, ' ', matrix(i,*)
endfor
end

**Explanation:**

This is a procedure in IDL that prints a given matrix. The input parameter 'matrix' is a 2D array containing the values of the matrix. The 'for' loop goes through each row of the matrix and prints it using the 'print' command. The '*' character represents all columns in a given row. Finally, the 'endfor' statement ends the loop and the 'end' statement ends the procedure.
