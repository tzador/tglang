; Define a function that calculates the average of two given numbers
FUNCTION average
  ; Declare the inputs
  ARGUMENT a, b
  ; Calculate the sum of the two inputs
  sum = a + b
  ; Divide the sum by 2 to get the average
  avg = sum / 2
  ; Return the average value
  RETURN, avg
END

; Create an array with 5 elements
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

; Loop through the array and calculate the average of each pair of elements
FOR i=0, 3 DO BEGIN
  ; Assign the current element and the next element to variables
  el1 = numbers[i]
  el2 = numbers[i+1]
  ; Use the average function to calculate the average
  result = average(el1, el2)
  ; Print the result
  PRINT, 'The average of elements', i, 'and', i+1, 'is', result
ENDFOR

; Output:
; The average of elements 0 and 1 is 3
; The average of elements 1 and 2 is 5
; The average of elements 2 and 3 is 7
; The average of elements 3 and 4 is 9
