; This program calculates the average of three numbers
function calculateAverage(num1, num2, num3)
begin
  ; Calculate sum of the three numbers
  sum = num1 + num2 + num3
  
  ; Calculate the average
  average = sum / 3
  
  ; Return the average
  return average
end

; Create an array to store the three numbers
numbers = [12, 43, 67]

; Call the calculateAverage function and pass in the three numbers
result = calculateAverage(numbers[0], numbers[1], numbers[2])

; Print the result to the screen
print, "The average of " + string(numbers[0]) + ", " + string(numbers[1]) + " and " + string(numbers[2]) + " is " + string(result)
