pro correlation, x, y
;Calculates the correlation coefficient between two variables
;Inputs:
;   x: an array containing the first variable
;   y: an array containing the second variable
;Output:
;   r: the correlation coefficient between x and y
 
;Calculate the means of x and y
mean_x = mean(x)
mean_y = mean(y)
 
;Calculate the standard deviations of x and y
std_dev_x = std_dev(x)
std_dev_y = std_dev(y)
 
;Calculate the covariance between x and y
cov = cov(x, y)
 
;Calculate the correlation coefficient
r = cov / (std_dev_x * std_dev_y)
 
;Print the result
print, "The correlation coefficient is: ", r
