; This code snippet uses the IDL programming language to create and manipulate a 3D image

;; Create a 3D image array of size 100x100x50
image = fltarr(100,100,50)

;; Generate random values between 0 and 1 for each pixel in the image
random_image = randomu(image)

;; Apply a 3D Gaussian filter to smooth the image
smooth_image = convol(image, gauss_3d(5))

;; Threshold the image to remove low intensity values
smooth_image[where(smooth_image < 0.5)] = 0

;; Rotate the image by 45 degrees around the x-axis
rotated_image = rotate(image, 45, axis=2, center=[50,50,25])

;; Add a text label to the image
label = 'This is a 3D image'
text_image = string(smooth_image, label, pos=[50,50,25])

;; Create a plot of the image, with labels and title
plot3d, image, title='3D Image Plot', xtitle='X-Axis', ytitle='Y-Axis', ztitle='Z-Axis'

;; Save the image to a file
save_tiff, text_image, 'image.tiff'
