; This is a function that calculates the covariance matrix of a given data set
; Inputs:
;    data - the raw data set
; Outputs:
;    covariance - the covariance matrix of the data set

function covariancematrix, data

; Determine the size of the data set
n = n_elements(data[0,*])

; Calculate the mean of each column (variable) in the data set
mean = total(data, 1) / n

; Subtract the mean from each observation in the data set
data = data - mean

; Initialize the covariance matrix with the correct dimensions
covariance = replicate(0, n, n)

; Loop through each variable and calculate the covariance with itself and other variables
for i=0,n-1 do begin
    for j=0,n-1 do begin

        ; Calculate the covariance as the sum of the products of deviations from the means
        covariance[i,j] = total(data[i,*] * data[j,*])

        ; Divide by (n-1) to account for the sample size
        covariance[i,j] = covariance[i,j] / (n-1)
    endfor
endfor

; Return the covariance matrix
return, covariance
