PROUD idlCode

; This code snippet generates a random array of numbers and determines the mean, median, and standard deviation of the array

FUNCTION idlCode
; --- generate random numbers ---
data = RANDOMU(seed, data)

; --- find mean ---
mean = TOTAL(data) / 10

; --- find median ---
median = DATA(TOTAL(sort(data)) / 2)

; --- find standard deviation ---
squareSum = TOTAL((data - mean)^2)
stdDev = sqrt(squareSum / 10)

; print results
PRINT, 'Mean:', mean
PRINT, 'Median:', median
PRINT, 'Standard Deviation:', stdDev
