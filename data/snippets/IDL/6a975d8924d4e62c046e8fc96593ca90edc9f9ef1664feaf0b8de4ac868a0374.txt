; This code snippet creates a function and uses an array to calculate the derivative of a given equation
function derivative, x, y, derivative 
; The function takes in 3 parameters: x array, y array, and the derivative array
; x and y arrays are the input points of the equation, while the derivative array will store the calculated derivative values
  for i=0, n_elements(x)-2 do begin
  ; Looping through the x array from the first element to the second-to-last element
    derivative[i] = (y[i+1]-y[i])/(x[i+1]-x[i])
    ; Calculating the derivative at each point using the "rise over run" method
