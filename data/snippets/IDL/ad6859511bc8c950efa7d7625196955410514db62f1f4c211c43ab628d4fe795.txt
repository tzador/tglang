pro oreo_cookie
;;; This program calculates the number of oreo cookies a person can eat in a given time span.
;;; The cookie facts we'll use are: 1 lb of oreos = ~39 cookies, and the average person eats 1 lb of cookies in 2 weeks.
 
;;; Variable declarations:
  compile_opt strictarr
  oreo_count = 0.0d 
  lb_count = 0.0d
 
;;; Ask for user input:
  print, 'How many weeks would you like to calculate?'
  read, input_weeks
 
;;; Calculation loop:
  for i = 1, input_weeks do begin
   ;;; 1 lb of oreos = ~39 cookies, so divide the number of weeks by two
    lb_count = input_weeks / 2
    ;;; Now convert the lb count to a decimal count of cookies
    oreo_count = lb_count * 39
    ;;; Finally, print the result
    print, 'After', i, 'weeks, you can eat', oreo_count, 'oreo cookies!'
  endfor
