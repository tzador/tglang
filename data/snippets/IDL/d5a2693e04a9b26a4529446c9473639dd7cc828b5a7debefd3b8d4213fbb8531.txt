; This is a comment in IDL to explain the purpose of the code snippet
; This snippet uses an advanced function to calculate the factorial of a number

FUNCTION factor, n
; This function takes in a single parameter n, which is the number to calculate the factorial of
    result = n
    FOR i = (n - 1) TO 1 STEP -1
    ; This loop iterates from n-1 to 1, multiplying the result by each number
        result = result * i
    ENDFOR
    RETURN, result
END

number = 5 ; Assigns the value 5 to the variable number
factorial = factor(number) ; Calls the factor function with number as the parameter and assigns the result to factorial

PRINT, 'The factorial of ' , number, ' is ' , factorial ; Prints the result to the screen
