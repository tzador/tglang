PROTECT data         ;This line declares a variable named "data" and protects it from modification

;This section of code reads data from a file and assigns it to the variable
OPENR, unit, "inputfile.dat"   ;Open the input file
READF, unit, data   ;Read the data from the file and assign it to "data"
FREE_LUN, unit      ;Close the input file

;This part of the code performs some operations on the data
FOR i=0L, n_elements(data)-1 DO BEGIN   ;Loop over each element in "data"
    temp = data[i] * 2   ;Multiply the current element by 2 and assign it to "temp"
    IF i MOD 2 EQ 0 THEN data[i] = temp   ;If the index is even, update the value in "data" with "temp"
ENDFOR

;This section of code plots the data with some formatting options
PLOT, data, /NOERASE, COLOR='red', THICK=2   ;Plot the data in red with thicker lines

;This part of the code calculates some statistics on the data and prints them to the console
mean = MEAN(data)   ;Calculate the mean of "data" and assign it to "mean"
median = MEDIAN(data)   ;Calculate the median of "data" and assign it to "median"
PRINT, "The mean is ", mean   ;Print the mean to the console
PRINT, "The median is ", median   ;Print the median to the console

;This section of code saves the updated data to a new file
OPENW, new_unit, "outputfile.dat"   ;Open a new output file
WRITEU, new_unit, data   ;Write the updated "data" to the file
FREE_LUN, new_unit   ;Close the output file
