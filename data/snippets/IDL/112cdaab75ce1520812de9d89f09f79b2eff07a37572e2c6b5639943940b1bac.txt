pro WHITEN, data, variance
; This is a procedure called WHITEN that takes in two parameters: data and variance
  n = n_elements(data)
; This sets the variable n to the number of elements in the data array
  for i=0L, n-1 do begin
  ; This is a for loop that iterates through the indices of the data array
    for j=0L, n-1 do begin
    ; This is a nested for loop
      if i ne j then begin
      ; This if statement checks if the indices are not equal
        data[i] = data[i] / SQRT(variance[j])
        ; This updates the data array by dividing the value at index i by the square root of the variance at index j
      endif
    endfor
  endfor
; This ends the nested for loops
end
; This ends the procedure
