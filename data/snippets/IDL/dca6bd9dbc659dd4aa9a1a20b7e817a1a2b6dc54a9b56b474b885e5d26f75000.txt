; This is an IDL program that creates an array of 10 integers and prints the sum of the array

; Declare and initialize an array of 10 integers
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

; Declare a variable to store the sum
sum = 0

; Use a for loop to iterate through the array and calculate the sum
for i = 0 to 9 do begin
    sum = sum + arr[i]
endfor

; Print the sum
print, 'The sum of the array is: ', sum
