PRO compute_average, data
; This is a procedure that computes the average of an array of data
;
; Parameters:
;   data: input, array of data
;
; Returns:
;   The average of the array data
;
; Example:
;   Data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
;   Avg = compute_average(Data)
;
;   Output: 
;   Avg = 3.0

; Define a variable to store the sum of the data
total = 0

; Loop through each element in the data array
for i=0, n_elements(data)-1 do begin
    total = total + data[i]
endfor

; Calculate the average by dividing the sum of data by the total number of elements
average = total / n_elements(data)

; Print the average value
print, 'The average of the given data is: ', average

; Return the average value as the output of the procedure
return, average

; END of procedure
