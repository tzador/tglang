pro long_fibonacci, num
;; This is a procedure that calculates the first num terms of the Fibonacci sequence
;; using long precision to avoid integer overflow.
;; Function inputs:
;;      num - number of terms in the sequence to calculate
;;
;; Returns:
;;      fib_array - an array containing the first num terms of the Fibonacci sequence
  fib_array = lindgen(num) ;; initialize an array with indices from 0 to num-1
  fib_array[0] = 0 ;; first term of the sequence is always 0
  fib_array[1] = 1 ;; second term is always 1
  
  for i = 2L, num-1 do begin ;; loop through the array and calculate each term
    fib_array[i] = fib_array[i-1] + fib_array[i-2] ;; Fibonacci formula using long precision
  endfor
  
  return, fib_array ;; return the array containing the first num terms of the Fibonacci sequence
