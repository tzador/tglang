; This code snippet calculates the Euclidean distance between two 3-dimensional points.

; Define a function that takes in two 3-dimensional arrays as inputs
FUNCTION euclidean_distance, point1, point2

; Define local variables to store the distances between each coordinate
; The distance formula is sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2)
DIST_X = SQRT((point2[0]-point1[0])^2)
DIST_Y = SQRT((point2[1]-point1[1])^2)
DIST_Z = SQRT((point2[2]-point1[2])^2)

; Calculate the total distance by adding the distances of each coordinate
DIST = DIST_X + DIST_Y + DIST_Z

; Return the distance
RETURN, DIST

; Define two 3-dimensional arrays with the coordinates of each point
point1 = [1, 2, 3]
point2 = [4, 5, 6]

; Call the function and store the result in a variable
result = euclidean_distance(point1, point2)

; Print the result to the screen
PRINT, "The distance between", point1, "and", point2, "is", result
