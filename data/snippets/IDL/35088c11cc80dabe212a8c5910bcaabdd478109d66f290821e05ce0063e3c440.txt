PRO GET_TOTAL, ARRAY     ; A procedure to calculate the total of an array
   TOTAL = 0             ; Set initial value of total to 0
   FOR I = 0, 9 DO BEGIN ; Loop through each element in the array
      TOTAL = TOTAL + ARRAY[I]   ; Add the value of the current element to total
   ENDFOR
END

; An example of calling the procedure with an array of 10 elements
ARR = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
RESULT = GET_TOTAL(ARR)

; Print the result
PRINT, "The total of the array is", RESULT     ; Output: The total of the array is 55
