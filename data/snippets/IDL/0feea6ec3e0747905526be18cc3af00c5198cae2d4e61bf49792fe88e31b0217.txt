; This code snippet generates a random array of numbers and performs vector operations on it

; Generate a random 2D array of size 5x5
numbers = rndu(seed,5,5)

; Check the array values
print, numbers

; Calculate the sum of all values in the array
sum = total(numbers)

; Calculate the mean of the array
mean = mean(numbers)

; Calculate the standard deviation of the array
stddev = stddev(numbers)

; Calculate the maximum value in the array
max = max(numbers)

; Calculate the minimum value in the array
min = min(numbers)

; Print the results
print, "Sum: ", sum
print, "Mean: ", mean
print, "Standard Deviation: ", stddev
print, "Max: ", max
print, "Min: ", min
