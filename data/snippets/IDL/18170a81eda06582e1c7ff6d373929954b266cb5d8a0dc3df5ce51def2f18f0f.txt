pro fibo, n, fibo_result
; This is a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term and returns the result
; Inputs:
;   n - the nth term of the sequence to be calculated
; Outputs:
;   fibo_result - an array containing the sequence up to the nth term
;
; Notes:
; - The first two terms of the sequence are always 0 and 1
; - The nth term can be calculated by adding the previous two terms
;
; Define a variable to hold the result array
result = fltarr(n)

; Set the first two terms of the sequence
result[0] = 0
result[1] = 1

; Loop through the remaining terms
for i = 2, n - 1 do begin

	; Add the previous two terms and store the result
	result[i] = result[i-1] + result[i-2]
endfor

; Store the final result in the output variable
fibo_result = result

; End of function
