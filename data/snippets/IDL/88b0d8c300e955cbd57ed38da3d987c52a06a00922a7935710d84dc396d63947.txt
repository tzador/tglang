; This code snippet creates a function called 'calc_std_dev'
; that calculates the standard deviation of a given array
; of numbers

; Define function
FUNCTION calc_std_dev, array

; Calculate mean of array
mean = TOTAL(array) / N_ELEMENTS(array)

; Calculate squared differences between array elements and mean
squared_diff = (array - mean)^2

; Calculate sum of squared differences and divide by number of elements
sum_squared_diff = TOTAL(squared_diff) / N_ELEMENTS(squared_diff)

; Take square root of sum to get standard deviation
std_dev = SQRT(sum_squared_diff)

; Return standard deviation value
RETURN, std_dev

; End function definition
END
