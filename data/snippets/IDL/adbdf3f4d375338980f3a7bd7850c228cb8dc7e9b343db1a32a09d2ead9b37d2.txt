pro example_code,x
; An example procedure in IDL
; This procedure takes in a parameter, x, and performs a series of calculations using various built-in functions in IDL.
; The output of the calculations is printed to the terminal

; Define variables
a = 5     ; assign a value to a
b = 10    ; assign a value to b
c = x * b ; multiply x by b and assign it to c

; Perform calculations and print to terminal
print, "The sine of x is: ", sin(x)
print, "The cosine of x is: ", cos(x)
print, "The square root of a is: ", sqrt(a)
print, "The logarithm of b is: ", log(b)
print, "The product of a and c is: ", a*c
