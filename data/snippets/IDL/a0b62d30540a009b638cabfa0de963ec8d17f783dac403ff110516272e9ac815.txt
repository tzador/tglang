;
; This procedure calculates the fibonacci sequence up to the nth term
;
; Inputs:
;       n: integer, number of terms in the sequence
;
; Outputs:
;       sequence: array, containing the fibonacci sequence
;

sequence = [0,1] ; initializing the sequence with first two terms
for i=2,n do begin
    sequence[i] = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2] ; using recurrence relation to generate new term
endfor

print, sequence ; printing the final sequence
end
