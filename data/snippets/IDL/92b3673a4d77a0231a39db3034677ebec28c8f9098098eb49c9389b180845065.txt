;; This code snippet is written in IDL (Interactive Data Language)

;; Define a function that takes in two arrays and returns the correlation coefficient between them
FUNCTION CORRELATE, x, y

;; Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each array
x_mean = mean(x)
y_mean = mean(y)
x_stddev = stddev(x)
y_stddev = stddev(y)

;; Calculate the correlation coefficient using the formula
r = sum((x-x_mean)*(y-y_mean)) / (n_elements(x)*x_stddev*y_stddev)

;; Return the correlation coefficient
RETURN, r
