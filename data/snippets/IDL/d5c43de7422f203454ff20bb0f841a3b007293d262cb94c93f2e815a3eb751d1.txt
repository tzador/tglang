ARR = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] ; define the array
 
FOR I=1, 10 DO BEGIN ; start a FOR loop
    IF I LT 5 THEN BEGIN ; condition to check if I is less than 5
        ARR[I] = ARR[I] * 2 ; multiply the value at index I by 2
    ENDIF ELSE IF I GT 5 THEN BEGIN ; condition to check if I is greater than 5
        ARR[I] = ARR[I] / 2 ; divide the value at index I by 2
    ENDIF ELSE BEGIN ; execute if neither condition is met (I equals 5)
        ARR[I] = 0 ; set the value at index I to 0

ENDFOR ; end of FOR loop

PRINT, "Modified array:", ARR ; print the modified array to the output
