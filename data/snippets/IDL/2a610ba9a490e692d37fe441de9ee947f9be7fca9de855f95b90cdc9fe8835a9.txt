; This code snippet creates a function in IDL to calculate the area of a rectangle given the length and width.
; The function is called "rectangle_area" and takes two arguments, "length" and "width".
; It also includes local variables "height" and "area" for intermediate calculations.
rectangle_area : procedure
    ; Define input parameters
    defparams length, width

    ; Local variables
    height = length / width
    area = length * width

    ; Return the calculated area
    return, area
end
