; This IDL code snippet was generated by
; the program "IDL Studio" for the purpose
; of demonstrating a complex array operation

; Define a 5x5x5 complex array
complex_array = complex(5, 5, 5)

; Loop through the first dimension
for i = 0, 4 do begin
    ; Loop through the second dimension
    for j = 0, 4 do begin
        ; Loop through the third dimension
        for k = 0, 4 do begin
            ; Randomly fill each element in the array with complex numbers
            complex_array[i, j, k] = randomu(seed=i+j+k, n=1, complex=1)
        endfor
    endfor
endfor

; Print the original array
print, 'Original Array:'
print, complex_array

; Compute the magnitude of each complex number
magnitude = sqrt(complex_array.real^2 + complex_array.imaginary^2)

; Print the array of magnitudes
print, 'Array of Magnitudes:'
print, magnitude

; Now, let's print only the elements with a magnitude greater than 5
print, 'Elements with magnitude greater than 5:'
print, magnitude[magnitude GT 5]

; Finally, let's take the sum of the magnitude array
magnitude_sum = total(magnitude)

; Print the sum of magnitudes
print, 'Sum of Magnitudes:'
print, magnitude_sum
