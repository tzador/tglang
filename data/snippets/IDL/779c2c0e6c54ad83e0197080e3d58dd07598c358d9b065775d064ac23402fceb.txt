; This code snippet uses IDL (Interactive Data Language) to find the average of an array of numbers

pro avg_calculator, arr
  ; Calculate the size of the array
  n = n_elements(arr)

  ; Initialize the sum variable to 0
  sum = 0.0

  ; Loop through the array and add each element to the sum variable
  for i=0, n-1 do begin
    sum = sum + arr[i]
  endfor

  ; Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements
  avg = sum / n

  ; Print the results
  print, 'The average of the array is: ', avg
end
