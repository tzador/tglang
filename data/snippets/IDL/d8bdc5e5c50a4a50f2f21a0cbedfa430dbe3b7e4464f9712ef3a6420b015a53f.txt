; This program calculates the total energy of a system by summing the kinetic and potential energies of its particles.
; First, we define a function that calculates the kinetic energy of a particle given its mass and velocity.
FUNCTION kinetic_energy, mass, velocity
	energy = 0.5*mass*velocity^2 ; calculate the kinetic energy using the classical formula
	RETURN, energy
END
; Next, we define a function that calculates the potential energy of a pair of particles given their masses and positions.
FUNCTION potential_energy, mass1, mass2, position1, position2
	energy = -G*mass1*mass2 / (position2-position1) ; calculate the potential energy using Newton's law of gravitation
	RETURN, energy
END
; Now, we create an array of masses and velocities for each particle in the system.
masses = [5.0, 3.0, 9.0] ; masses of particles in kg
velocities = [10.0, -5.0, -2.0] ; velocities of particles in m/s
; Initialize the total energy variable.
total_energy = 0.0
; Loop through each pair of particles and calculate their kinetic and potential energies.
FOR i=0,2 DO BEGIN
	FOR j=i+1,2 DO BEGIN
		kinetic = kinetic_energy(masses[i], velocities[i]) ; calculate kinetic energy of particle i
		potential = potential_energy(masses[i], masses[j], positions[i], positions[j]) ; calculate potential energy of particles i and j
		total_energy += kinetic + potential ; add the energies to the total energy
	ENDFOR
ENDFOR
; Print the total energy of the system.
PRINT, 'The total energy of the system is', total_energy, 'J'
