; Define a function named 'compute_average' that takes in an array of integers named 'arr' and returns a single float value
function compute_average(arr)
    ; Initialize a variable named 'total' to store the sum of all values in the array
    total = 0.0 
    ; Use a for loop to iterate through each element in the array
    for i = 0, n_elements(arr)-1 do begin
        ; Add the current element to the total sum
        total = total + arr[i] 
    endfor
    ; Determine the total number of elements in the array by calling the 'n_elements' function
    num_elements = n_elements(arr) 
    ; Compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of elements
    average = total / num_elements 
    ; Return the computed average
    return average
