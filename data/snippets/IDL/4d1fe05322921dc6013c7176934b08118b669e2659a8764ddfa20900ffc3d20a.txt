; Define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
; Input: n - the number to calculate the factorial of
; Output: the factorial of n

FUNCTION factorial, n

; Declare local variables
    a = 1 ; start with the value 1
    b = n ; store the value of n in another variable
    
    ; Loop through each number from 1 to n
    ; and multiply it with a
    FOR i=1,n DO BEGIN
    
        a = a * b ; multiply current value of a with b
        b = b - 1 ; decrement value of b by 1
        
    ENDFOR ; end of loop
    
    RETURN, a ; return the final value of a as the factorial of n
END ; end of function

; Example usage
result = factorial(5) ; calculate the factorial of 5 and store in result variable
PRINT, 'The factorial of 5 is:', result ; print the result
