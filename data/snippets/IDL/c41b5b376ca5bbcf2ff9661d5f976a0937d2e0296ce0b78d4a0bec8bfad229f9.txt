pro triquadfunc, x, a, b, c, coefnc
compile_opt strictarr

; This procedure calculates a quadratic function of the form ax^2 + bx + c
;
;       x       - The independent variable
;       a, b, c - The coefficients of the function
;       coefnc  - An array to store the calculated coefficients
;
;       OUTPUT:
;       coefnc[0] - The calculated value of a
;       coefnc[1] - The calculated value of b
;       coefnc[2] - The calculated value of c

; Calculate the coefficients
coefnc[2] = c
coefnc[1] = b
coefnc[0] = a

; Evaluate the function
return, coefnc[0]*x^2 + coefnc[1]*x + coefnc[2]
