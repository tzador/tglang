;; A function that calculates the sum of squares for a given range of numbers

FUNCTION sum_squares, x, y, result
;; This function takes in two integers (x and y) and calculates the sum of squares for the range between them. The result is then returned as a single integer value.

  ;; First, we declare an empty array to store the squares
  squares = []

  ;; Next, we loop through the range between x and y (inclusive)
  FOR i = x TO y DO BEGIN

    ;; Calculate the square of the current number
    current_square = i * i

    ;; Append the square to the array
    squares = [squares, current_square]

  ENDFOR

  ;; Now, we use the built-in SUM function to add up all the squares in the array
  result = SUM(squares)

  ;; Finally, we return the result
  RETURN, result
