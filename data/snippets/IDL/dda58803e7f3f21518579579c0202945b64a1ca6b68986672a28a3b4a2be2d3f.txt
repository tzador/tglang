; This code snippet creates a function that finds the slope of a linear
; equation given two points.
function slope, x1, y1, x2, y2
  ; Calculates the change in y values
  dy = y2 - y1

  ; Calculates the change in x values
  dx = x2 - x1

  ; Calculates the slope using the formula dy/dx
  m = dy/dx

  ; Prints the slope to the screen
  print, 'The slope of the line is: ' + m

  ; Returns the slope to the main program
  return, m
