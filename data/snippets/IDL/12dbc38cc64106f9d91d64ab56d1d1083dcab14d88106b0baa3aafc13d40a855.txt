; This program calculates the average of a set of numbers 
; First, set up an array of numbers
n = 10  ; Number of elements in the array
x = 10  ; Lower bound for random numbers
y = 100 ; Upper bound for random numbers
a = randomu(seed, n)* (y-x) + x  ; Creating array with random numbers in given bounds
 
; Now, calculate the sum of the array elements 
sum = 0.0  ; Initialize sum variable
for i=0, n-1 do begin  ; Loop through array elements
    sum = sum + a[i]  ; Add each element to sum
endfor
 
; Finally, calculate the average by dividing sum by number of elements
average = sum / n  
print, "The average of the set of numbers is: ", average  ; Print the result
