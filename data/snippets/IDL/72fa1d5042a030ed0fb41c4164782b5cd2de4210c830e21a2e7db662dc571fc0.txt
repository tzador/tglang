;; This code snippet calculates the sum of the first 10 numbers
PRO calculate_sum, n

  ;; Define variables
  n = 10 ;; Number of terms to be summed
  sum = 0 ;; Starting value of sum variable

  ;; Create a loop to iterate over each term
  FOR i = 1, n DO BEGIN
    sum = sum + i ;; Add current term to the sum
  ENDfor

  ;; Print the final sum
  PRINT, "The sum of the first 10 numbers is: ", sum

END

;; Call the function to calculate the sum
