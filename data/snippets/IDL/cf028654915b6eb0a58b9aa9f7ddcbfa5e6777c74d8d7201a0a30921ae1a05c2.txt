; This line checks if the absolute difference between x and y is less than 1e-10 (a very small number).
; This is our stopping condition for finding the fixed point.
      f = x
; If the stopping condition is met, the function will return the current value of x as the fixed point.
   else
; If the stopping condition is not met, the function will continue to iterate.
      x = y
; The current value of y is assigned to x for the next iteration.
      y = function_evaluate(x)
; This line calls the function_evaluate procedure to evaluate the given function at the current value of x.
; The result is assigned to y, which will be used in the next iteration.
      f = fix_point(x, y)
; This line calls the fix_point procedure recursively, with the new values of x and y.
; This process continues until the stopping condition is met.
