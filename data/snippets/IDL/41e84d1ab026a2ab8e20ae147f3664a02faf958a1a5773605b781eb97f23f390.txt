; This is a program to calculate the standard deviation 
; and variance of a given array of numbers in IDL

; Create a procedure called 'stats' that takes in the array of numbers as an argument

PRO stats, array

; Initialize variables to store the sum and sum of squares
total = 0
total_sq = 0

; Loop through the array and calculate the sum and sum of squares
FOR i = 0, N_Elements(array) - 1 DO BEGIN
	total = total + array[i]
	total_sq = total_sq + array[i]^2
ENDFOR

; Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
mean = total / N_Elements(array)

; Calculate the variance by subtracting the mean from each element, squaring the result, 
; and then dividing by the number of elements in the array
variance = total_sq / N_Elements(array) - mean^2

; Calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance
deviation = Sqrt(variance)

; Print out the results
PRINT, "Mean: " + StrTrunc(mean,2)
PRINT, "Variance: " + StrTrunc(variance,2)
PRINT, "Standard Deviation: " + StrTrunc(deviation,2)

; End of procedure
END

; Create an array of numbers to test the 'stats' procedure
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

; Call the procedure and pass in the array as an argument
