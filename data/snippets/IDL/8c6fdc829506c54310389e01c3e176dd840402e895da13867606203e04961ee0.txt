;; This is a comment in IDL
;; Declare a variable of type integer called 'num'
num : int

;; Initialize the variable to 10
num = 10

;; Create an array of integers with 5 elements
array : int[5]

;; Use a for loop to assign values to the array
for i = 0, 4 do begin
    ;; Multiply the index by 2 and assign it to the current element
    array[i] = i * 2
endfor

;; Print out the values in the array
printf, "Values in the array: "
for i = 0, 4 do printf, string(array[i]) + " "
printf, "\n"

;; Define a function that checks if a number is prime
;; Takes in one parameter, the number to be checked
function is_prime(number)

    ;; Initialize a variable to keep track of prime status
    prime : int
    prime = 1

    ;; Check if number is divisible by any number less than itself
    ;; If it is, set prime variable to 0
    for i = 2, number-1 do begin
        if(number mod i eq 0) then prime = 0
    endfor

    ;; Return the prime status
    return prime

endfunction

;; Call the is_prime function and store the result in a variable
result : int
result = is_prime(13)

;; Print out the result
if(result eq 1) then printf, "Number is prime\n"
else printf, "Number is not prime\n"
