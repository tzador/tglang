oStack = Obj_New('IDLgrStack') ; Create a new graphics stack object
; Set up the underlying "scene" for the stack â€” the one that is "pushed" as a block onto the stack:

oScene = Obj_New('IDLgrScene') ;Create new scene object
oSurface = Obj_New('IDLgrSurface') ;Create new surface object
oDupConts = Obj_New() ;Create new duplicate container

oDupConts->Add, oSurface ;Add the surface to the duplicate container
oScene->Add, oDupConts ;Add the duplicate container to the scene

oStack->Push, oScene ;Push the scene onto the stack

; Set up a new scene to render "on top of" the one in the stack:
oScene = Obj_New('IDLgrScene')
oSurface = Obj_New('IDLgrSurface')

oScene->Add, oSurface

; Set the color of the surface to red:
oSurface.color = [255, 0, 0]

; Push this scene onto the stack
oStack->Push, oScene

; Now we have two levels on the stack, with a red surface on top
; To draw the scene, call the Draw method of the top scene:
oStack->Top->Draw
