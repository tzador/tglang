PRO calculate_dist, x, y, n
; This program calculates the distance between the first n points 
; in a set of Cartesian coordinates (x,y).

; Define variables
npoints = n

dist_sum = 0.0

; Calculate distance between points
for i=0, npoints-1 do begin
    for j=0, npoints-1 do begin
        dx = abs(x[i] - x[j]) ; x distance
        dy = abs(y[i] - y[j]) ; y distance
        dist_array[i,j] = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2) ; distance formula
    endfor

; Sum the distances
for i=0, npoints-1 do begin
    for j=0, npoints-1 do begin
        dist_sum += dist_array[i,j]

; Print the results
print, 'The sum of distances between the first ' + strtrim(npoints,2) + ' points is = ', dist_sum

; Return the sum of distances
