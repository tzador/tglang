;This is a complex function that calculates the covariance matrix of a given dataset
 function calculate_covariance_matrix(data)
 STOP = N_ELEMENTS(data) ;determines the number of elements in the dataset
 covariance_matrix = MAKE_ARRAY(STOP, STOP) ;creates an empty array for the covariance matrix
 for i=0, STOP-1 do begin
   for j=0, STOP-1 do begin
     x = data[i] ;selects the i-th element of the dataset
     y = data[j] ;selects the j-th element of the dataset
     xy = x*y ;multiplies the two selected values
     mean_x = MEAN(data) ;calculates the mean of the dataset
     mean_y = MEAN(data) ;calculates the mean of the dataset
     diff_x = x - mean_x ;calculates the difference between x and the mean
     diff_y = y - mean_y ;calculates the difference between y and the mean
     diff_xy = diff_x * diff_y ;multiplies the two differences
     sum_xy = TOTAL(data, xy) ;calculates the sum of all xy values
     sum_diff_xy = TOTAL(data, diff_xy) ;calculates the sum of all difference of xy values
     covariance_matrix[i,j] = sum_diff_xy/(STOP-1) ;calculates and assigns the covariance value in the matrix
