; This is a snippet of IDL code that demonstrates the use of a subroutine and a for loop

pro test_sub

  ; Declaration of variables 
  a = 1
  b = 4
  sum = 0

  ; For loop to iterate through values of a
  for i=0, a do begin
  
    ; Call subroutine to calculate sum of a and b
    test_add, a, b, sum

    ; Print the current values of a, b, and sum
    print, "Iteration: ", i
    print, "A: ", a
    print, "B: ", b
    print, "Sum: ", sum
  endfor

end

; Subroutine definition
pro test_add, a, b, sum

  ; Add values of a and b and store result in sum
  sum = a + b

  ; Print the values of a and b that were passed into the subroutine
  print, "A (inside subroutine): ", a
  print, "B (inside subroutine): ", b
  print, "Sum (inside subroutine): ", sum
