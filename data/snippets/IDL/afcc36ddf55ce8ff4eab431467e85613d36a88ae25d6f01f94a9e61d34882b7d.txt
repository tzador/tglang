;; Define a function for calculating the factorial of a given number
function factorial, n

;; Define the local variable to store the result
result = 1

;; Loop through the numbers from n to 1 and multiply them
for i = n, 1, -1 do begin
    result = result * i
endfor

;; Return the factorial result
return, result
