;; Define a function called 'calculate_square' that takes in two arguments 'x' and 'y'
FUNCTION calculate_square, x, y

;; Calculate the square of 'x' and store it in a variable called 'square_x'
square_x = x^2

;; Calculate the square of 'y' and store it in a variable called 'square_y'
square_y = y^2

;; Calculate the sum of 'square_x' and 'square_y'
sum = square_x + square_y

;; Return the sum as the output of the function
RETURN, sum

;; Call the function and assign the output to a variable called 'result'
result = calculate_square(3, 4)

;; Print the value of 'result' to the screen
PRINT, result
