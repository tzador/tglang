; Define a structure
struct = {name:string, age:integer, occupation:string}

; Create an array of structures
people = [{name:"John", age:32, occupation:"Engineer"}, {name:"Emily", age:28, occupation:"Teacher"}, {name:"Mike", age:45, occupation:"Writer"}]

; Create a function to calculate the average age of people in the array
function calculateAverageAge(people)
begin
    ; Define variables
    totalAge = 0
    numPeople = numberofElements(people)

    ; Loop through array and add up ages
    for i=0, numPeople-1 do begin
        totalAge = totalAge + people[i].age
    endfor

    ; Calculate and return average age
    return totalAge / numPeople
end

; Call the function and print the result
printf, "The average age of people is: %d", calculateAverageAge(people)
