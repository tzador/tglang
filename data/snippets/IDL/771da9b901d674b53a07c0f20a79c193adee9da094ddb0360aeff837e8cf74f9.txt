  ;; n: integer input for number of sequence elements

  ;; Created by: John Smith on 9/21/2021
  ;; Example usage: fibonacci, 10

  if n le 0 then begin
    print, "n must be a positive nonzero integer."
    return
  endif

  ;; Initialize variables
  integer :: i, sequence(2:n)

  ;; Set first two elements of sequence
  sequence(0) = 0
  sequence(1) = 1

  ;; Loop through remaining elements
  for i=2, n-1 do begin
    ;; Calculate the next element in the sequence
    sequence(i) = sequence(i-1) + sequence(i-2)
  endfor

  ;; Print results
  print, "Fibonacci sequence up to", n, "numbers:"
  print, sequence
