; This is a code snippet in IDL that creates a 2D matrix and performs a series of operations on it
; Define the size of the matrix
dimx = 10 
dimy = 10

; Create a 2D matrix called "myMatrix" with dimensions defined above
myMatrix = fltarr(dimx, dimy)

; Populate the matrix with random numbers between 0 and 1
myMatrix = randomu(seed, dimx, dimy)

; Print out the matrix before any operations
print, myMatrix

; Perform a series of operations on the matrix
; Multiply each element in the matrix by 2
myMatrix = myMatrix * 2
; Add 5 to each element in the matrix
myMatrix = myMatrix + 5
; Take the square root of each element in the matrix
myMatrix = sqrt(myMatrix)
; Take the cosine of each element in the matrix
myMatrix = cos(myMatrix)
; Take the sum of each row in the matrix
rowsum = total(myMatrix, /row)
; Take the sum of each column in the matrix
colsum = total(myMatrix, /column)

; Print out the matrix after all operations
print, myMatrix

; Print out the sum of each row and column
print, rowsum, colsum
