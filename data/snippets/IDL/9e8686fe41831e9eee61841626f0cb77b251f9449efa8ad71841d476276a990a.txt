pro calculate_factorial, number
;; This is a procedure that takes in a number and calculates its factorial
;; Input:
;;  number: number for which the factorial needs to be calculated (integer)
;;
;; Output:
;;  result: factorial of the given number (integer)
 
	;; Check for invalid input
	if number lt 0 then begin
		print, 'Error: factorial not defined for negative numbers'
		;; This is a built-in function in IDL which prints the given string
		result = -1
		return, result

	;; Initialize a counter variable and the result
	i = 1
	result = 1
 
	;; Loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number
	while (i le number) do begin
		result = result * i
		i = i + 1
	endwhile
 
	;; Print the result
	print, 'The factorial of ' + strtrim(number, 2) + ' is: ' + strtrim(result, 2)
 
	;; Return the result
	return, result
