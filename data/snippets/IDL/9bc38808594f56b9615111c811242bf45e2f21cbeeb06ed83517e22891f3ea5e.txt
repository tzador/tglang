; This code defines a procedure called "calculate" and takes two input parameters x and y
pro calculate, x, y
  ;; Declare local variables
  variable a, b, c

  ;; Calculate the sum of x and y
  a = x + y

  ;; Calculate the product of x and y
  b = x * y

  ;; Calculate the difference of x and y
  c = x - y
  
  ;; Output results in console
  print, "Sum of x and y is:", a
  print, "Product of x and y is:", b
  print, "Difference of x and y is:", c

end
