; This is an example of a function in IDL that calculates the correlation coefficient.

function corr_coefficient, x, y
; Function to calculate the correlation coefficient between two input arrays x and y.
;
; Inputs:
;    x - first input array
;    y - second input array
;
; Returns:
;    r - correlation coefficient between x and y
;
; Written by John Smith, University of XYZ

; Calculate mean of x and y
mean_x = mean(x)
mean_y = mean(y)

; Calculate deviations from mean
dev_x = x - mean_x
dev_y = y - mean_y

; Calculate sum of squares of deviations
sum_dev_x = total(dev_x^2)
sum_dev_y = total(dev_y^2)

; Calculate sum of products of deviations
sum_prod_dev = total(dev_x*dev_y)

; Calculate correlation coefficient
r = sum_prod_dev / sqrt(sum_dev_x*sum_dev_y)

; Return the correlation coefficient
return, r
