; This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
FUNCTION FACTORIAL, n
   ; Declare the local variables
   a = 1L ; Integer type
   i = 1L ; Integer type
   ; Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
   FOR i=1L, n DO BEGIN
      ; Multiply the current value of a with the current value of i
      a *= i
   ENDFOR
   ; Return the final value of a as the factorial of n
   RETURN, a
END
