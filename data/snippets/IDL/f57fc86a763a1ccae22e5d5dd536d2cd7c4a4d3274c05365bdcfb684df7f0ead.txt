;; This code snippet calculates the mean and standard deviation of a given array of numbers
;;

;; Define the array of numbers
arr = [1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8, 9.0, 2.3, 4.5, 6.7, 8.9, 10.1]

;; Define the variables to hold the sum of array elements and their squared values
sum = 0.0
sumsq = 0.0

;; Loop through the array and add each element to the sum
FOR i = 0, 9 DO BEGIN
    sum = sum + arr[i]
ENDFOR

;; Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the number of elements
mean = sum / 10.0

;; Loop through the array again and add the squared values to the sumsq variable
FOR i = 0, 9 DO BEGIN
    sumsq = sumsq + arr[i]^2
ENDFOR

;; Calculate the variance by subtracting the mean from each element, squaring the result, and then dividing by the number of elements
variance = (sumsq - 10.0*(mean)^2) / 10.0

;; Calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance
stddev = SQRT(variance)

;; Print the results
PRINT, "The mean of the array is: ", mean
PRINT, "The standard deviation of the array is: ", stddev
