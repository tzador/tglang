pro mean, data, n
;This is a pro (procedure) to calculate the mean of a given dataset
;Inputs:
;data - the dataset to be analyzed
;n - the number of data points in the dataset
;Output:
;mean - the calculated mean of the dataset
;
;First, initialize a variable for the sum of the dataset
sum = 0.0
;Loop through the dataset and add each data point to the sum
for i=0, n-1 do begin
sum = sum + data[i]
endfor
;Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the total number of data points
mean = sum / n
;Print the mean to the console
print, 'The mean of the dataset is: ', mean
