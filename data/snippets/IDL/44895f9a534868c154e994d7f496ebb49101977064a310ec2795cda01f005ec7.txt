;; This code calculates the mean and standard deviation of an array of numbers

;; Define the array of numbers
numbers = [12, 34, 56.7, 8.1, 90, 21, 33.8, 10.2, 5, 19.6]

;; Calculate the mean
sum = 0.0
for i=0, np-1 do begin
    sum += numbers[i]
endfor
mean = sum/np

;; Calculate the standard deviation
sum = 0.0
for i=0, np-1 do begin
    sum += (numbers[i]-mean)^2
endfor
std = sqrt(sum/(np-1))

;; Print the results
print, 'The mean is ', mean
print, 'The standard deviation is ', std
