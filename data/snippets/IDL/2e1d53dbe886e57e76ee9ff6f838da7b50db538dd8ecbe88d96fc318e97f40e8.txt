;; This is a function in IDL that calculates the distance between two points
FUNCTION DISTANCE, x1, y1, x2, y2
   ;; Calculate the difference in x coordinates
   dx = x2 - x1

   ;; Calculate the difference in y coordinates
   dy = y2 - y1

   ;; Calculate the distance using the Pythagorean theorem
   dist = SQRT(dx^2 + dy^2)

   ;; Return the distance
   RETURN, dist
