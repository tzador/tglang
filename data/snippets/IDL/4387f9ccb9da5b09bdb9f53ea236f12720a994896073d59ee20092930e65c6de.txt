;; Generate a random normal distribution with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10
DATA = RANDOMU(seed, 1000) ; initialize 1000 random numbers between 0 and 1
DIST = 50 + 10*SQR(-2*ALOG(1-DATA)) * COS(2*!PI*DATA) ; apply Box-Muller transform
DIST = (DIST - MEAN(DIST)) / STDDEV(DIST) ; normalize to desired mean and standard deviation
PLOT, DIST, /HISTOGRAM, TITLE='Random Normal Distribution' ; plot data as histogram
X = DIST
Y = 1/sqrt(2*!PI*10^2) * EXP(-(X-50)^2 / (2*10^2)) ; calculate theoretical normal distribution curve
OPLOT, X, Y, LINESTYLE=2, COLOR='red' ; overlay theoretical curve on histogram plot
