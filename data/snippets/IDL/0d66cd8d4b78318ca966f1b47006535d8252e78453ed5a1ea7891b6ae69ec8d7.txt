; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion

FUNCTION factorial, x

; Define the function 'factorial' which takes in the input parameter 'x'

IF x EQ 0 THEN BEGIN

; Checks if the input parameter is equal to 0

	RETURN, 1

; If the input is 0, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is defined as 1

ENDIF ELSE BEGIN

; If the input is not equal to 0, execute the following block of code

	RETURN, x * factorial(x - 1)

; This line calls the function 'factorial' again with the parameter x-1 until the base case is reached, then multiplies the result by x

; In this way, recursion is used to calculate the factorial of x

END
