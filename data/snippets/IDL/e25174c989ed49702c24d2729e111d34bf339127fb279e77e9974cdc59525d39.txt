pro test, a, b, c
; This is a procedure called 'test' with three input parameters, all denoted by the datatype 'a'
; The first input parameter is 'a', the second is 'b', and the third is 'c'
; The purpose of this procedure is unknown, but it requires three input parameters
  a = b + c    ; This statement assigns the sum of 'b' and 'c' to the variable 'a'
  b = 2 * a    ; This statement assigns twice the value of 'a' to the variable 'b'
  c = a * b    ; This statement assigns the product of 'a' and 'b' to the variable 'c'
  print, 'a = ', a    ; This statement prints the value of 'a'
  print, 'b = ', b    ; This statement prints the value of 'b'
  print, 'c = ', c    ; This statement prints the value of 'c'
