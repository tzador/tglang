### This code snippet creates a variable and performs a series of operations on it

pro sample_code

  ; Define the variable "a" as an array of integers
  a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  ; Print the variable to the console
  print, a

  ; Create a new variable by doubling each element in "a"
  b = a * 2

  ; Add 10 to each element in "a" and store the result in variable "c"
  c = a + 10
  
  ; Create a variable to keep track of the sum of elements in "a"
  sum = 0

  ; Use a for loop to iterate through "a" and continuously add each element to "sum"
  for i=0, n_elements(a)-1 do begin
    sum = sum + a[i]
  endfor

  ; Print the final sum
  print, sum

end
