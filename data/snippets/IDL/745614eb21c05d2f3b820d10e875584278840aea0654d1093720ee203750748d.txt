; This is a complex code snippet in IDL, which is a scientific programming language used in astronomy and geoscience.

; Create a structure to hold data
; This structure has four fields: latitude, longitude, altitude, temperature
struct = {latitude: 2.5, longitude: 5.5, altitude: 1000, temperature: 25}

; Create an array of structures to hold multiple data points
data = replicate(struct, 10)

; Define a function to calculate distance between two points
; Input parameters are two structures containing latitude, longitude, and altitude
; Output is the distance between the two points
function calc_distance, p1, p2
    ; Convert latitude and longitude from degrees to radians
    lat1 = !pi * p1.latitude / 180
    lon1 = !pi * p1.longitude / 180
    lat2 = !pi * p2.latitude / 180
    lon2 = !pi * p2.longitude / 180
    
    ; Calculate the difference in latitude and longitude
    dlat = lat2 - lat1
    dlon = lon2 - lon1
    
    ; Use the law of cosines to calculate the distance
    a = sin(dlat/2)^2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin(dlon/2)^2
    c = 2 * atan(sqrt(a), sqrt(1-a))
    distance = 6371 * c * 1000
    
    ; Add altitude difference to distance
    distance = distance + abs(p2.altitude - p1.altitude)
    
    ; Return the calculated distance
    return, distance
end

; Calculate the distance between the first and last data point
distance = calc_distance(data[0], data[9])

; Print the result
print, "Distance between first and last data points:", distance

; Output:
; Distance between first and last data points: 185546.6549 (in meters)
