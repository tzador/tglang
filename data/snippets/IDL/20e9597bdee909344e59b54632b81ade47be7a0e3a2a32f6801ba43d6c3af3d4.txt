    ;; Check the employee's department and use the bonus amount from the dictionary
    bonus_amount = bonus_dict[employee.department]
    
    ;; Calculate the bonus based on the employee's salary
    bonus = (bonus_amount * employee.salary) / 100
    
    ;; Print out the employee's bonus information
    print, "Employee Name: " + employee.employee_name
