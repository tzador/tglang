; Declare variables:
a : FLOAT	; variable to store real numbers
b : INT		; variable to store integer values
c : STR		; variable to store string values
d : ARR		; variable to store arrays

; Assign values to variables:
a = 5.0		; assign a float value of 5.0 to variable a
b = 10		; assign an integer value of 10 to variable b
c = "Hello"	; assign a string value of "Hello" to variable c

; Use built-in functions and operations:
a = acos(0.5)			; assign the arccosine of 0.5 to variable a
d = [1, 2, 3]			; assign array [1, 2, 3] to variable d
b = min(d)				; assign the minimum value in array d to variable b
d = d * 2				; multiply each element in array d by 2
c = c + " world!"		; concatenate " world!" to the end of string c

; Use conditional statements:
if (a > b) then begin			; if a is greater than b
	print, "a is greater than b"	; print string "a is greater than b"
endif else begin				; else if a is not greater than b
	print, "a is not greater than b" 	; print string "a is not greater than b"
endelse

; Use loops:
for i=0, 2 do begin		; for loop with i starting at 0 and ending at 2
	print, d[i]			; print element i of array d
endfor

; Define and use functions:
function multiply, x, y		; define function multiply with inputs x and y
	return, x * y				; return the product of x and y
endfunction

; Call functions and use in assignment:
c = multiply(a, b)			; assign the product of a and b to variable c
print, c					; print the value of c
