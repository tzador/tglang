; Define a function called "find_max", which takes in an array of numbers called "arr"
FUNCTION find_max, arr
  ; Initialize max value as first element in array
  max = arr[0]
  ; Loop through the rest of the array
  FOR i=1, N_ELEMENTS(arr)-1 DO BEGIN
    ; Check if current element is greater than current max
    IF (arr[i] GT max) THEN BEGIN
      ; If so, update max value
      max = arr[i]
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
  ; Return the maximum value
  RETURN, max
END

; Define a variable called "numbers" which is an array of numbers
numbers = [5, 3, 9, 2, 7, 1]

; Call the "find_max" function with the "numbers" array as an argument
; and store the returned maximum value in a variable called "result"
result = find_max(numbers)

; Print the result to the console
PRINT, "The maximum value is: ", result

; The result should be 9
