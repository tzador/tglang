; This code snippet shows how to calculate the derivative of a given function using the central difference method

; Declare variables
x = 2.0          ; starting value for x
dx = 0.1         ; step size for calculating derivative
f = sin(x)       ; define function f(x) = sin(x)
x1 = x - dx      ; calculate x1 for central difference
x2 = x + dx      ; calculate x2 for central difference

; Use central difference method to estimate derivative of f(x)
dfdx = (f(x2) - f(x1)) / (2.0 * dx)

; Print result
print, "The derivative of sin(x) at x = 2.0 is: ", dfdx
