; Declares a function called 'calculate_average' that takes in two parameters, 'arr' and 'num'
function calculate_average(arr, num)

; Initializes a variable called 'total' and sets it equal to 0
total = 0 ;

; Loops through each element in the array 'arr'
for i=0, num-1 do begin

; Adds the value of each element to the 'total' variable
total = total + arr[i]

; Closes the for loop
endfor

; Divides the 'total' by the number of elements in 'arr' to calculate the average
average = total / num

; Prints out the calculated average
print, "The average of the array is: ", average

; Ends the function declaration
end

; Defines an array called 'numbers' with 5 elements
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

; Calls the 'calculate_average' function and passes in 'numbers' as the 'arr' parameter
calculate_average(numbers, 5)
