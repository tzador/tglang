pro structure, asteroid, dist, velocity
; This program defines a structure for an asteroid and calculates its distance and velocity
; Inputs:
;   asteroid - the name of the asteroid
;   dist - distance from Earth in AU
;   velocity - velocity in km/s
; Output:
;   asteroid_info - a structure containing the asteroid name, distance, and velocity
  struct = {asteroid: "", distance: 0.0, velocity: 0.0} ; define asteroid_info structure

  struct.asteroid = asteroid ; assign asteroid name to structure
  struct.distance = dist ; assign distance to structure
  struct.velocity = velocity ; assign velocity to structure

  print, "Asteroid Name: ", struct.asteroid ; print asteroid name
  print, "Distance from Earth (AU): ", struct.distance ; print distance
  print, "Velocity (km/s): ", struct.velocity ; print velocity
end
