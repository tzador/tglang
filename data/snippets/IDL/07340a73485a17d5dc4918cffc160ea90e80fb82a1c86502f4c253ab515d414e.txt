; Define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
FUNCTION factorial, n

; Initialize the result variable to 1
result = 1

; Loop from 1 to n and multiply the current number with the result
FOR i=1, n DO BEGIN
  result = result * i
ENDFOR

; Return the result
RETURN, result
 
; Define a variable to store the user input
num = 5

; Call the factorial function and store the result in a variable
fact = factorial(num)

; Print the result using the built-in print function
PRINT, "Factorial of ", num, " is: ", fact
