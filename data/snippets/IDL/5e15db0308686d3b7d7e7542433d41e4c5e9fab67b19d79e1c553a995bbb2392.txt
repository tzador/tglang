;
; This is a code snippet that calculates the root mean square of a
; given array of numbers
;
; First, we define the function with its input parameters
; Parameters:
; - numbers: An array of numbers to be calculated
; Returns:
; - rms: the root mean square of the array
;
function root_mean_square(numbers)
    ;
    ; Declare the variables to be used in calculations
    ;
    double precision sum, mean, rms                  ; Declaring floating point variables
    integer count, i                                 ; Declaring integer variables
    ;
    ; Calculate the sum of the numbers in the array
    ;
    sum = 0.0                                        ; Initialize sum variable to 0
    count = n_elements(numbers)                      ; Get the number of elements in the array
    ;
    ; Loop through the array and add up all the numbers
    ;
    for i = 0L, count-1 do begin                     ; Loop over every element in the array
        sum = sum + numbers[i]                       ; Add the current element to the sum
    endfor
    ;
    ; Calculate the mean of the numbers in the array
    ;
    mean = sum / count                              ; Divide the sum by the number of elements
    ;
    ; Calculate the sum of squares of the differences between each number and the mean
    ;
    sum = 0.0                                        ; Reuse the sum variable and initialize it to 0
    for i = 0L, count-1 do begin                     ; Loop over every element in the array
        sum = sum + (numbers[i] - mean)^2            ; Calculate the square of (x - mean) and add to sum
    endfor
    ;
    ; Calculate the root mean square and return as output
    ;
    rms = sqrt(sum / count)                          ; Take the square root of (sum / count)
    return, rms                                      ; Return the root mean square value
