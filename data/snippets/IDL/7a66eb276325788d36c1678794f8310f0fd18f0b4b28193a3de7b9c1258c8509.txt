;;; Function to calculate the volume of a sphere

function calc_volume, radius

;;; Description: Calculates the volume of a sphere based on its radius.

;;; Input:
;;;     radius: The radius of the sphere.

;;; Output:
;;;     volume: The calculated volume of the sphere.

;;; Example:
;;;   Calculates the volume of a sphere with a radius of 5 units:
;;;     volume = calc_volume(5)

begin

	; Define the constant for pi
	pi = 3.141593

	; Calculate the volume using the formula V = (4/3) * pi * r^3
	volume = (4/3) * pi * radius^3

	; Return the calculated volume
	return, volume
