;; This code snippet defines a function that calculates the average of a given array of numbers
;; Input: array of numbers
;; Output: average of numbers
function calc_average(numbers) {
  ;; Define variables
  total = 0  ;; sum of numbers
  num_count = 0  ;; number of numbers in array

  ;; Loop through array and add each number to total
  for i=0, i<numbers.length, i++ do begin
    total = total + numbers[i]
    num_count = num_count + 1
  endfor

  ;; Calculate average by dividing total by number count
  average = total / num_count

  ;; Print result
  print, "The average is: ", average

  ;; Return average as output
  return average

end
