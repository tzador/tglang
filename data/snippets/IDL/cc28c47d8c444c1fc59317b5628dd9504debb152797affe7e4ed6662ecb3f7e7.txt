;; This program calculates the average of a given list of integers
;; and returns the value with 2 decimal places.

;; Declare and initialize the list of integers
list = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

;; Initialize the sum and count variables
sum = 0
count = 0

;; Loop through each integer in the list
FOR i=0, N_ELEMENTS(list)-1 DO BEGIN

  ;; Add the current integer to the sum variable
  sum += list[i]

  ;; Increment the count variable
  count += 1

ENDFOR

;; Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count
avg = sum / count

;; Format the average to 2 decimal places
avg2 = STRING(avg, FORMAT='(F2.0)')

;; Print the average
PRINT, 'The average of the given list is: ', avg2
