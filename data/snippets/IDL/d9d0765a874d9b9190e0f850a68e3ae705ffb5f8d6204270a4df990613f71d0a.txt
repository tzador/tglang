PROGA ESXCONT(node,edge)
; This program takes as input a graph with nodes and edges
; and computes the average shortest path between all pairs of nodes. 
; It uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to efficiently 
; compute the shortest path matrix. 

; Initialize number of nodes and edges
nnodes = LEN(node)
nedges = LEN(edge)

; Initialize shortest path matrix with maximum possible value
dist = REPLICATE(1E10, nnodes, nnodes)

; Fill in distance matrix with edge weights
FOR i = 0, nedges-1 DO BEGIN
    dist[edge[i,0], edge[i,1]] = edge[i,2]
ENDFOR

; Use Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute shortest paths
FOR k = 0, nnodes-1 DO BEGIN
    FOR i = 0, nnodes-1 DO BEGIN
        FOR j = 0, nnodes-1 DO BEGIN
            dist[i, j] = MIN(dist[i, j], dist[i, k] + dist[k, j])
        ENDFOR
    ENDFOR
ENDFOR

; Compute average shortest path distance
avg_dist = 0.0
FOR i = 0, nnodes-1 DO BEGIN
    FOR j = 0, nnodes-1 DO BEGIN
        avg_dist = avg_dist + dist[i, j]
    ENDFOR
ENDFOR
avg_dist = avg_dist / (nnodes * (nnodes-1))

; Print out results
PRINT, "The average shortest path distance is:", avg_dist
