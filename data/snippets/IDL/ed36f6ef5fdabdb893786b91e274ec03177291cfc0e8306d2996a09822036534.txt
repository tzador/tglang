pro simple_linear_regression, x, y, slope, intercept
; This is a procedure that performs simple linear regression
; Input Parameters:
;	x: input x values
;	y: input y values
; Output Parameters:
;	slope: slope of the regression line
;	intercept: y-intercept of the regression line

; Compute mean of x and y
mx = mean(x)
my = mean(y)

; Compute the deviations from mean for x and y
dx = x - mx
dy = y - my

; Compute sum of products and sum of squares of the deviations
sum_prod = total(dx*dy)
sum_sq = total(dx^2)

; Calculate slope and intercept
slope = sum_prod / sum_sq
intercept = my - slope*mx

; Print results
print, 'Slope: ', slope
print, 'Intercept: ', intercept
