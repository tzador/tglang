; The following is a code snippet in the programming language IDL
; It is a function that calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two arrays of values
; The output should be the calculated correlation coefficient

FUNCTION pearson_coefficient, x, y

  ; First, calculate the mean of both arrays
  x_mean = mean(x)
  y_mean = mean(y)

  ; Next, calculate the standard deviation of both arrays
  x_std = stddev(x)
  y_std = stddev(y)

  ; Now, calculate the covariance between the two arrays
  covariance = covariance(x, y)

  ; Finally, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient
  pearson_coefficient = covariance / (x_std * y_std)

  ; Return the calculated value
  RETURN, pearson_coefficient
