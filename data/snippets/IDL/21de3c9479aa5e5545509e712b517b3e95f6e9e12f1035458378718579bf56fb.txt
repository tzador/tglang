;; This code snippet is an IDL program that generates a 2D sinusoidal signal with noise
;; It uses various built-in IDL functions to create the signal and add noise to it
;; The output is plotted using a built-in IDL function
 
;; Define parameters for the signal
amplitude = 10.0 ;; Amplitude of the sinusoidal signal
frequency = 5.0 ;; Frequency of the signal
phase = 0.5 ;; Phase of the signal
 
;; Create a vector of time values, starting from 0 and ending at 100 with a step size of 0.5
time = findgen(201) * 0.5
 
;; Generate the sinusoidal signal using the parameters defined above
signal = amplitude * sin(2.0 * !pi * frequency * time + phase)
 
;; Add random Gaussian noise to the signal using the IDL function RANDOMN
noise = randomn(seed=1234, 201) ;; 201 is the same size as the time vector and sets the seed to ensure replicability
 
;; Add the noise to the signal
noisy_signal = signal + noise
 
;; Plot the noisy signal using the built-in IDL function PLOT
plot, time, noisy_signal
 
;; Add labels and a title to the plot 
xlabel = "Time (seconds)"
ylabel = "Signal Amplitude"
title = "2D Sinusoidal Signal with Noise"
 
;; Set the plot properties using keyword arguments in the PLOT function
plot, time, noisy_signal, xlabel=xlabel, ylabel=ylabel, title=title
