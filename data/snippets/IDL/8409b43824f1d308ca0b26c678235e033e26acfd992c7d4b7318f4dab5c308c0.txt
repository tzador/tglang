PRO procedure_name, arg1, arg2
  ;This procedure takes in two arguments, arg1 and arg2
  ;and performs a complex calculation
  ;This is another comment in IDL
  
  ;Defining variables
  x = arg1
  y = arg2
  z = 0

  ;Integrate using Simpson's rule
  FOR i = 0, n-1 DO BEGIN
    z = z + (x[i] + 4*y[i] + x[i+1])*dx/6.0
  ENDFOR

  ;Computing the mean and standard deviation
  mean = total(z)/n
  std_dev = sqrt(total(z^2 - mean^2)/(n-1))

  ;Printing the results
  PRINT, "The mean is ", mean
  PRINT, "The standard deviation is ", std_dev
