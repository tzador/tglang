;; This is a comments section in IDL
;; This code snippet creates a function that calculates the slope
;; between two points given their x and y coordinates as inputs
PRO calculateSlope, x1, y1, x2, y2
    ;; Initializing variables
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1

    ;; Calculating slope
    slope = dy/dx
