; Define a function to calculate the average of two numbers 
pro calculate_average, x, y  

; Declare the input variables 
  xInput = x  
  yInput = y  

; Calculate the sum of the two numbers 
  sum = xInput + yInput

; Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 2
  average = sum / 2  

; Print the calculated average to the screen 
  print, 'The average of ', xInput, ' and ', yInput, ' is ', average  

; End the function  
end
