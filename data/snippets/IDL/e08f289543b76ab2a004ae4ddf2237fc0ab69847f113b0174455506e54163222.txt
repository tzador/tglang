; This code snippet shows an example of a function that calculates the area of a rectangle
; Declaring a function to calculate the area with two parameters, length and width
FUNCTION CalculateArea, length, width
; Using the following formula to calculate the area: area = length * width
  area = length * width
; Returning the calculated area
  RETURN, area
; End of function
END

; Declaring variables for length and width of rectangle
length = 5.6
width = 3.2
; Calling the function and passing the variables as arguments
area = CalculateArea(length, width)
; Printing the calculated area to the screen
PRINT, 'The area of a rectangle with length ' + length + ' and width ' + width + ' is ' + area
