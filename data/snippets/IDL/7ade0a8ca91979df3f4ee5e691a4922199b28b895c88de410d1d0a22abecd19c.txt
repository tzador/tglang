; Define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number 
FUNCTION factorial, num

  ; Initialize factorial and counter variables
  factorial = 1L 
  counter = 1L 

  ; Multiply factorial by counter until counter reaches num
  WHILE (counter <= num) DO BEGIN 
    factorial = factorial * counter 
    counter = counter + 1 
  ENDFOR 

  ; Return the factorial value
  RETURN, factorial 
END 

; Call the factorial function with a value of 5 
factorialValue = factorial(5) 

; Print the result 
PRINT, 'The factorial of 5 is: ', factorialValue 

; Define and initialize a string variable 
stringVar = 'This is a string variable.' 

; Print the string variable 
PRINT, 'The string variable is: ', stringVar 

; Create a structure with three fields: id (integer), name (string), and 
; salary (float)
person = {id: 123, name: 'John Doe', salary: 50000.00} 

; Print the name of the person 
PRINT, 'The name of the person is: ', person.name 

; Calculate the average of two numbers 
averageNum = (10 + 20) / 2 

; Print the average 
PRINT, 'The average of 10 and 20 is: ', averageNum
