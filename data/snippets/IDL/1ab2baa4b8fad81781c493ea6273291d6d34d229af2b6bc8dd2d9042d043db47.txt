; This is a complex code snippet in IDL that shows how to perform image processing on a satellite image.

pro processImage, input_image, output_image

    ; Initialize variables
    width = size(input_image[*,0])
    height = size(input_image[0,*])

    ; Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the image
    mean = mean(input_image)
    std = stddev(input_image)

    ; Apply a filter to the image
    filter = [[0,1,0],[1,4,1],[0,1,0]]
    filtered_image = convol(input_image,filter)

    ; Normalize the image
    normalized_image = (filtered_image - mean) / std

    ; Apply a threshold to the image
    threshold = std * 2
    for i=0,width-1 do begin
        for j=0,height-1 do begin
            if normalized_image[i,j] > threshold then begin
                output_image[i,j] = 255
            endif else begin
                output_image[i,j] = 0
            endelse
        endfor
    endfor

end

; Example usage of the processImage function
img = read_image("satellite_image.png")
out = processImage(img)
write_image(out, "processed_image.png")
