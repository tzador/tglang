;; This program calculates the root mean square error of a set of data
;; Inputs:
;;     data: an array of data values
;;     model: an array of model values
;; Output:
;;     rms: the root mean square error
function rms = calc_rms(data, model)

;; Check the dimensions of the input arrays

;; Loop through each element in the arrays and calculate the difference squared
;; and then add it to the running sum
