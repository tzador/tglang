; This code snippet calculates the mean of a matrix using built-in IDL functions
;
; Declare a 2x3 matrix with random values
matrix = randomu(seed, 2, 3)

; Calculate the sum of all elements in the matrix
sum = total(matrix)

; Get the size of the matrix
size = size(matrix, /DIM)

; Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the size
mean = sum / size

; Print the result
print, mean
