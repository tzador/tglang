PRO mar_fib, n
; Calculates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
; Inputs:
;     n - the number of terms to calculate
; Outputs:
;     fib - an array containing the first n Fibonacci numbers
;
; Example:
;     mar_fib, 6
;     returns: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
fib = fltarr(n) ; initialize an array of length n for the Fibonacci numbers
fib[0] = 0 ; the first term is always 0
fib[1] = 1 ; the second term is always 1
for i=2, n-1 do begin ; start loop at index 2
    fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2] ; calculate the next term by adding the previous two terms
endfor
return, fib ; return the calculated Fibonacci numbers
