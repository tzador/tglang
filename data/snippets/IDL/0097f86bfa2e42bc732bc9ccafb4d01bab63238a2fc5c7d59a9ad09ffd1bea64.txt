;Example of a function that calculates the standard deviation of an array of numbers

function std_deviation(arr)
  ; Define variables for loop and calculations
  n = n_elements(arr)
  sum = 0.0
  mean = 0.0
  
  ; Calculate the mean of the array
  for i=0, n-1 do begin
    sum = sum + arr[i]
  endfor
  mean = sum / n
  
  ; Calculate the sum of the squared differences from the mean
  sum_squares = 0
  for i=0, n-1 do begin
    sum_squares = sum_squares + (arr[i] - mean)^2
  endfor
  
  ; Calculate the standard deviation
  std_dev = sqrt(sum_squares/(n-1))
  
  ; Print result to screen (optional)
  print, "The standard deviation is: ", std_dev
  
  ; Return the standard deviation value
  return, std_dev
end
