; This is a code snippet in an annotated markdown for 'IDL' programming language.
; It assigns four variables of different data types, performs addition and prints the result with a message.

; Declare four variables of different data types
IDL> x = 1        ; integer
IDL> y = 2.5      ; floating point
IDL> str = "Hello"    ; string
IDL> arr = [1, 2, 3]   ; array

; Perform addition with the variables
IDL> result = x + y + arr[0]  ; result will be 4.5

; Print the result with a message
IDL> print, "The result of the addition is: ", result   ; output would be: The result of the addition is: 4.5
