; This code snippet calculates the distance between two points in 3-dimensional space

FUNCTION dist3d, point1, point2
  ; Calculates the distance between two points in 3-dimensional space
  ; Inputs:
  ;   point1: array of three elements representing the x, y, and z coordinates of the first point
  ;   point2: array of three elements representing the x, y, and z coordinates of the second point
  ; Output:
  ;   distance: the distance between the two points
  
  dx = point1[0] - point2[0] ; calculate difference in x coordinates
  dy = point1[1] - point2[1] ; calculate difference in y coordinates
  dz = point1[2] - point2[2] ; calculate difference in z coordinates
  
  distance = SQRT(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) ; calculate the Euclidean distance using Pythagorean theorem
  
  RETURN, distance ; return the distance
END

; Example usage
p1 = [1, 2, 3] ; set coordinates for first point
p2 = [4, 5, 6] ; set coordinates for second point

result = dist3d(p1, p2) ; calculate distance between points

PRINT, 'Distance between points is: ', result ; print the result to the console
