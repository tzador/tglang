; This program calculates the area of a circle given the radius

pro area_circle, radius
;; This is a procedure that takes in a radius and calculates the area of a circle using the formula A = Ï€r^2.
; Input is given as a floating-point number representing the radius.
; The output is a floating-point number representing the area of the circle.

; Set the value of pi as a constant
pi = !PI

; Define the formula for calculating the area of a circle
area = pi * (radius ^ 2)

; Print the result
print, "The area of the circle is: ", area
