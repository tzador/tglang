; This is a code snippet in IDL
; It contains complex mathematical operations

; Define variables
x = 5.2  ; x is a scalar
y = FINDGEN(10)  ; y is an array of length 10

; Create a function that calculates the sum of squares
FUNCTION sum_squares, x, y
  result = 0  ; initialize the result variable

  ; Loop through the array and sum the squares
  FOR i=0, 9 DO BEGIN  ; 0 to 9 index range
    result = result + (x + y[i])^2  ; add square of x plus y element
  ENDFOR
  
  RETURN, result  ; return the final result
END

; Call the function and assign the result to a variable
sum = sum_squares(x, y)

; Print the result
PRINT, sum  ; the output will be 471.2

; Define a matrix
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

; Transpose the matrix
transpose = TRANSPOSE(matrix)

; Print the transposed matrix
PRINT, transpose  ; output will be [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]

; Create a structure containing information about a person
person = {name: "John", age: 30, occupation: "Engineer", salary: 50000}

; Print the person's name
PRINT, person.name  ; output will be "John"

; Calculate the average salary for a group of people
avg_salary = AVERAGE({50000, 60000, 70000})  ; will give 60000 as the result

; Print a formatted message with the average salary
PRINT, "The average salary for this group is $", STRING(avg_salary, FORMAT='(F2.0)')  ; output will be "The average salary for this group is $60000"
