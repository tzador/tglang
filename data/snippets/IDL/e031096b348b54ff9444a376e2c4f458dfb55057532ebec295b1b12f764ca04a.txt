PRO myprog, X, Y, Z, N_AXIS, W_AVG, A, B, C, OUT
; this program takes in 4 variables and outputs a matrix
; X, Y, and Z are input arrays
; N_AXIS is the number of axes in the input
; W_AVG is the weight average to be applied to the input arrays
; A, B, and C are intermediate variables used for calculations

; create output matrix and initialize to zero
OUT = FLTARR(3, N_AXIS)

; loop through each axis
FOR I = 0, N_AXIS-1 DO BEGIN
