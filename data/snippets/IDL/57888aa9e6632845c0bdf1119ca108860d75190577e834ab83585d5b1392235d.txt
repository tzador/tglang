;; This is a code snippet in IDL with various functions and variables

;; Define an array variable of size 10
array = fltarr(10)

;; Loop through the array and assign values using a random number generator
for i=0,9 do begin
    random_number = randomn(seed=123)
    array(i) = random_number
endfor

;; Calculate the mean of the array using IDL's built-in function
mean = mean(array)

;; Apply a linear fit to the array
m = linfit(array)

;; Print the results
print, "Mean: ", mean
print, "Linear fit slope: ", m

;; Define a function to calculate the standard deviation of an array
function stddeviation(arr)

;; Calculate the mean of the array
mean = mean(arr)

;; Initialize a variable to store the sum of squared differences
sum_squares = 0.0

;; Loop through the array and calculate the squared difference of each element from the mean
for i=0,n_elements(arr)-1 do begin
    diff = arr(i) - mean
    sum_squares += diff * diff
endfor

;; Calculate the standard deviation using the formula
stddev = sqrt(sum_squares / n_elements(arr))

;; Return the standard deviation
return, stddev
end

;; Call the function and print the result
std = stddeviation(array)
print, "Standard deviation: ", std
