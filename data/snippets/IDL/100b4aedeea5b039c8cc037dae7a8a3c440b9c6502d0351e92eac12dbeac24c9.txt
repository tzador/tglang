function distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)
; Calculates the distance between two given points 
; Arguments:
;   x1 - x-coordinate of first point
;   y1 - y-coordinate of first point
;   x2 - x-coordinate of second point
;   y2 - y-coordinate of second point
; Returns:
;   The distance between the two points as a float
 begin
    ; Calculate the x and y distances between the two points 
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    ; Calculate the squared values of the x and y distances
    dx_sq = dx * dx
    dy_sq = dy * dy
    ; Calculate the sum of the squared values
    d_squared = dx_sq + dy_sq 	
    ; Return the square root of the sum as the distance
    return sqrt(d_squared)
