PRO dedicated_processing, image, marker, threshold
; Declares a procedure named dedicated_processing with inputs of image, marker, 
; and threshold.
;
; Parameters:
;   image - The input image to be processed.
;   marker - The marker image for the processing.
;   threshold - The threshold value for the processing.
;
; Returns:
;   A processed image as an output.

  ; Sets the processing parameters using the input values.
  image_file = FILEPATH(image)
  marker_file = FILEPATH(marker)
  low_thresh = threshold - 50
  high_thresh = threshold + 50

  ; Reads in the image and marker files.
  READ_PNG, image_data, image_file
  READ_PNG, marker_data, marker_file

  ; Applies a median filter to the image.
  image_filtered = MEDIAN(image_data, 3, 3)

  ; Determines the regions of interest using the marker image and threshold values.
  roi = WHERE(marker_data GT low_thresh AND marker_data LT high_thresh, count)

  ; Applies a threshold to the image using the region of interest.
  image_thresh = THRESHOLD(image_filtered, roi)

  ; Performs dilation and erosion on the thresholded image.
  image_final = DILATE(ERODE(image_thresh, 3), 3)

  ; Returns the final processed image.
