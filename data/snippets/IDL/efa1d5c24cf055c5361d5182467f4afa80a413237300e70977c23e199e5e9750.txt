; Define a function that calculates the factorial of a number
FUNCTION factorial, number 

; Set up an integer variable to hold the factorial value
factorial_val = 1 

; Loop through all the numbers from 1 to the given number
FOR i = 1, number DO BEGIN 

; Multiply the current factorial value by the number
factorial_val = factorial_val * i 

; End the loop
ENDFOR 

; Return the calculated factorial value
RETURN, factorial_val 

; Define the main program
PRO main 

; Prompt the user to enter a number
PRINT, "Enter a number: " 

; Get the input from the user and store it in a variable
READ, input_num 

; Calculate the factorial using the previously defined function
result = factorial(input_num) 

; Print the result
PRINT, "Factorial of ", input_num, " is ", result 

; End the main program
