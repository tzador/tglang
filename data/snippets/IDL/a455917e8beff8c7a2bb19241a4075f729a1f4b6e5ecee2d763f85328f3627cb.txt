; This is a code snippet in IDL that creates a simple plot of a function
; First, define the independent variable x as an array from 0 to 10 with 100 data points 
x = FINDGEN(100,10,0)
; Next, define the function y = x^2 + 5x - 10
y = x^2 + 5*x - 10
; Plot the function using basic line settings
PLOT, x, y, LINESTYLE = 1, COLOR = 255, THICK = 2, TITLE = 'Function Plot', XTITLE = 'x', YTITLE = 'y'
; Add grid lines to the plot
AXES, GRID = 1 
; Add a legend with the function equation
LEGEND, ['y = x^2 + 5x - 10']
; Change the font and size of the legend
LEGEND, FONT = 'Arial', FONT_SIZE = 14
; Change the color of the legend
LEGEND, COLOR = 0
; Save the plot as a png file
DEVICE, FILENAME = 'function_plot.png', FORMAT = 'PNG'
; Save the plot as a PostScript file for printing
DEVICE, FILENAME = 'function_plot.ps', FORMAT = 'PS'
; Finally, display the plot
