; Define a variable "N" with value 5
N = 5

; Create an array "data" using the "indgen" function with range of 0 to N-1 
data = indgen(N)

; Print the values in the "data" array
print, data

; Use a for loop to iterate through each element in the "data" array
for i=0, N-1 do begin 

; Create a new index variable "j" and set it equal to the value of "i"
j = i 

; Use a while loop with the condition j is less than or equal to N
while (j <= N) do begin 

; Multiply the element at index "j" by 2 and store it back in the same index
data[j] = data[j]*2 

; Increment variable "j" by 1 
j = j+1 

; Print the updated element at index "j"
print, data[j]
