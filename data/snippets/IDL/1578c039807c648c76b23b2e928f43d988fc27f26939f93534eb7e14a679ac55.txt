pro procedure_name, a, b, c, /keywords, x, y, z
; This is a procedure in IDL that takes four inputs and three keywords.
; The inputs are a, b, c and x, y, z are the outputs.
; This procedure performs a calculation on the inputs based on the user-defined keywords.

; Create an array of random numbers from the inputs
arr = rand(a, b, c)

; Check if 'x' keyword is set
if keyword_set(x) then begin

    ; If x is set, perform a calculation on the array and assign it to x
    x = sin(arr) * cos(arr)
endif

; Check if 'y' keyword is set
if keyword_set(y) then begin

    ; If y is set, multiply the array with 2 and assign it to y
    y = arr * 2
endif

; Check if 'z' keyword is set
if keyword_set(z) then begin

    ; If z is set, divide the array by 5 and assign it to z
    z = arr / 5
endif

; Print the final outputs
print, 'x = ', x
print, 'y = ', y
print, 'z = ', z
