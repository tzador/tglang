PRO LTEngineer, dimensions
  ; This is a procedure definition for a function called LTEngineer that takes in an argument 'dimensions'
  COMPILE_OPT idl2
  ; Sets compiler options to IDL version 2 compatibility
  
  ; Declare variables to be used in the procedure
  DIMENSION throughput[dimensions]
  DIMENSION spectralEfficiency[dimensions]
  DIMENSION latency[dimensions]
  
  ; Print a message to indicate beginning of calculations
  PRINT, 'Starting calculations for LTE engineering...'
  
  ; Loop through dimensions
  FOR i=0L, dimensions-1 DO BEGIN
    ; Calculate the throughput
    throughput[i] = (2*dimensions[i])*3.5
