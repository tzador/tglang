;; This is a program in IDL that calculates the area of a rectangle

;; Declaring the length and width variables
length = 5.6 ;; length of rectangle
width = 2.4 ;; width of rectangle

;; Defining the function to calculate the area
func calc_area, l, w
begin
    return l * w
end

;; Calling the function and storing the result in a variable
area = calc_area(length, width)

;; Printing the result to the terminal
print, 'The area of the rectangle is: ', area, 'square units'
