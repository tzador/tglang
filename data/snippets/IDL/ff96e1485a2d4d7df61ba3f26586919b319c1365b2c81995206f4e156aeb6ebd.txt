;; This is a program that calculates the average velocity of a moving object.
;; The user must provide the distance in meters and the time in seconds.

;; Define variables for distance and time
distance = 0.0
time = 0.0

;; Prompt user for input and convert to float
print, "Enter distance in meters:"
read, distance
distance = float(distance)
print, "Enter time in seconds:"
read, time
time = float(time)

;; Calculate average velocity
velocity = distance / time

;; Print result with units
print, "The average velocity is ", velocity, "m/s."
