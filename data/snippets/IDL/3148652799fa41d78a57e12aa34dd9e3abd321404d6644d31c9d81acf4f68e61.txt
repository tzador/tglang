;; This code snippet creates a function that calculates the Chi-square statistic for a given set of data.
;; Input: data - a 1D array of data points
;;        expected - a 1D array of expected values
;; Output: chisq - the Chi-square statistic
FUNCTION calculate_chisq, data, expected
  ;; Initialize the output variable
  chisq = 0.0

  ;; Calculate the number of data points
  n = N_ELEMENTS(data)

  ;; Loop through each data point
  FOR i = 0, n-1 DO BEGIN
    ;; Calculate the difference between observed and expected values for the data point
    diff = (data[i] - expected[i])^2
    ;; Add the difference to the current value of the Chi-square statistic
    chisq = chisq + diff
  ENDFOR

  ;; Output the final value of the Chi-square statistic
  RETURN, chisq
