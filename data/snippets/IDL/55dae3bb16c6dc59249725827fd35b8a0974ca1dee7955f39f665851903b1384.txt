;; This code snippet calculates the distance between two points in 3D space using the Pythagorean theorem.

;; Define function to calculate distance between points
function calculate_distance, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2

;; Calculate the difference between coordinates
dx = x2 - x1
dy = y2 - y1
dz = z2 - z1

;; Calculate the distance using the Pythagorean theorem
distance = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2)

;; Print the distance
print, 'The distance between point (', x1, y1, z1, ') and point (', x2, y2, z2, ') is: ', distance

;; End function
endfunction

;; Define variables for the coordinates of the two points
x1 = 2.5
y1 = 3.8
z1 = 6.2

x2 = 5.1
y2 = 7.6
z2 = 9.4

;; Call the function to calculate the distance between the two points
distance = calculate_distance(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)
