/* This code snippet creates an array of random numbers and calculates the standard deviation */

PRO test
    n = 10000 ; Number of elements in array
    data = RANDOMU(seed, n) ; Generate random numbers between 0 and 1
    mean = TOTAL(data) / n ; Calculate mean
    sum = 0. ; Sum variable
    ; Loop through array and calculate sum of squared differences from mean
    FOR i = 0, n-1 DO BEGIN
        sum += (data[i] - mean)^2
    ENDFOR
    
    variance = sum / (n-1) ; Calculate variance
    std_dev = SQRT(variance) ; Calculate standard deviation
    
    ; Print results
    PRINT, "Mean: ", mean
    PRINT, "Variance: ", variance
    PRINT, "Standard Deviation: ", std_dev
