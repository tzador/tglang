; This is a program that calculates the average of an array of numbers

; Declare variables
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ; input array of numbers
sum = 0 ; variable to store the sum
n = n_elements(array) ; variable to store the number of elements in the array

; Loop through the array to calculate the sum
for i=0, n-1 do begin
    sum = sum + array[i]
endfor

; Calculate the average
avg = sum / n

; Print the average
print, "The average of the array is: ", avg

; Output:
; `The average of the array is: 3`
