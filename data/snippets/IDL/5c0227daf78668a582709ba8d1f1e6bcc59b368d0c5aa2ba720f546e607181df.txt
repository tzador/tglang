; This is a complex code snippet in IDL
; It generates a 3D array of random numbers, replicates it,
; and then calculates the mean of each 2D array along the third dimension.

; Generate a 3D array of random numbers with dimensions 10 x 8 x 5
array = randomu(seed, 10, 8, 5)

; Replicate the array along the third dimension to create a 3D array with 10 copies
array_replicated = replicate(array, 10, 3)

; Define a function to calculate the mean of a 2D array
function calc_mean_2d, array
  return, total(array) / n_elements(array)

; Initialize an empty array to store the means of each 2D array
means = fltarr(10)

; Loop over each 2D array in the 3D array and calculate the mean
for i=0, 9 do begin
  ; Extract the i-th 2D array from the 3D array
  temp = array_replicated[*, *, i]
  ; Calculate the mean of the 2D array and store it in the means array
  means[i] = calc_mean_2d(temp)
endfor

; Print out the means array
print, means
