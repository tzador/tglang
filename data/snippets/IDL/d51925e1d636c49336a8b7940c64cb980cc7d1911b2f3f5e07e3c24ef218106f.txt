; Declare variables for X and Y coordinates
x = 2.5
y = 6.8

; Define a function to calculate the distance between two points
function distance, point1, point2
  ; Calculate the difference between X and Y coordinates
  dx = point2[0] - point1[0]
  dy = point2[1] - point1[1]

  ; Calculate the squared distance
  dist2 = dx^2 + dy^2

  ; Take the square root to get the actual distance
  dist = sqrt(dist2)

  ; Return the distance
  return, dist
end

; Call the function with our two points
distance = distance([0,0], [x,y])

; Print the result to the screen
print, "The distance between (0,0) and ("+strtrim(x,2)+","+strtrim(y,2)+") is "+strtrim(distance,2)
