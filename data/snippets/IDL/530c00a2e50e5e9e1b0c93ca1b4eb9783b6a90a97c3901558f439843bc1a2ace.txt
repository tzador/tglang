PRO FIBONACCI, N
; This procedure calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
; Input: N, the position of the desired number in the sequence
; Output: F(N), the value at position N in the sequence
;
; Initialize variables
A = 0L              ; Holds first number in sequence
B = 1L              ; Holds second number in sequence
F = A + B           ; Holds value at current position
; Check for valid input
IF N LE 0 THEN BEGIN    ; If N is less than or equal to 0
    PRINT, 'Invalid input. N must be a positive integer.' ; Print error message
    RETURN          ; Exit procedure
ENDIF
; Calculate sequence up to desired position
FOR I = 3L, N DO BEGIN       ; Start at 3rd position, end at Nth position
    A = B                   ; Previous number in sequence becomes first
    B = F                   ; Current value becomes second
    F = A + B               ; Calculate new value
ENDFOR
; Return desired value
RETURN, F
