;Calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
;
;Inputs:
;   n - The integer specifying which number in the sequence to calculate
;
;Outputs:
;   The nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
;
;Example:
;print, fibonacci(5) ;outputs 8

;Initialize variables and arrays
x = 0 ;previous number in sequence
y = 1 ;current number in sequence
fibo = [x, y] ;array to store sequence

;Loop through sequence until nth number is reached
for i = 2, n do begin
    z = x + y ;calculate next number in sequence
    fibo = [fibo, z] ;add number to sequence array
    x = y ;shift variables for next iteration
    y = z
endfor

;Print nth number in sequence
return, fibo[n-1]
