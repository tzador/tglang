; This program displays the Fibonacci series
; up to a user-defined number

; Define a function to calculate the nth
; element of the Fibonacci series
function fib_series, max

; Create an array to store the series
series = fltarr(max)

; Assign the first two elements of the
; series with the values 0 and 1
series[0] = 0
series[1] = 1

; Loop through the remaining elements
; and calculate the values using the
; previous two elements in the series
for i = 2, max-1 do begin
    series[i] = series[i-1] + series[i-2]
endfor

; Print out the series
print, "The Fibonacci series up to " + strtrim(max) + " is:"
print, series

; End the function and return the series
return, series
end

; Prompt the user to enter a number
print, "Please enter the maximum value to display:"
read, max

; Call the function and store the returned
; series in a variable
series = fib_series(max)

; Display the series
print, ""
print, "The Fibonacci series up to " + strtrim(max) + " is:"
