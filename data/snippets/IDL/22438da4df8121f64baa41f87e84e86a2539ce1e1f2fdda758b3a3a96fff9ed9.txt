IDL> a = FINDGEN(100) %*% TRANSPOSE(FINDGEN(10))
; this code creates a 100x10 array of numbers and multiplies it by its transpose
; note: %*% is the symbol for matrix multiplication in IDL

IDL> b = a[*, 0:4]
; this code creates a sub-array of 'a' containing the first 5 columns

IDL> c = TOTAL(b, DIM=1)
; this code calculates the sum of each column in 'b'

IDL> d = INDGEN(100)
; this code creates an array of numbers counting from 0 to 99

IDL> plot, d, c, /xstyle=4, /ystyle=2
; this code plots 'c' on the y-axis and 'd' on the x-axis
; note: /xstyle=4 and /ystyle=2 are optional arguments that change the plotting style
