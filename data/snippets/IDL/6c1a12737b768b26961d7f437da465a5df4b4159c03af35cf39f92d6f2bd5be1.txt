; This code snippet uses IDL which stands for Interactive Data Language. 
; It is a programming language commonly used for data analysis and visualization.

PRO calc_wave_properties, wave_data, wave_properties
; This is a procedure that calculates properties of a given wave using data points.

   ; Define variables for storing output results
   n = N_ELEMENTS(wave_data) ; Get number of data points
   mean = 0.0 ; Initialize mean value
   std_dev = 0.0 ; Initialize standard deviation value

   ; Calculate mean of the wave data
   FOR i = 0, n-1 DO BEGIN
      mean = mean + wave_data[i] ; Accumulate data values
   ENDFOR
   mean = mean / n ; Divide by total number of points

   ; Calculate standard deviation of the wave data
   FOR i = 0, n-1 DO BEGIN
      std_dev = std_dev + (wave_data[i] - mean)^2 ; Calculate squared differences from mean
   ENDFOR
   std_dev = SQRT(std_dev / (n-1)) ; Divide by (N-1) for unbiased estimate

   ; Calculate maximum and minimum values
   max_val = MAX(wave_data) ; Get maximum value
   min_val = MIN(wave_data) ; Get minimum value

   ; Output results using structure
   wave_properties.mean = mean
   wave_properties.std_dev = std_dev
   wave_properties.max_val = max_val
   wave_properties.min_val = min_val
   RETURN, wave_properties ; Return structure with calculated properties
