;; Declares an integer variable
 **;; This is a comment in IDL syntax**
 integer a 
;; Annotated variables can have a type, a name, and an optional optional value

;; Assigns a value to the variable a
a = 5

;; Declares a string variable
string name

;; Assigns a value to the variable name
name = "John Doe"

;; Declares an array of floating-point numbers
;; This can also be written as float a[10], but this is for demonstration purposes
