;; This code snippet is an example of a complex function in IDL
;; It takes in two arrays and calculates the correlation coefficient between them

FUNCTION CORRELATE, x, y
  ;; Input:
  ;; x: first array of values (must be same length as y)
  ;; y: second array of values (must be same length as x)

  ;; Output:
  ;; corr: correlation coefficient between x and y

  ;; First, we check if arrays are of equal length
  IF (N_ELEMENTS(x) NE N_ELEMENTS(y)) THEN BEGIN
    PRINT, "Arrays must be of equal length."
    RETURN, -1
  ENDIF

  ;; Finding the mean of x and y
  mean_x = TOTAL(x) / N_ELEMENTS(x)
  mean_y = TOTAL(y) / N_ELEMENTS(y)

  ;; Calculating the sum of squares
  sx = TOTAL((x - mean_x)^2)
  sy = TOTAL((y - mean_y)^2)

  ;; Calculating the sum of products
  sxy = TOTAL((x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y))

  ;; Calculating the correlation coefficient
  corr = sxy/SQRT(sx * sy)

  RETURN, corr
