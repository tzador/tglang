;; Example of a complex IDL code snippet

;; Define a function to calculate the factorial
PRO calculate_factorial, n
  ;; Initialize the result to 1
  result = 1
  ;; Loop through numbers from n down to 1
  FOR i = n, 1, -1 DO BEGIN
    ;; Multiply result by current number
    result = result * i
  ENDFOR
  ;; Return the factorial
  RETURN, result
END

;; Define a keyword structure for a person
STRUCTURE Person, $
  Name: "", $
  Age: 0, $
  Occupation: "", $
  Address: "", $
  Phone_number: ""

;; Create a new instance of a person
person = {Name: "John Doe", Age: 35, Occupation: "Engineer", Address: "123 Main Street", Phone_number: "555-555-5555"}

;; Create a list of favorite fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango", "pineapple"]

;; Print the person's name and occupation
PRINT, "Name:", person.Name, "Occupation:", person.Occupation

;; Print the factorial of 5
PRINT, "Factorial of 5:", calculate_factorial(5)

;; Loop through the list of fruits and print each one
FOR i = 0, 4 DO BEGIN
  PRINT, fruits[i]
ENDFOR

;; Plot a sin wave with 100 points
PLOT, FINDGEN(100), SIN(2*!PI*FINDGEN(100)), $
