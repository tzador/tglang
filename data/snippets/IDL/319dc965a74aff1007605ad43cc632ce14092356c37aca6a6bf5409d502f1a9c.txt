; This program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in n-dimensional space.

; Define function to calculate Euclidean distance
function euclidean_distance, x1, x2, n

; Initialize variables
total = 0.0

; Loop through all dimensions
for i=0, n-1 do begin
    ; Calculate difference between coordinates in dimension i
    delta = x2[i] - x1[i]

    ; Square the difference and add to total
    total = total + delta^2
endfor

; Take square root of total to get final distance
distance = sqrt(total)

; Return distance
return, distance

; Define two points with n coordinates
point1 = [5, 3, 2]
point2 = [1, 7, 4]

; Calculate distance between the two points
result = euclidean_distance(point1, point2, 3)

; Print the result
print, "The Euclidean distance between", point1, "and", point2, "is", result
