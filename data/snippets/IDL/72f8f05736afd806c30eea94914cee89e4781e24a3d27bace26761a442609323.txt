pro fibonacci, n, results
; Computes the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence and stores them in an array
; INPUT: n - number of terms to generate, results - empty array to hold the results
; OUTPUT: updated results array with first n terms of Fibonacci sequence

results = fltarr(n) ; initialize results array
results[0] = 0 ; first element of sequence is 0
results[1] = 1 ; second element of sequence is 1
for i=2, n-1 do begin ; loop from third element to n-1 (since first two are already computed)
   results[i] = results[i-1] + results[i-2] ; compute each term using previous two terms
endfor
