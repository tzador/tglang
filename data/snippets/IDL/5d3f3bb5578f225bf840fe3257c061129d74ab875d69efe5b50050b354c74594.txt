;This is a code snippet in IDL (Interactive Data Language)
;It creates a structure with nested tags and prints the values stored in it
;The structure contains information about a particular student

student = { ;create a structure
name: "John Smith" ;string tag
age: 18 ;integer tag
major: "Computer Science" ;string tag
classes: { ;create a nested structure for classes
"Introduction to Programming": {grade: 95} ;create a nested structure for a specific class
"Calculus": {grade: 85}
"English Composition": {grade: 90}
}
}

;print the values stored in the student structure
print, "Name: ", student.name ;output: Name: John Smith
print, "Age: ", student.age ;output: Age: 18
print, "Major: ", student.major ;output: Major: Computer Science
;loop through the classes structure and print the grades for each class
for key, value in student.classes do begin
    print, key, " Grade: ", value.grade ;output: Introduction to Programming Grade: 95
                                        ;Calculus Grade: 85
                                        ;English Composition Grade: 90
