FUNCTION DISTANCE, x1, y1, x2, y2
  ; Calculates the distance between two points given their coordinates
  ; Inputs:
  ;   x1 - x coordinate of first point
  ;   y1 - y coordinate of first point
  ;   x2 - x coordinate of second point
  ;   y2 - y coordinate of second point
  ; Outputs:
  ;   d - calculated distance between the two points
  
  ; Calculate distance using Pythagorean theorem
  d = SQRT((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)
  
  ; Return calculated distance
  RETURN, d
