; This code snippet calculates the sum of squares using a do loop in IDL

pro sum_of_squares, n

; This is a procedure that takes in a single argument n and calculates
; the sum of the squares from 1 to n.

  a = 0 ; initialize the accumulator variable

; Start of do loop

  FOR i=1, n DO $

; The FOR loop iterates from 1 to n and performs the following operations on each iteration:

    a = a + (i * i) ; calculate sum of squares up to current iteration number
    
; End of do loop

  print, "The sum of squares from 1 to " + string(n) + " is: " + string(a)

end ; ends the procedure

; Call the procedure with an input value of 10
sum_of_squares, 10

; Output:
;
; The sum of squares from 1 to 10 is: 385
