; This code snippet calculates the cross correlation function between two arrays

; Define arrays
x = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
y = [4, 5, 4, 2, 1]

; Calculate mean of x and y
mean_x = mean(x)
mean_y = mean(y)

; Subtract the mean from each array
mean_sub_x = x - mean_x
mean_sub_y = y - mean_y

; Calculate the sums of squares of the mean-subtracted arrays
sum_x = total(mean_sub_x^2)
sum_y = total(mean_sub_y^2)

; Calculate the cross correlation function
corr_func = convol(mean_sub_x, mean_sub_y) / sqrt((sum_x * sum_y))

; Print the result
print, corr_func
