pro fibonacci, n, x

; Procedure to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term
; Input:
;   n (int): The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to be calculated
;   x (fltarr): An undefined array to store the sequence
; Output:
;   x (fltarr): The Fibonacci sequence stored in an array

compile_opt strictarr, hidden

; Initialization
x = fltarr(n)

; Calculate the first two terms
x[0] = 0
x[1] = 1

; Loop through the remaining terms
for i=2,n-1 do begin
    ; Use recursion formula to calculate next term
    x[i] = x[i-1] + x[i-2]
endfor

; Return the sequence
return, x
