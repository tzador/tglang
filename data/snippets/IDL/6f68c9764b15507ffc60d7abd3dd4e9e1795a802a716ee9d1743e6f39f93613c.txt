; This program calculates the distance and velocity of a moving object
; based on the initial position and time

pro distvel, pos, time

; pos and time are arrays containing the initial position and time for each object

  for i=0, n_elements(pos)-1 do begin

; Loop through each object

    distance = pos[i] + (0.5 * 9.8 * time[i]^2)

; Calculate the distance using formula: distance = initial position + (0.5 * acceleration * time^2)

    velocity = 9.8 * time[i]

; Calculate the velocity using formula: velocity = acceleration * time

    print, "Object", i+1, "Distance:", distance, "Velocity:", velocity

; Print the object number, distance, and velocity for each object
