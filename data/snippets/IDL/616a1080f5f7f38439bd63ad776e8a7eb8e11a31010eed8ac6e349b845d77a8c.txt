;; This is a procedure that takes in an array of numbers, an integer, and a string as parameters

compiled = INTVAR ;set the compiled variable to be equal to the integer given
index = compiled + 1 ;set the initial index value to be one more than the integer given

;; This is a for loop that iterates through the array of numbers
for j = 0, compiled do begin 
	;; Converts each number in the array to a string and adds it to the STRVAR variable
	STRVAR += string(arrnums[j]) 
	STRVAR += " " ;adds a space in between each number
endfor

;; Prints out the final string variable with a newline character at the end
print, STRVAR + " \n"
