;This code snippet creates a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence for a given input number

FUNCTION fibonacci, n

;Create variables for storing calculated values
LONG first, second, third, i

;Set initial values
first = 0L
second = 1L
third = 0L

;Loop through n number of times
FOR i=0L,n-1 DO BEGIN

    ;Calculate new value using previous two values
    third = first + second

    ;Update previous values
    first = second
    second = third
ENDFOR

;Print the result
PRINT, third

;Return the value for use outside of the function
RETURN, third

END
