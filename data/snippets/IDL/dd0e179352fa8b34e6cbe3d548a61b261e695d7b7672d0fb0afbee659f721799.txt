  ; This procedure solves a quadratic equation
  ; with real coefficients using the quadratic formula
  ; and prints the roots to the screen

  ; Define the quadratic equation coefficients
  a = 2.0
  b = 5.0
  c = 3.0

  ; Calculate the discriminant
  d = b^2 - 4 * a * c

  ; Check for complex roots
  if d lt 0 then begin
    print, "The roots are complex numbers."
  endif

  ; Calculate the real roots
  r1 = (-b + sqrt(d)) / (2 * a)
  r2 = (-b - sqrt(d)) / (2 * a)

  ; Print the roots to the screen
  print, "The roots are: ", r1, " and ", r2

  ; End of procedure
