; This is a sample IDL program
; It will perform data analysis on a set of numbers
; First we will define the data
data = [1, 5, 8, 3, 9, 2, 11]

; Next we will calculate the mean of the data
mean = mean(data)

; Now we will calculate the standard deviation
stdev = stddev(data)

; Print out the results 
print, "The mean of the data is: ", mean 
print, "The standard deviation of the data is: ", stdev

; We will also calculate the median of the data
median = median(data)

; Check if the median value is even or odd
is_even = (N_elements(data) mod 2) == 0

; If it is even, we will need to take the average of the two middle values
if is_even then begin
    middle_elements = data[(N_elements(data)/2):((N_elements(data)/2)+1)]
    median = mean(middle_elements)
endif

; Output the median value
print, "The median of the data is: ", median

; Next we will find the maximum and minimum values in the data
max = max(data)
min = min(data)

; Output the maximum and minimum values
print, "The maximum value in the data is: ", max
print, "The minimum value in the data is: ", min
