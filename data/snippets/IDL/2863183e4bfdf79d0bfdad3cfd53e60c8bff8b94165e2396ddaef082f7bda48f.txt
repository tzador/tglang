; This code snippet shows how to calculate the average of an array of numbers
; and store it in a variable

; Define an array of 10 numbers
arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

; Calculate the sum of the numbers using the 'total' function
; This function takes in an array as input and returns the sum of all its elements
sum = total(arr)

; Calculate the length of the array using the 'n_elements' function
; This function takes in an array as input and returns the number of elements in the array
len = n_elements(arr)

; Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length
avg = sum / len

; Print the average value
print, 'The average of the array is: ', avg
