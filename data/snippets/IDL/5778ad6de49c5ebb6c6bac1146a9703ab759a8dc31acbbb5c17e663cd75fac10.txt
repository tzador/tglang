; This is a sample program in IDL

; Define an integer variable
intVar = 5

;print integer variable
print, "Integer variable:", intVar

; Initialize an array
intArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

; Loop through the array and print each element
for i = 0, 4 do begin
    print, "Array element at index", i, ":", intArr[i]
endfor

; Create a structure
struct = {name: "John", age: 25, city: "New York"}

; Print the structure
print, "Name:", struct.name
print, "Age:", struct.age
print, "City:", struct.city

; Define a function to calculate the sum of two numbers
function sum(x, y)
return, x + y

; Call the function and print the result
print, "Sum of 3 and 6:", sum(3, 6)

; Open a file
openFile = open("data.txt", /read)

; Read the contents of the file and print them
while not eof(openFile) do begin
    line = readf(openFile)
    print, "Line from file:", line
endwhile

; Close the file
closeFile = close(openFile)
