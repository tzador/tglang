DEFINE VARIABLE i AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.
DEFINE VARIABLE j AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.
DEFINE VARIABLE k AS INTEGER NO-UNDO INIT 10.

DO i = 1 TO 5: /* Start of outer loop */
    DO j = 1 TO i - 1: /* Start of inner loop */
        k = k - 2 + i * j. /* Calculate k */
        IF k > 20 THEN /* Condition check */

/* Output:
Output would vary depending on the values of i and j, but it would look similar to this:

k is greater than 20.
k is less than or equal to 20.
k is greater than 20.
k is greater than 20.
k is greater than 20. */
