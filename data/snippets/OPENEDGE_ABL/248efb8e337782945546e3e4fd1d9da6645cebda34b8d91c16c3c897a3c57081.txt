/* This code snippet is an example of a nested FOR loop in OpenEdge ABL */

DEFINE VARIABLE i AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.
DEFINE VARIABLE j AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.

/* Outer FOR loop to iterate through the first 10 numbers */
DO i = 1 TO 10:

/* Inner FOR loop to iterate through the first 5 numbers */
DO j = 1 TO 5:

/* Output the product of i and j */
MESSAGE "Product of" i "and" j "is" (i * j).

END. /* End of inner FOR loop */
END. /* End of outer FOR loop */

/* Output:
Product of 1 and 1 is 1
Product of 1 and 2 is 2
Product of 1 and 3 is 3
Product of 1 and 4 is 4
Product of 1 and 5 is 5
Product of 2 and 1 is 2
Product of 2 and 2 is 4
Product of 2 and 3 is 6
