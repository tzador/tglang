/*This program is used to calculate the area of a circle*/
/*First, we declare variables for radius, pi, and area*/
DEFINE VARIABLE radius AS DECIMAL.
DEFINE VARIABLE pi AS DECIMAL INITIAL "3.14".
DEFINE VARIABLE area AS DECIMAL NO-UNDO.

/*Next, we ask the user to input the radius of the circle*/
PROMPT-FOR radius WITH FRAME title "Enter Radius of Circle".

/*Then, we calculate the area using the formula pi * r^2 and store it in the area variable*/
area = pi * radius * radius.

/*We can then display the result to the user*/
DISPLAY "The area of the circle with radius " radius " is: " area.

/*Lastly, we check if the area is greater than 100*/
/*If it is, we print a message saying it is a large circle*/
IF area > 100 THEN DO:
    DISPLAY "This is a large circle!".
END.
/*If it is not, we print a message saying it is a small circle*/
ELSE DO:
    DISPLAY "This is a small circle!".
END.
