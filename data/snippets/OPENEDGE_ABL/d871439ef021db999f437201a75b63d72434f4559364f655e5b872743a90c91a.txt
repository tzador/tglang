/* This program takes in user input and converts it to uppercase */

DEFINE VARIABLE userInput AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO.
DEFINE VARIABLE upperInput AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO.

INPUT FROM CONSOLE.
REPEAT:
  IMPORT userInput.
  upperInput = STRING(TOUPPER(userInput)).
  MESSAGE("Your input in uppercase is:" + upperInput).
END.

/* Explanation:
The program first declares two variables, userInput and upperInput, both of which are of type CHARACTER and marked as NO-UNDO, meaning their values cannot be changed.

Next, it prompts the user for input from the console using the INPUT statement.

Then, it enters a REPEAT loop that will continue to run until user input is complete.

Within the loop, the user input is imported using the IMPORT statement and stored in the userInput variable.

The TOUPPER function is used to convert the userInput to uppercase, and the STRING function converts the result to a string value, which is then stored in the upperInput variable.

Finally, the MESSAGE statement outputs the converted input to the console, along with a message prompt.*/
