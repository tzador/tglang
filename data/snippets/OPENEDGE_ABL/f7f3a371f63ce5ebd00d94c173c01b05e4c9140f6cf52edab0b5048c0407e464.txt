DEFINE VARIABLE cName AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO FORMAT "X(25)" ANNOTATE "This variable stores a string value of maximum 25 characters.".
FOR EACH Customer NO-LOCK WHERE Customer.Country = "USA" BY Customer.LastName ASC:

    ON ERROR UNDO, THROW.
END.
/* This code snippet uses the DEFINE VARIABLE statement to declare a character variable named cName with a format of X(25) and an annotation of maximum 25 characters.
Next, a FOR EACH loop is used to iterate through the Customer table with a condition to only select customers from the USA, and sorts them in ascending order by last name.
Within the loop, the DISPLAY statement is used to output the customer's ID, first name, and last name, with a format of 99 and a line break after each record.
An ON ERROR block is included to handle any errors and will undo any changes and throw an error message.
The loop ends with an END statement.
