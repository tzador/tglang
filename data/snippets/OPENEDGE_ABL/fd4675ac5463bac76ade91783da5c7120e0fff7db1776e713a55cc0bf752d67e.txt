DEFINE VARIABLE i AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Declaring a variable i of type integer */

DO i = 1 TO 10: /* Start of DO loop with variable i ranging from 1 to 10 */

IF i MOD 2 = 0 THEN DO: /* Checking if i is even */
   DISPLAY "Value of i is even". /* Displaying a message to the user */

END. /* End of DO loop */

/* Output: 
Value of i is odd 
Value of i is even */
