DEFINE VARIABLE pi AS DECIMAL NO-UNDO INIT 3.1415927. /* Define a constant for pi */
DEFINE VARIABLE radius AS DECIMAL NO-UNDO. /* Define a variable for radius */
DEFINE VARIABLE area AS DECIMAL NO-UNDO. /* Define a variable for area */


/* Prompt the user for the radius of the circle and store it in the radius variable */

PROMPT-FOR radius WITH TITLE "Enter radius of the circle".


/* Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: area = pi * radius^2 */

area = pi * radius ** 2. /* The ** operator is used for exponentiation */


/* Display the result to the user */

DISPLAY "The area of the circle with a radius of " + STRING(radius) +
" is " + STRING(area) + " square units." WITH CENTERED TITLE "Result".


/* Comment to explain the output to the user */
/* The area is measured in square units because the radius is in the same unit as the area. */
