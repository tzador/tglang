    FIELD customer-num AS INTEGER FORMAT ">>>,>>>,>>>,>>9"
    FIELD cust-name AS CHARACTER FORMAT "x(30)"

/* The above code snippet defines a temp-table named tt-customer with three fields: 
customer-num, cust-name, and cust-city. 
The customer-num field is an integer and is formatted to display commas and a space between every 3 digits, 
with a total of 9 digits. 
The cust-name and cust-city fields are both characters with a maximum length of 30 and 20, respectively. 
The NO-UNDO option ensures that the changes made to this temp-table are not undone in a transaction. */
