/* This code snippet shows a complex logic for calculating the average of a list of numbers in OPENEDGE_ABL language */

/* Define a variable to hold the sum of the numbers */
DEFINE VARIABLE sum AS DECIMAL NO-UNDO.

/* Define a variable to hold the count of numbers */
DEFINE VARIABLE count AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.

/* Initialize the variables to 0 */
LET sum = 0.
LET count = 0.

/* Loop through the list of numbers */
FOR EACH num IN numbers:

    /* Check if the current number is greater than 0 */
    IF num > 0 THEN DO:

        /* Add the current number to the sum */
        LET sum = sum + num.

        /* Increment the count */
        LET count = count + 1.

    END.

/* Calculate the average */
LET average = sum / count.

/* Print the result */
MESSAGE "The average of the numbers is:" average.
