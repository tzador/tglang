/* This code snippet is a simple program that calculates the sum of the first 10 positive integers */ 

DEFINE VARIABLE i AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Declares a variable 'i' of type INTEGER and does not allow it to be undone */
DEFINE VARIABLE sum AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Declares a variable 'sum' of type INTEGER and does not allow it to be undone */

DO i = 1 TO 10: /* Starts a DO loop that will iterate from 1 to 10 */
    sum = sum + i. /* Adds current value of 'i' to the current value of 'sum' and stores it back in 'sum' variable */
END.

MESSAGE "The sum of the first 10 positive integers is:" sum. /* Displays a message with the value of the 'sum' variable */

/* Output:
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is: 55
