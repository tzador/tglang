DEFINE VARIABLE i AS INTEGER INITIAL 0 NO-UNDO.
FOR EACH customer NO-LOCK:
    IF customer.country = "USA" THEN DO:
        ASSIGN i = i + 1.
        DISPLAY "Customer "  customer.name " is from the USA".
    END.
END.

/* In this code snippet, we first define a variable ‘i’ as an integer with an initial value of 0 and marking it as NO-UNDO, meaning it cannot be rolled back.
Next, we use a FOR EACH loop to iterate through each record in the ‘customer’ table without locking it, meaning other processes can still access the records while this loop is running.
Within the loop, we check if the ‘country’ field of the current record is equal to “USA”. If it is, we then increment the ‘i’ variable by 1 and display a message stating the customer’s name and their country.
After the loop has iterated through all the records, the value of ‘i’ will represent the total number of customers from the USA.
The output will be:
Customer John Smith is from the USA
Customer Jane Green is from the USA
... (and so on for each USA customer)
The value of ‘i’ will depend on the number of customers from the USA in the database.*/
