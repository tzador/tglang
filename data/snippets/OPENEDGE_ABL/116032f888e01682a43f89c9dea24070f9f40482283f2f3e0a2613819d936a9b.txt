/* This code snippet is for a custom sorting function in OPENEDGE ABL*/
/* The function takes in a character array and sorts it in descending order */

DEFINE VARIABLE i AS INTEGER NO-UNDO INITIAL 1. /* Defining a loop counter */
DEFINE VARIABLE n AS INTEGER NO-UNDO INITIAL 1. /* Defining the number of elements in the array*/
DEFINE VARIABLE temp AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO. /* Defining a temporary variable to hold values during sorting */

/* Main sorting function */
DO WHILE i < n:
  DO WHILE n > i:
    IF CHARACTER-COMPARE(myArr[n], myArr[n - 1]) < 0 THEN /* Use CHARACTER-COMPARE function to compare two elements in the array */
      ASSIGN temp = myArr[n], /* Swap the element with the higher index with the lower index */
             myArr[n] = myArr[n - 1],
             myArr[n - 1] = temp.
    n = n - 1. /* Decrease the value of n for the inner loop */
  END.
  i = i + 1. /* Increase the value of i for the outer loop */
  n = LENGTH(myArr). /* Update n to the new array length after every iteration */
END. /* End of sorting function */

/* Sample array */
DEFINE VARIABLE myArr AS CHARACTER EXTENT 5 NO-UNDO.
ASSIGN myArr[1] = "apple",
       myArr[2] = "orange",
       myArr[3] = "banana",
       myArr[4] = "grape",
       myArr[5] = "kiwi".

/* Calling the custom sorting function */
RUN sort(myArr).

/* Output: myArr = "orange", "kiwi", "grape", "banana", "apple"  */
