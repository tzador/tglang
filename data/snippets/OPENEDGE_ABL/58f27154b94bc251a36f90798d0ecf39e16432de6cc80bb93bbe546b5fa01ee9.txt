/* This code snippet is a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion */

/* Define a function named factorial that takes in one parameter n */
FUNCTION factorial INPUT n AS INTEGER:

    /* Declare a variable named result to store the factorial result */
    DEFINE VARIABLE result AS INTEGER.

    /* Base case: if n is equal to 0, return result as 1 */
    IF n = 0 THEN RETURN 1.

    /* Recursive case: call the factorial function with n-1 as the parameter,
    multiply it with n and assign the result to the 'result' variable */
    result = factorial(n-1) * n.

    /* Return the final result */
    RETURN result.

END FUNCTION.
