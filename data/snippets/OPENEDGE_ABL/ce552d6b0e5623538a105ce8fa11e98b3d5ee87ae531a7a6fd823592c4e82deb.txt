/* This is a code snippet in OPENEDGE_ABL */

/* Declare a variable of type INTEGER */
DEFINE VARIABLE num AS INTEGER.

/* Assign a value to the variable */
LET num = 5.

/* Loop through a set of numbers */
DO u = 1 TO 10:

    /* Check if the number is even */
    IF MOD(u, 2) = 0 THEN DO:
        /* Multiply the number with 3 and add it to the variable */
        LET num = num + (u * 3).
    END.

/* Print the final result */
DISPLAY "The final result is " + STRING(num).

END.

/* Output: The final result is 180 */
