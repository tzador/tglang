/* This is a sample code snippet in OPENEDGE_ABL */

/* Declare variables */
DEFINE VARIABLE i AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.
DEFINE VARIABLE j AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.

/* Initialize variables */
i = 1.
j = 5.

/* Create a DO loop to iterate through a section of code */
DO WHILE i <= 5:

   /* Display a message with the current value of i */
   MESSAGE "Current value of i is: " i.
   
   /* Use IF statement to check if j is odd or even */
   IF MOD(j, 2) = 0 THEN DO:
      /* Display message if j is even */
      MESSAGE "j is an even number".
   END.
   ELSE DO:
      /* Display message if j is odd */

   /* Increment i to move to the next iteration */
   i = i + 1.
   
   /* Decrement j to change its value for the next iteration */
   j = j - 1.
   
END.

/* Output:
Current value of i is: 1
j is an odd number
Current value of i is: 2
j is an even number
Current value of i is: 3
