/* Basic program to calculate factorial of a number */

DEFINE VARIABLE num AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Define a variable to store input number */

DEFINE VARIABLE fact AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Define a variable to store factorial result */

DEFINE VARIABLE i AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Define a loop counter */

DISPLAY "Enter a number to calculate its factorial:" WITH FRAME f1. /* Prompt user to input a number */

UPDATE num WITH FRAME f1. /* Update the value of num with user input */

fact = 1. /* Initialize factorial result to 1 */

DO i = 1 TO num BY 1: /* Loop from 1 to the input number */

    fact = fact * i. /* Multiply the current factorial result by the loop counter */

END.

DISPLAY "The factorial of " + STRING(num) + " is " + STRING(fact). /* Display the factorial result */

/* Output: The factorial of 5 is 120 */
