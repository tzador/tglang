// This code snippet is an example of a nested loop in OPENEDGE_ABL

DEFINE VARIABLE i AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.
FOR i = 1 TO 5:
    DISPLAY "Outer loop iteration " i.
    FOR j = 1 TO 3:
        DISPLAY "Inner loop iteration " j.
        IF i = 3 THEN DO:
            DISPLAY "i is equal to 3, breaking out of inner loop".
            LEAVE. // Break out of inner loop
        END.
    END.
    
    IF i = 4 THEN DO:
        DISPLAY "i is equal to 4, skipping to next iteration".
        NEXT. // Skip to next iteration of outer loop
    END.
END.
