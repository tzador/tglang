/* This code snippet demonstrates how to create a class and define methods and properties in OPENEDGE ABL */

 /* Define a class called "Person" */
CLASS Person:

/* Define a private property called "id" */
PRIVATE PROPERTY id AS INT NO-UNDO.

/* Define a public property called "name" */
PUBLIC PROPERTY name AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO.

/* Define a constructor method with two parameters to set the person's id and name */
CONSTRUCTOR PUBLIC Person (i_id AS INT, c_name AS CHARACTER):
    THIS-OBJECT:id = i_id.
    THIS-OBJECT:name = c_name.
END CONSTRUCTOR.

/* Define a method to print the person's id */
METHOD PUBLIC VOID PrintId ():
    MESSAGE "Person's ID: " + STRING(THIS-OBJECT:id).
END METHOD.

/* Define a method to print the person's name */
METHOD PUBLIC VOID PrintName ():
    MESSAGE "Person's Name: " + THIS-OBJECT:name.
END METHOD.

/* Define a method to change the person's name and return the updated name */
METHOD PUBLIC CHARACTER ChangeName (c_newName AS CHARACTER):
    THIS-OBJECT:name = c_newName.
    RETURN THIS-OBJECT:name.
END METHOD.

END CLASS.
