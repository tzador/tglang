DEFINE VARIABLE length AS DECIMAL NO-UNDO INITIAL 10. /* Declares a variable named length of type decimal and sets its initial value to 10. */
DEFINE VARIABLE width AS DECIMAL NO-UNDO INITIAL 5. /* Declares a variable named width of type decimal and sets its initial value to 5. */
DEFINE VARIABLE area AS DECIMAL NO-UNDO INITIAL 0. /* Declares a variable named area of type decimal and sets its initial value to 0. */
DEFINE VARIABLE perimeter AS DECIMAL NO-UNDO INITIAL 0. /* Declares a variable named perimeter of type decimal and sets its initial value to 0. */

/* Calculates the area by multiplying the length and width. */
ASSIGN area = length * width.
