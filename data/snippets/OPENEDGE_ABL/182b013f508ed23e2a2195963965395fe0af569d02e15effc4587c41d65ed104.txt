/* This is a complex code snippet in OPENEDGE_ABL */
DEFINE VARIABLE cString AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO FORMAT "x(20) EXTENT 3". /* Define a character variable with length of 20 and an extent of 3 */
DEFINE VARIABLE i AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Define an integer variable */

cString[1] = "Hello". /* Assign value "Hello" to the first extent of the character variable */
cString[2] = "World". /* Assign value "World" to the second extent of the character variable */
cString[3] = "!". /* Assign value "!" to the third extent of the character variable */

DO i = 1 TO 3: /* Use a DO loop to iterate through the extents of the character variable */
    DISPLAY cString[i] SKIP(1). /* Display the value of the current extent and skip to the next line */
END.

OUTPUT:
