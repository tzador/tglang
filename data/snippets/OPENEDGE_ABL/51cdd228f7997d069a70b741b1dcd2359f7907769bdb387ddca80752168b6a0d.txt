/* Output:
 * The code snippet above prompts the user for a desired length and then generates a random string of that length using the letters of the alphabet (A-Z). It utilizes a DO loop to generate each character, and the RAND and CHR functions to randomly select and convert the characters. The final string is then printed to the user as an alert box.
