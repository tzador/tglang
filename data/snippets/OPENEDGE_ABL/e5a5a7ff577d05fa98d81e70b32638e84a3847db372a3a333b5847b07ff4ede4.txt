/* The code above generates two random numbers between 0 and 1000, 
ensures that neither is 0, performs a modulo operation, 
displays the result, multiples the numbers by 2 if less than 500, 
and then subtracts numbers from the bigger one in a loop. 
It repeats this process indefinitely until the program is terminated. */
