{&OPENQUERY(ORDERS, "SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate = 2021-08-27");}

In this code snippet, we are using the OPENQUERY function in OPENEDGE_ABL to query the ORDERS table for all orders placed on August 27, 2021. The result is returned as a cursor, which can be used to retrieve the data from the database.

The syntax for this function is as follows:

{&OPENQUERY ( tablename, "query")}

Where 'tablename' is the name of the table being queried and "query" is a string containing the SQL statement to be executed.

In this example, we are using the SELECT statement to retrieve all columns from the ORDERS table, where the order date is equal to August 27, 2021.

Note that the date is specified in yyyy-mm-dd format, as this is the standard date format for OPENEDGE_ABL.

The {&} symbols indicate that this is a dynamic query, which means that the table and query are evaluated at runtime rather than being fixed strings.
