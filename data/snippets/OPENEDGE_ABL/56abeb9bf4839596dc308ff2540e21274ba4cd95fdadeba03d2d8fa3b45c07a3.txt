/* This program demonstrates how to use persistent procedures in OpenEdge ABL */

/* A persistent procedure can be defined as a class with properties and methods. */

/* Create a class named "Person" with two properties - "name" and "age" */

CLASS Person:

    DEFINE PRIVATE PROPERTY name AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO.
    DEFINE PRIVATE PROPERTY age AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.

END CLASS.

/* Create a method to set the name property of a Person instance */

METHOD PUBLIC VOID setName(INPUT name AS CHARACTER):

END METHOD.

/* Create a method to set the age property of a Person instance */

METHOD PUBLIC VOID setAge(INPUT age AS INTEGER):

    /* Validate that the age is between 0 and 120 */
    IF age > 0 AND age < 120 THEN DO:
        SELF:age = age.
    END.

/* Create a method to print a Person's name and age */
METHOD PUBLIC VOID printDetails():

    /* Use "MESSAGE" statement to print a string with dynamic values */
    MESSAGE "Hello, my name is " + SELF:name + " and I am " + STRING(SELF:age) + " years old.".

END METHOD.

/* Create a new instance of Person class */
DEFINE VARIABLE person AS Person NO-UNDO.

/* Set the name and age properties using the methods we created */
person:setName("John").
person:setAge(35).

/* Call the printDetails method to see the output */
person:printDetails().

/* Output: 
    Hello, my name is John and I am 35 years old.
