/* This code snippet is used to calculate the average grade of a student's four main subjects */

DEFINE VARIABLE math AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Declares math variable as an integer */
DEFINE VARIABLE science AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Declares science variable as an integer */
DEFINE VARIABLE english AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Declares english variable as an integer */
DEFINE VARIABLE history AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Declares history variable as an integer */
DEFINE VARIABLE average AS INTEGER NO-UNDO. /* Declares average variable as an integer */

/* Assign values to the variables */
ASSIGN math = 95. 
ASSIGN science = 87.
ASSIGN english = 92.
ASSIGN history = 78.

/* Calculate the average */
average = (math + science + english + history)/4.

/* Display the average grade */
DISPLAY "The average grade is" average "out of 100". 

/* OUTPUT: The average grade is 88 out of 100 */
