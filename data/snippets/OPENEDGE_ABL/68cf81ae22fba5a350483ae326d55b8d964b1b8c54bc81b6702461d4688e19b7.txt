/* This code snippet is a simple program that calculates and prints the factorial of a given number */

/* Initialize variables*/
DEFINE VARIABLE num AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.
DEFINE VARIABLE factorial AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.

/* Prompt user for number input */
PROMPT-FOR num WITH "Please enter a number: ".

/* Calculate factorial using a loop */
DO i = 1 TO num:
  IF i = 1 THEN DO:
    factorial = i.
  END.
  factorial = factorial * i.
END.

/* Print result */
DISPLAY "The factorial of " num " is: " factorial.
