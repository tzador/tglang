//This code snippet implements a 4-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) in VERILOG
//Inputs of the ALU (A,B) are 4-bit unsigned numbers. We assume the ALU has 4 control inputs (C0, C1, C2, C3). The ALU has 5 control outputs (Z, OF, UF, NF, CF).
//Z - Zero flag output, OF - Overflow flag output, UF - Underflow flag output, NF - Negative flag output, CF - Carry flag output
module ALU (input [3:0] A, input [3:0] B, input C0, input C1, input C2, input C3, output Z, output OF, output UF, output NF, output CF);
  wire [5:0] flags; //Variable to store the outputs of the control logic
  wire [3:0] sum; //Output of the arithmetic operation (sum of A and B)
  wire [3:0] difference; //Output of the arithmetic operation (difference of A and B)
  wire carry_in; //Variable to store the carry in value for the arithmetic operation
  wire carry_out; //Output of the carry flag
  assign carry_in = C3; //Set the value of carry in to the control input C3
  assign Z = flags[0]; //Assign the first bit of flags to the output Z (Zero flag)
  assign OF = flags[1]; //Assign the second bit of flags to the output OF (Overflow flag)
  assign UF = flags[2]; //Assign the third bit of flags to the output UF (Underflow flag)
  assign NF = flags[3]; //Assign the fourth bit of flags to the output NF (Negative flag)
  assign CF = flags[4]; //Assign the fifth bit of flags to the output CF (Carry flag)
  
  //Arithmetic operation: Sum
  assign sum = A + B + carry_in; //Add A, B, and the carry in value to get the sum
  assign flags[0] = (sum == 0); //Set the zero flag if the sum is equal to 0
  assign flags[1] = (carry_in && (A[3] == B[3]) && (sum[3] != A[3])); //Set the overflow flag if the carry in is 1, the sign bit of A and B are equal, but the sign bit of the sum is not equal to the sign bit of A

  assign flags[3] = sum[3]; //Set the negative flag to the sign bit of the sum
  assign carry_out = (C3 && (A[3] == B[3]) && (sum[3] != A[3])); //Set the carry out value to 1 if the control input C3 is 1, the sign bit of A and B are equal, but the sign bit of the sum is not equal to the sign bit of A
  
  //Arithmetic operation: Difference
  assign difference = A - B - (~carry_in); //Subtract B from A and subtract the complement of carry in to get the difference
  assign flags[0] = (difference == 0); //Set the zero flag if the difference is equal to 0
  assign flags[1] = (~carry_in && (A[3] != B[3]) && (difference[3] == A[3])); //Set the overflow flag if the complement of carry in is 1, the sign bit of A and B are not equal, and the sign bit of the difference is equal to the sign bit of A
  assign flags[2] = (~carry_in && (A[3] == B[3]) && (difference[3] != A[3])); //Set the underflow flag if the complement of carry in is 1, the sign bit of A and B are equal, but the sign bit of the difference is not equal to the sign bit of A
  assign flags[3] = difference[3]; //Set the negative flag to the sign bit of the difference
  assign carry_out = ((~C3) && (A[3] != B[3]) && (difference[3] == A[3])); //Set the carry out value to 1 if the complement of control input C3 is 1, the sign bit of A and B are not equal, and the sign bit of the difference is equal to the sign bit of A
  
  //Logic operation: AND
  assign flags[0:4] = A[3:0] & B[3:0]; //Set all flags to the bitwise AND of A and B
  
  //Logic operation: OR
  assign flags[0:4] = A[3:0] | B[3:0]; //Set all flags to the bitwise OR of A and B
  
  //Logic operation: XOR
  assign flags[0:4] = A[3:0] ^ B[3:0]; //Set all flags to the bitwise XOR of A and B
