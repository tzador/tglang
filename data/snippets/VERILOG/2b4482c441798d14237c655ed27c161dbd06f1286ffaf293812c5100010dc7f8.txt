/*

This code snippet is an example of a counter module in VERILOG. It takes in a clock signal and a reset signal and outputs a 4-bit count. The count increments by 1 every time the clock signal has a positive edge, unless the reset signal is high, in which case the count is reset to 0.

Here is an explanation of the code:

    - The first line defines the module name and its inputs and outputs.
    - The always block is used to create a sequential logic circuit that updates the count register on every positive edge of the clock signal or reset signal.
    - Inside the always block, an if-else statement is used to check the value of the reset signal. If it is high, the count value is set to 4'b0000 (0 in binary).
    - If the reset signal is low, then a case statement is used to check the current value of the count register and update it accordingly in the next clock cycle.
    - The default case is used to reset the count value to 0 in case it is not one of the explicitly mentioned cases.
    - The module ends with an 'endmodule' statement.
