/* This code snippet defines a module called ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), which performs various logical and arithmetic operations on two input values A and B, based on the operation code (op) provided.

The inputs are 32-bit variables A and B, and a 3-bit operation code op. The output is also a 32-bit variable named 'output'.

Inside the 'always' block, a 'case' statement is used to check the 3-bit value of 'op' and perform different operations based on its value. For example, if 'op' is 3'd0 (binary equivalent of decimal 0), then the output will be A + 4'd1, where 4'd1 is a 4-bit value representing decimal 1 in binary.

The 'default' case is used to handle any unexpected values of 'op' and output a default value of 0.

The 'endmodule' statement marks the end of the ALU module.

Note: Since VERILOG is a hardware description language, this code snippet will need to be synthesized into actual hardware in order to execute. */
