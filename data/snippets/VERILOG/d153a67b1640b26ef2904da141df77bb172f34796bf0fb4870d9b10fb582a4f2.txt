//MODULE TO PERFORM EMER TOMOGRAPHY CALCULATIONS

//Define the module with inputs and outputs
module EMTomographyCalculation (
    input wire [7:0] frequency, //input frequency data
    input wire start, //input start signal
    output reg [7:0] calculation, //output tomography calculation results
    output reg done //output done signal
);

//Define internal variables
reg [7:0] phase; //variable for phase data
reg [7:0] amplitude; //variable for amplitude data
reg [7:0] result; //variable for storing final result
reg [7:0] intermediate; //variable for intermediate calculations
reg [7:0] coefficient; //variable for coefficient data

//Define combinational logic for calculating result
always @ (posedge start) begin
    //reset variables to 0 before each calculation

    //perform calculation for each frequency data
