//This code snippet creates a circuit that takes in two 4-bit binary numbers and outputs the sum in a 5-bit binary number 

module binary_add(input [3:0] a, b, //input ports a and b which are 4-bits long
                  output [4:0] sum); //output port sum which is 5-bits long

    wire [3:0] carry; //wire for the carry bit between each bit addition

    assign {carry[3],sum[3:0]} = a[3:0] + b[3:0]; //adds the first 4 bits of a and b and assigns it to sum[3:0]
    assign {sum[4], carry[2], sum[2:0]} = a[4] + b[4] + carry[3:1]; //adds the last bit of a and b along with the carry bits and assigns it to sum[4] and sum[2:0]
