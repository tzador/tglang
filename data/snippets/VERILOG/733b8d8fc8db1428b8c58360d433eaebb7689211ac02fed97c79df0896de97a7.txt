// This module creates a combinational logic circuit that takes in a 4-bit input A and outputs the bitwise AND of A and a predefined 4-bit constant B
module bitwise_AND(input [3:0] A, output [3:0] B, output [3:0] out);

  assign out = A & B; // bitwise AND operation between A and B to generate output
