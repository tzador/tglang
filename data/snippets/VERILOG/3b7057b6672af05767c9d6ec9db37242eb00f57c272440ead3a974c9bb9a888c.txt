module NAND_gate (input A, B, output Y);

  // The NAND gate takes two inputs, A and B, and outputs the inverse of their AND operation, denoted as Y.
  // The module declaration consists of the module name, input and output variables.

  // Declaration of internal wire and assign statement using bitwise NOT operator (~) to implement NAND gate behavior.
  wire C;
  assign C = ~(A & B);

  // Output assignment statement using combinatorial logic behavior for the Y output variable.
