module adder (input reg [15:0] A, B, C, output reg [15:0] S);
  always @(A or B or C)
    begin

This code snippet creates a module called "adder" in VERILOG, with three input registers named A, B, and C, each with a width of 16 bits. The output is a register named S with a width of 16 bits as well. The purpose of this module is to add the values of A and B together, and then multiply the result by the value of C. This is achieved using the "always" block, which specifies that the code within it will always be executed whenever there is a change in the values of A, B, or C. The operation of addition is denoted by the "+" sign, and multiplication is denoted by the "*" sign. The result of this operation is then assigned to the output register S, which will update whenever there is a change in the inputs. This is a simple yet essential code snippet in VERILOG, as it showcases the use of inputs, outputs, and the "always" block to perform basic mathematical operations.
