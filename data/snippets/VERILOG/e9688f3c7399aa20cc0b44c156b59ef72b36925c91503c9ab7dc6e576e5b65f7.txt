//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This code snippet is a simple implementation of a finite state machine using
// verilog language. It takes in 4 input bits and outputs a 4 bit state value.
// The states are represented by a 4 bit binary number, with each bit
// indicating a specific state. The code also includes a reset state and a
// synchronous reset signal is used to reset the state values.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Define input and output ports
module FSM (input [3:0] in, output reg [3:0] state);

// Define internal reg variables
reg [3:0] curr_state, next_state;
reg reset;

// Synchronous reset signal
always @ (posedge clk) begin
    // If reset is high, set state to reset state (state 0000)
    if (reset)
        state <= 4'b0000;
    // Else, set the current state to the next state
    else
        state <= next_state;
end
