// This code snippet is a simple implementation of a finite state machine in Verilog.

// Defining the states of the FSM using enums
typedef enum logic [2:0] {S0, S1, S2, S3} state;

// Defining input and output variables
input clk, start;
output reg led;

// Declaring the register for holding the current state
reg [2:0] current_state, next_state;

// Initializing the current and next state to S0
initial begin
    current_state = S0;
    next_state = S0;
end

// Defining the combinational logic for changing states
always @(*) begin
    case(current_state)
