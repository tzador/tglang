//Declaring a module named "full_adder" with 3 inputs (a, b, and cin) and 2 outputs (sum and cout)
module full_adder (a, b, cin, sum, cout);

//Declaring the inputs and outputs as 1-bit wires
input a, b, cin;
output sum, cout;

//Declaring internal wires to store intermediate values
wire s1, s2, c1, c2;

//Combining the inputs and internal wires to create a full adder logic
assign s1 = a ^ b;
assign c1 = a & b;
assign s2 = s1 ^ cin;
assign c2 = s1 & cin;

//Combining the intermediate wires to calculate the sum output
assign sum = s2 ^ c1;
assign cout = c2 | (s2 & c1);
