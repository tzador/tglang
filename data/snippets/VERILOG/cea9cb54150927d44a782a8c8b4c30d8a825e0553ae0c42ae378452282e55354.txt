/*
  This is a verilog code snippet that represents a counter module.
  It has two inputs - clk (clock) and reset (active-low asynchronous reset)
  The counter counts up by one every positive edge of the clock cycle.
  If the reset signal is low, the counter is set to 0.
  The count value is output at a 4-bit port.
