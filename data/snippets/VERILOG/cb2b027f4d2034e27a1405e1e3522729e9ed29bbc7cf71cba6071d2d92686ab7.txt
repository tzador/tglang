//This is a code snippet demonstrating the use of an if-else statement in Verilog.
    //The code checks the value of a variable and performs different operations based on the condition.
    
    //Define the variable to be checked
    wire [7:0] num;
    
    //Input the value of the variable
    assign num = 5;
    
    //Check the value and perform appropriate operations
    if(num == 5) begin
        //If the value is 5, display a message
        $display("The number is equal to 5.");
    end 
    else if(num > 5) begin
        //If the value is greater than 5, increment it by 1 and display the new value
        num = num + 1;
        $display("The number is greater than 5. New value is %d.", num);
    end
    else begin
        //If the value is less than 5, decrement it by 1 and display the new value
        num = num - 1;
        $display("The number is less than 5. New value is %d.", num);
    end
    
    //Output:
    //The number is equal to 5.
