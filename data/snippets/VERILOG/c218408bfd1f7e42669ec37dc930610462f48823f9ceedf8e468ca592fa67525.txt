// This is a complex `VERILOG` code snippet that calculates the factorial of a number
module factorial (input [7:0] n, output [7:0] result);// defining a module named factorial which takes an 8-bit input and gives an 8-bit output
    reg [15:0] temp;// creating a 16-bit register to store the intermediate calculations
    assign result = temp[7:0];// assigning the 8 LSBs of the register to the output
    always @(n)// creating an always block to continuously update the output based on the input
        case(n)// creating a case statement to handle different input values
            0: temp = 1;// case for 0, as factorial of 0 is 1
            1: temp = 1;// case for 1, as factorial of 1 is 1
            7'd2 to 7'd255: temp = n * factorial(n-1);// case for numbers between 2 and 255, where the factorial is calculated recursively
            default: temp = 0;// case for any other input value, where the result will be 0
