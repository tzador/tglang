; Defines a function "list-ref" that takes in two parameters, "lst" and "n"
; Checks if "n" is greater than or equal to 0
;   Checks if "n" is less than or equal to the length of "lst" minus 1
;     If "n" is equal to 0, return the first element of "lst"
;     Else, recursively call "list-ref" on the rest of "lst" and subtract 1 from "n"
;   If "n" is greater than the length of "lst" minus 1, throw an error for index out of bounds
; Else, throw an error for index out of bounds
