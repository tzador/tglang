;;; This program calculates the factorial of a given number.
;;; Factorial can be defined as the product of all positive integers up to and including the given number.
;;; For example, factorial 5 would be 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

(define (factorial n)    ; Define a function called "factorial" that takes in a single parameter "n".
  (cond
    ((= n 0) 1)          ; If n equals 0, return 1. This is the base case for the factorial function.
    (else                ; If n does not equal 0, continue with the following code.
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))    ; Multiply n by the factorial of n-1. This will continue until the base case is reached.

(factorial 5)   ; Call the factorial function with the argument 5. This will return the factorial of 5, which is 120.
