; This function uses recursion to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
; It uses the base cases of n = 0 and n = 1 to return the first two Fibonacci numbers.
; Then for any other n, it recursively calls itself, passing in n - 1 and n - 2
; and adds the results together to get the nth Fibonacci number.
; For example, (recursive-fib 5) will return 5.
