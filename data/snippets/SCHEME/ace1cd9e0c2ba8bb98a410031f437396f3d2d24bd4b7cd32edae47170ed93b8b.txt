;; This function takes in two numbers and multiplies them together recursively
(define (recursive-multiplication n m)
  (if (= m 0) ;; Base case: anything multiplied by 0 is 0
      0 
      (+ n (recursive-multiplication n (- m 1))))) ;; Recursive call: add n to the product of n and m-1
(recursive-multiplication 5 3) ;; Output: 15
