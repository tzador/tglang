;;This is a function to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion
 
(define (factorial n)  ;This is the function definition, it takes in a number n as parameter
  (if (= n 0)         ;Checks if n is equal to 0, if yes, it returns 1 as factorial of 0 is 1
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ;If n is not equal to 0, it multiplies n with (n-1) and recursively calls the factorial function with (n-1) as parameter
 
;;Example input and output:
(factorial 5) ;Output: 120
(factorial 0) ;Output: 1
(factorial 9) ;Output: 362880
 
;;End of code snippet.
