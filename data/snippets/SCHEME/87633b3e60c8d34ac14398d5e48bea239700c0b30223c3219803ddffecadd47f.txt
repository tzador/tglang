;; This is a function that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number
;; It takes in one parameter 'n', which is the number to calculate the factorial for
(define (factorial n) 
	(cond 
		((= n 0) 1) ;if n is equal to 0, return 1
		(else (* n (factorial (- n 1)))) ;otherwise, multiply n by the result of calling the function with n-1
	)
)

;; Example of calling the factorial function with n = 5
(factorial 5)
;; Output: 120
