(define (factorial n) ; defines a function named 'factorial' that takes in one parameter, n
  (if (= n 0) ; checks if n is equal to 0 using the '=' operator
      1 ; returns 1 if n is equal to 0
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; else, multiplies n with the result of calling factorial on n-1 and returns it
