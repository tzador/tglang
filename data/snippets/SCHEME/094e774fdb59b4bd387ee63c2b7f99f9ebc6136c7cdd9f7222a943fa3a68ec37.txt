(define (factorial n) ;Defines a function named "factorial" which takes in a parameter "n"
	(if (= n 0) ;If "n" is equal to 0
		1 ;Return 1
		(* n (factorial (- n 1)))) ;Otherwise, multiply "n" by the result of calling "factorial" with "n-1" as the argument
)
(factorial 5) ;Call the "factorial" function with 5 as the argument
;; Output: 120 ;Prints the result of the factorial function, which should be 120 since 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
