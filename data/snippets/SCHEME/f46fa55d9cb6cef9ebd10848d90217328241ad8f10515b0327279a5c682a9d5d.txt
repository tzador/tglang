(define (fibonacci n) ;defines a procedure named fibonacci that takes in one parameter n
  (if (< n 2) ;conditional to check if n is less than 2
      n ;returns n if it is less than 2
      (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2))))) ;recursevily calls the fibonacci procedure with n-1 and n-2 and adds the results together
 
(fibonacci 5) ;calls the fibonacci procedure with the value 5 as the argument
;returns 5 as the 5th fibonacci number is 5
