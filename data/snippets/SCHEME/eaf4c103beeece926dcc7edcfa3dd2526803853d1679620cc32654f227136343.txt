;; Define a procedure for calculating the factorial of a number
(define (factorial n)
  (if (zero? n)             ; Check if n is equal to 0
      1                     ; Base case - the factorial of 0 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; Recursive case - multiply n with the factorial of (n-1)

;; Call the procedure with n = 5 and print the result
(display (factorial 5))     ; Output: 120
