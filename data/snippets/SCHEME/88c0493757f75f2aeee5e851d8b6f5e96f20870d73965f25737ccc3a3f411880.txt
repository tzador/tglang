;;; This is a complex function that calculates the factorial of a given number
(define (factorial n) ; This line defines a function called "factorial" that takes in one parameter "n"
  (cond ((< n 0) "ERROR: Factorial can only be calculated for positive integers") ; This checks if the input is a negative number
  	((= n 0) 1) ; This checks if the input is 0, in which case the factorial is 1
  	(else (* n (factorial (- n 1)))) ; This is the recursive step, multiplies the number with the factorial of the number minus 1

(factorial 5) ; This line calls the factorial function with an input of 5, output will be 120
