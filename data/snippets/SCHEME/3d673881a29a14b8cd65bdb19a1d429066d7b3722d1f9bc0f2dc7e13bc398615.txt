;; Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)             ; Base case: if n equals 0
      1                   ; Return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; Recursive case: multiply n with the factorial of n-1
      
;; Call the function and print the result
(display "Factorial of 5 is: ")
(display (factorial 5)) ; Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120
