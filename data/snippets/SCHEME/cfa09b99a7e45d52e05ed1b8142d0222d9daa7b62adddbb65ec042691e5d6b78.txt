;;This code snippet shows an example of a recursive function in Scheme
(define (factorial n) ; define the function for calculating factorial
  (if (= n 0) ; base case: factorial of 0 is 1
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; recursive call: factorial of n is n multiplied by factorial of n-1

(display (factorial 5)) ; calling the function and displaying the result, output should be 120

;; OUTPUT:
120
