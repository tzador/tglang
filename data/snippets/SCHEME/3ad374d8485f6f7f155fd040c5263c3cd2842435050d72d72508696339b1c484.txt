;; A function to find the minimum element in a list
(define (find-min lst)
  (if (null? (cdr lst))       ; if list only has one element
      (car lst)               
      (if (< (car lst) (find-min (cdr lst))) ; compare the first element to the minimum of the rest of the list
          (car lst)                          ; if smaller, then the first element is the new minimum
          (find-min (cdr lst)))))             ; otherwise, call the function recursively on the rest of the list

;;; Example usage
(find-min '(4 2 3 1)) ; output: 1 (the minimum element in the list is 1)
