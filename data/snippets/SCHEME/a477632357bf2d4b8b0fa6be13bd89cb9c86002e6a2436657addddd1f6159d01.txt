;; This is a function that takes in two numbers and returns the sum of their squares 
;; using the `define` keyword to define the function
(define (sum-of-squares x y) 
  ;; Using the `let` keyword to define variables within the function body 
  ;; to store intermediate results
  (let ((x-squared (* x x)) 
        (y-squared (* y y))) 
    ;; Using the `+` procedure to calculate the final sum of squares 
    (+ x-squared y-squared))) 
  
;; Calling the function with input values 3 and 4 
(sum-of-squares 3 4)

;; Output: The sum of squares for 3 and 4 is 25.
