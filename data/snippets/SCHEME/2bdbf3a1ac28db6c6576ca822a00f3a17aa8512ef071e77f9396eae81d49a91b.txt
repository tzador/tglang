(define (remove-dup list) ; defines a function called remove-dup that takes in a list as its parameter
  (cond ((null? list) list) ; checks if the list is empty, if yes, returns the empty list
        ((member? (car list) (cdr list)) ; checks if the first element of the list is also present in the rest of the list
            (remove-dup (cdr list))) ; if yes, calls the function recursively on the rest of the list
        (else ; if the first element is unique
            (cons (car list) (remove-dup (cdr list)))))); returns a new list by recursively removing any duplicate elements from the original list
