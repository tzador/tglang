(define (fibonacci n)
  ; define a recursive procedure to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
  (if (or (= n 1) (= n 2))
  ; base case: when n is 1 or 2, return 1
      1
  ; recursive case: calculate the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers
      (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))))
  ; calculate the nth Fibonacci number by calling the recursive procedure
  (print (fibonacci 10))
; expected output: 55 (which is the 10th Fibonacci number)
