(define (my-length lst) ;defines a function called "my-length" that takes in an argument "lst"
    (if (null? lst)  ;condition where lst is empty list
        0 ;if true, return 0 as the length
        (+ 1 (my-length (cdr lst))))) ;if false, recursively calls the function with the rest of the list and adds 1 to the result, giving the length of the list.
