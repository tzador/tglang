;; Defining a function that computes the factorial of a number
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)        ; If n is equal to 0
      1              ; then the factorial is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; otherwise, multiply n by the factorial of n-1

;; Testing the function with input '5'
(factorial 5) ; Output is 120, which is the factorial of 5

;; The 'define' keyword is used to define a function
;; The function name (factorial) is followed by its parameters (n)
;; The function body is enclosed in parentheses and starts with 'if'
;; The 'if' statement checks if n is equal to 0
;; If it is, then the function returns 1
;; Otherwise, the function multiplies n by the factorial of n-1
;; The '(* n (factorial (- n 1)))' expression is the recursive call to the factorial function,
;; reducing n by 1 each time until it reaches 0, thus calculating the factorial.
