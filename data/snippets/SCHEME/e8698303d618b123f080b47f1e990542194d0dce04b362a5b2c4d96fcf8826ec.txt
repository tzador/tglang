;; This is a function that calculates the factorial of a number
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0) ;; Check if the number is 0
    1 ;; Return 1 if the number is 0, since 0! = 1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ;; Multiply the number by the factorial of n-1
  )
)
;; Example call of the factorial function
(display (factorial 5)) ;; Output: 120
