; Define a function that calculates the sum of all odd numbers in a list
(define (sum-odd lst)
  ; Base case: an empty list has no odd numbers
  (if (null? lst) 0
    ; Recursive case: add the first number in the list if it is odd, and recurse with the rest of the list
    (if (odd? (car lst)) (+ (car lst) (sum-odd (cdr lst)))
      ; If the first number is even, just recurse with the rest of the list without adding anything
      (sum-odd (cdr lst)))))
