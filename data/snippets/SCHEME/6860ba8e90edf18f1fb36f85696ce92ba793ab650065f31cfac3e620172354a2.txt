;; Define a recursive function for calculating the factorial of a given number
;; Parameters:
;; n: the number whose factorial is to be calculated
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0) 1 ;; base case: factorial of 0 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ;; recursive case: multiply n by factorial of n-1
