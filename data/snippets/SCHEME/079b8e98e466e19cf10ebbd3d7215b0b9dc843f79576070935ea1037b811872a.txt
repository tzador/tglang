;; This is a function that takes in two arguments and returns the difference between them
(define (subtract x y)

;; This is a function that takes in a list as an argument and multiplies all its numbers together
(define (list-product lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      1
      (* (car lst) (list-product (cdr lst)))))

;; This is a function that calls the list-product function with the list (1 2 3 4 5)
(list-product '(1 2 3 4 5))
