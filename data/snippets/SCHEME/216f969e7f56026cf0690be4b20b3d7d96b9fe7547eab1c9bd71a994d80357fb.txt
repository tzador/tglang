;; Define a function that will recursively calculate the factorial of a given number
(define (factorial x) 
  (if (= x 0)   ;;; check if the number is zero 
      1         ;;; if yes, return 1 as the factorial of zero is 1
      (* x (factorial (- x 1))))) ;;; if not, multiply the number with the factorial of its predecessor and recurse

;; Call the factorial function with the number 5 and print the result
(display (factorial 5)) ;;; should output 120
