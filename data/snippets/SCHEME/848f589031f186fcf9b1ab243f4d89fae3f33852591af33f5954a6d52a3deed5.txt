;; This code snippet uses the define function to create a complex procedure in Scheme
(define (foo x y) ;; Defines the procedure foo and takes two parameters, x and y
    (let ((z (* x y))) ;; Creates a local variable z and assigns the product of x and y to it
        (* z z))) ;; Returns the square of z as the output of the procedure foo

(foo 5 7) ;; Calls the procedure foo with arguments 5 and 7, which will return 245
