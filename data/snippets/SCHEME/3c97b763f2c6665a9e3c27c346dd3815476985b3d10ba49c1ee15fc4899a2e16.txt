;; Function that takes in two lists and returns the length of the shorter list
(define (shorter-length l1 l2)
  (if (< (length l1) (length l2))
    (length l1)
    (length l2)
  )
)

;; Define a list with numbers 1 to 5
(define lst (list 1 2 3 4 5))

;; Call the function with two arguments - lst and another list
(shorter-length lst (list 2 4 6))

;; Output: 3
