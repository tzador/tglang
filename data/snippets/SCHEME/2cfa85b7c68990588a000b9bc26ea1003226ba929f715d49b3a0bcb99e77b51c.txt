;; This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number

(define (factorial n) 
  (if (= n 0) ;; checks if number is equal to 0
      1 ;; if so, return 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ;; if not, multiply number by the factorial of n-1
  ))

;; Example call of the function with input of 5
(factorial 5) ;; => 120
