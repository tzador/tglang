;; Define a function in Scheme that takes in two numbers, n and m, and computes the sum of all numbers between n and m (inclusive)
 
(define (sum-between n m)
    (if (<= n m)
        (+ n (sum-between (+ n 1) m))
        0))
         
(sum-between 1 10) ;; Output: 55 - sum of all numbers between 1 and 10
