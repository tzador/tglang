; The following code defines a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number

(define (factorial n)
    (if (= n 0)
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
        
; This is a comment in SCHEME
; It is used to provide additional information about the code, but does not affect the functionality

; To use the function, call it with a number as the argument
; For example, to calculate the factorial of 5:

(factorial 5)

; This will return the result: 120
