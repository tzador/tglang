;;Definition of find-max function
(define (find-max lst) ;defines a function named find-max that takes in a list as input
(if (null? (cdr lst)) ;checks if the list has only 1 element
    (car lst) ;if true, returns the element as the maximum value
    (if (< (car lst) (find-max (cdr lst))) ;if false, recursively calls the function with the sublist and compares the first element to the maximum of the sublist
        (find-max (cdr lst)) ;if the first element is less than the maximum of the sublist, the maximum of the sublist is returned
        (car lst)))) ;if the first element is the maximum, it is returned as the maximum value of the list
