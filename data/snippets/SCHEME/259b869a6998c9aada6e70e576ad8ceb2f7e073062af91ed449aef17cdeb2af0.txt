(define (factorial n) ;Defines a function called "factorial" that takes in a parameter n
  (if (<= n 1) ;Checks if the parameter n is less than or equal to 1
      1 ;If true, returns 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ;If false, multiplies n with the factorial of n-1 and recursively calls the function again
