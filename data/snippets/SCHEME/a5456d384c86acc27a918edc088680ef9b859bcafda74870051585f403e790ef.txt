;; This is a recursive function that calculates the Nth term in the Fibonacci sequence

(define (fibonacci n) ; Define the procedure
  (if (<= n 2) ; Check if n is less than or equal to 2
      1 ; if true, return 1
      (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2))))) ; if false, recursively call the function to calculate the Nth term by adding together the 2 previous terms

(fibonacci 10) ; Call the function to calculate the 10th term in the Fibonacci sequence
