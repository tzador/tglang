;; first we define a function that takes in two numbers, adds them, and returns the sum
(define (add x y)
  (+ x y))

;; next we define a higher-order function that takes in a function and two numbers
(define (higher-order-func func x y)
  ;; we call the function passed in, with the two numbers as arguments
  (func x y))

;; now we can use our higher-order function to add two numbers
;; we pass in our 'add' function as the first argument
(higher-order-func add 3 4)
