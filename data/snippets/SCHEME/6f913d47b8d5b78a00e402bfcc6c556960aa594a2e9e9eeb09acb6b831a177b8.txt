Factorial of a number is defined as the product of all numbers from 1 to that number.
In this code snippet, the function 'factorial' takes in a parameter 'n' and checks if it is equal to 0.
If n is equal to 0, the function returns 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1.
If n is not equal to 0, the function multiplies n with the factorial of n-1 and recursively calls itself until n is equal to 0. This ultimately calculates the factorial of the given number.
The code snippet also includes an example call to the function, where the factorial of 5 is calculated, which outputs the result 120.
