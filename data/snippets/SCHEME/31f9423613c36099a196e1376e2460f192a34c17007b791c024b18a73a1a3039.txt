a commented code snippet in SCHEME
;;; This code snippet defines a factorial function which takes in an argument n and returns the factorial value of n. The function makes use of recursion to calculate the factorial value.

   ;;; Checks if n is equal to 0, if true, returns 1 since 0! is defined as 1.

      ;;; If n is not 0, multiplies n with the factorial value of (n-1) using recursion.
