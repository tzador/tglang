(define (factorial x) ; Defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number
  (if (= x 0) ; Checks if the input is 0
      1 ; If it is 0, returns 1 as factorial of 0 is 1
      (* x (factorial (- x 1))))) ; If not 0, multiplies input with the factorial of (input-1) and recurses until input is 0
  ; Example: factorial(5) will be calculated as 5*4*3*2*1 which is 120
