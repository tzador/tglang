;;; Section 1.1.6

(define (sum-of-squares x y) ;;; defines a procedure that takes two parameters, x and y
  (+ (square x) (square y))) ;;; returns the sum of the squares of x and y
(define (square x) ;;; defines a procedure that takes one parameter, x
  (* x x)) ;;; returns x multiplied by itself
(define (bigger a b) ;;; defines a procedure that takes two parameters, a and b
  (if (> a b) ;;; checks if a is bigger than b
      a ;;; if true, returns a
      b)) ;;; if false, returns b
(bigger (sum-of-squares 3 4) (square (smaller (3 4) 2))) ;;; calls the bigger procedure with the sum of squares of 3 and 4 and the square of smaller of 3 and 4 and 2 as parameters.
