;; This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the product of all the numbers in the list.
(define (product lst)
  (cond
    ((null? lst) 1) ; If the list is empty, return 1.
    (else (* (car lst) (product (cdr lst)))) ; Multiply the first element with the product of the rest of the list.
  )
)

;; Example input and output:
(product (list 1 2 3 4)) ; Output: 24
(product (list 5 6)) ; Output: 30
