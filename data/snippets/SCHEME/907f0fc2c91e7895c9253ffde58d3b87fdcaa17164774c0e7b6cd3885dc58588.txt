;; Definition of a function that checks if a number is prime or not
(define (is-prime? n)
  (cond ((< n 2) #f) ; Base Case: All numbers less than 2 are not prime
        ((= n 2) #t) ; Base Case: 2 is the only even prime number
        ((= (modulo n 2) 0) #f) ; Any even number other than 2 is not prime
        (else (let loop ((i 3))
                (cond ((> i (sqrt n)) #t) ; Check if all possible factors have been tested
                      ((= (modulo n i) 0) #f) ; If number is divisible by i, it is not prime
                      (else (loop (+ i 2)))))))) ; Increase i by 2 to check for only odd numbers
