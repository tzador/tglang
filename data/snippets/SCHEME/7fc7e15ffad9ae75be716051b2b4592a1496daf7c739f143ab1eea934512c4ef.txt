;; Define factorial function
(define factorial
  (lambda (n)
    ;; Use if-statement to check if n is 0 or 1
    (if (or (= n 0) (= n 1))
      ;; If so, return 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
      1
      ;; If not, use recursive call to calculate factorial of n-1 and multiply by n
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))

;; Call factorial function with input of 5
(factorial 5) ;Output: 120
