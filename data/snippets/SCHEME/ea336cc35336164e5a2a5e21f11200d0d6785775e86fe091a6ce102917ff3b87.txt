(define (factorial n) ; defines a function named factorial that takes in an argument n
  (if (= n 0) 1 ; uses an if statement to check if n is equal to zero
      1 ; if n equals zero, returns 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; if n is not equal to zero, multiplies n by the result of the factorial function with n-1 as the argument
