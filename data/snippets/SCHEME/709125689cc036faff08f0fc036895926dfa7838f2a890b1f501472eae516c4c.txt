`(define (finonacci n)
  (if (>= n 2)
      (+ (finonacci (- n 1)) (finonacci (- n 2)))
      1))`

This code snippet defines a function named `finonacci` in the SCHEME programming language. The function takes in a parameter `n` and calculates the n-th term of the Fibonacci sequence.
The function uses recursion to calculate the n-th term by adding the previous two terms in the sequence.
The function has a base case where if `n` is less than 2, it will return 1 to account for the first two terms in the sequence.
The function uses the `if` statement to check if `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and if so, recursively calls itself with `n` decreased by 1 and 2, respectively.
The output of this code snippet would be the n-th term of the Fibonacci sequence calculated by the `finonacci` function.
