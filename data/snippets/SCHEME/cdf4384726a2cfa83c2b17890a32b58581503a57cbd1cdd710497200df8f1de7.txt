;; This is a function that computes the factorial of a number 

(define (factorial n)                    ; Define the factorial function
  (if (= n 0)                           ; Check if n is equal to 0
    1                                  ; If yes, return 1 and stop
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))         ; If not, multiply n with the factorial of n-1

;; Example usage

(factorial 5)                           ; Output: 120 (5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)

(factorial 0)                           ; Output: 1 (0! = 1)

;; This is a recursive function as it calls itself within its own body to compute the factorial.
;; It uses the base case of n = 0 to stop the recursion and return the final value.
