(define (fib n) ; defining a function to calculate the nth fibonacci number
  (if (<= n 1) ; if n is less than or equal to 1, return n
      n
      (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2))))) ; else, recursively call fib on n-1 and n-2 and add them together

(fib 10) ; calling the fib function with 10 as the argument, should return the 10th fibonacci number (55)
