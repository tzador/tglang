;; Define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1) ; Base case: factorial of 1 is 1
      1        ; Exit recursion and return 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
      ; Recursive case: multiply the number with the factorial of n-1 and repeat until n = 1
