 .
;; This code defines a recursive function in SCHEME that takes in an argument n and calculates its factorial value.
;; The function checks if n is equal to 0 and if so, returns 1 as the base case.
;; If n is not equal to 0, it recursively calls the factorial function again with n decremented by 1 and multiplies the result by n.
;; The function continues to call itself until n reaches 0, at which point it returns the final factorial value.
;;
;; Example:
;; Input: (factorial 5)
;; Output: 120
