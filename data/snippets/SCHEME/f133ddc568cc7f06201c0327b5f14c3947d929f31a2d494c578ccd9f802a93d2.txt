;; Define a procedure to calculate the factorial of a number
(define (factorial x)
  (if (< x 2) ; base case
      1 ; return 1
      (* x (factorial (- x 1))) ; recursive case - multiply current number by (current number - 1)
    )
  )

;; Call the factorial procedure with an input of 5 and print the result
(display (factorial 5))
;; Output: 120
