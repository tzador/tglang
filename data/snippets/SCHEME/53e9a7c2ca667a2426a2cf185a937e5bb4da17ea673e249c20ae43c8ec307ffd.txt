;; This is a recursive function in Scheme that returns the sum of all numbers
;; from 1 to the specified input number n. 

(define (sum n)
  (if (= n 0) ;;; base case, sum of 0 is 0
      0
      (+ n (sum (- n 1))))) ;;; recursive call to sum all numbers from 1 to n-1 and add to n
;; Example usage:
(sum 10) ;;; Returns 55, which is the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10.
