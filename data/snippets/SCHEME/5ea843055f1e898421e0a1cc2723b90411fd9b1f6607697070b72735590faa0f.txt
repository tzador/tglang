(define (factorial n)   ; This is a procedure for calculating the factorial of a number
  (if (<= n 1)   ; Checks if n is less than or equal to 1
      1   ; Returns 1 if n is 0 or 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))   ; Recursively multiplies n by the factorial of n-1
      ; E.g. factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4) = 5 * 4 * factorial(3) = 5 * 4 * 3 * factorial(2) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
      ; The procedure will keep recursing until n = 0 and then return the final product
