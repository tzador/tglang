;; This code snippet uses the Scheme programming language
;; to create a function that calculates the average
(define (calculate-average lst)
  (cond ((= (length lst) 0) 0) ;; if the list is empty, return 0 as the average
        (else (/ (apply + lst) (length lst))) ;; otherwise, divide the sum of all elements by the total number of elements
        )
