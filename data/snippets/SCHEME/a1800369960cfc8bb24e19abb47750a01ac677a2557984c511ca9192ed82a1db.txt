(define (factorial n) ; define a function named factorial that takes in an argument 'n'
  (if (zero? n) ; checks if n is equal to 0
      1 ; if n is equal to 0, return 1 (base case)
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; if n is not equal to 0, return the product of n and the factorial of n-1 (recursive case)

(factorial 5) ; calls the function factorial with an input of 5 and returns the factorial of 5, which is 120
