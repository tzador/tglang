;; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
(define (factorial x) ;; creates a function named "factorial" that takes in a single parameter
  (if (<= x 1) ;; checks if the input is less than or equal to 1
      1 ;; returns 1 if the input is 0 or 1
      (* x (factorial (- x 1)))) ;; multiplies the input with the output of calling factorial with x-1 as the input
