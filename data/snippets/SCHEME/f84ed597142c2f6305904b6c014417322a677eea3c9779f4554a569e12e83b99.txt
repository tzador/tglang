;; This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
(define (factorial n)
  ;; Base case when n is 0, return 1
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      ;; Recursive case, multiply n with the factorial of n-1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
      
;; Example call to the factorial function with input 5
(factorial 5)
