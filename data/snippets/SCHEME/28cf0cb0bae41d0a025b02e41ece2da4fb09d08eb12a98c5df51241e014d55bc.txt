;; Define a procedure that counts the number of elements in a list
(define (count-elements lst)
  (cond ((null? lst) 0)                       ; base case, list is empty
        (else (+ 1 (count-elements (cdr lst))) ; add 1 and recursively call procedure on the remaining list
        )
  )
)

;; Example calls and expected output:
(count-elements '())  ; Output: 0
(count-elements '(1 2 3))  ; Output: 3
