; Calculate the area of a circle given its radius
;
(define (circle-area radius) ; Define a procedure called circle-area that takes in a parameter called radius
  (* pi (* radius radius))) ; Multiply pi with the square of the radius to get the area of the circle

; Define a variable called 'radius' with a value of 5
(define radius 5)

; Call the circle-area procedure and pass in the 'radius' variable as an argument
(circle-area radius)

; Output: 78.53981633974483 (area of circle with radius 5)
