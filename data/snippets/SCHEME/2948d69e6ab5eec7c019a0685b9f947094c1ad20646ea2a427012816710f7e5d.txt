;; Define function for calculating factorial
(define (factorial x)
  (cond 
    ((= x 0) 1) ;; Base case, return 1 when x is 0
    (else (* x (factorial (- x 1)))))) ;; Recursive case, multiply x with the factorial of x-1

;; Main function for calculating sum of factorials
(define (sum-factorials n)
  (cond
    ((= n 0) 1) ;; Base case, when n is 0, return 1
    (else (+ (factorial n) (sum-factorials (- n 1)))))) ;; Recursive case, add factorial of n with the sum of factorials of n-1

;; Example usage
(display (sum-factorials 5)) ;; Output: 153
