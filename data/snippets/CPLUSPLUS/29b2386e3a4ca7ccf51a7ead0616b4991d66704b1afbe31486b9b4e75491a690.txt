// This is a code snippet that defines a function to calculate the nth term of the fibonacci sequence.
// It uses a recursive approach and has a time complexity of O(2^n). 

// Function to calculate the nth term of the fibonacci sequence
int fibonacci(int n)

    // Base case - first and second terms are 0 and 1
    if(n == 0)
        return 0;
    else if(n == 1)
        return 1;

    // Recursive case - calculate nth term using recursive calls
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

// Driver code to test the fibonacci function
int main()
{
    // Input the value of n
    int n;

    cin >> n;

    // Calculate the nth term and print the result
