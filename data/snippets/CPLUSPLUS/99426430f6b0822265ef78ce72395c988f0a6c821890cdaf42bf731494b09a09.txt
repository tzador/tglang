/*
This is a complex C++ code snippet that performs calculation and output based on user input.
First, we declare the necessary variables for user input and output, as well as a counter variable.
*/
int num, sum = 0, i;

/*
Next, we prompt the user to enter the desired number of inputs and store it in the 'num' variable.
*/
cout << "Enter the number of inputs: ";
cin >> num;

/*
Then, we use a for loop to iterate through all the numbers entered by the user.
We also use the counter variable to keep track of the current iteration.
*/
for (i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    int input;

    /*
    Within the loop, we prompt the user to enter each input and store it in the 'input' variable.
    */
    cout << "Enter input #" << i << ": ";
    cin >> input;

    /*
    We perform a calculation on the input and add it to the current sum.
    */
    sum += input;
}

/*
Finally, we output the calculated sum and a goodbye message to the user.
*/
cout << "The sum of the inputs is: " << sum << endl;
cout << "Thank you for using our program!";

/*
Sample output:
Enter the number of inputs: 5
Enter input #1: 2
Enter input #2: 5
Enter input #3: 8
Enter input #4: 3
Enter input #5: 1
The sum of the inputs is: 19
Thank you for using our program!
