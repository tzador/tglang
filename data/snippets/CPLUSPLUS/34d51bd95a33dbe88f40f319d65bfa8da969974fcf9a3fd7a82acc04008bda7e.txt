/*
  This function takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
  The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with 0 and 1.
  For example, the first six numbers in the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, so the 6th Fibonacci number is 5.
  This function uses recursion to compute the Fibonacci number, continuously calling itself with smaller values until it reaches the base case (n = 0 or 1).
