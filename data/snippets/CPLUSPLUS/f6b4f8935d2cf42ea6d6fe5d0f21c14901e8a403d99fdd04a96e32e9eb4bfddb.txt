//This is a function that finds the average of two numbers
float findAverage(float num1, float num2)
{
    float sum = num1 + num2; //calculating the sum of the two numbers
    float average = sum / 2; //calculating the average
    return average; //returning the average
}

//Code snippet for using the findAverage function
int main()
{
    float a = 5.5;
    float b = 7.8;
    float avg = findAverage(a, b); //calling the findAverage function
    cout << "The average of " << a << " and " << b << " is: " << avg << endl; //printing the average
    return 0;
}

//Output: The average of 5.5 and 7.8 is: 6.65
