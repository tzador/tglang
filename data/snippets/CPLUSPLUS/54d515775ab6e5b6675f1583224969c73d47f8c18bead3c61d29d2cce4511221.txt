/*
This is a complex code snippet that includes many features and syntax of the C++ programming language.
It declares and initializes multiple variables, uses control structures such as if-else statements and for-loops,
performs mathematical calculations, and outputs results to the console.
It also includes comments to explain each step of the code.
