/*
  This program takes a positive integer as input and checks whether it is a perfect square.
  A perfect square is a number which, when multiplied by itself, gives a whole number as the result.
  The program uses a binary search algorithm to find the square root of the input number.
  It prints "Input number is a perfect square." if the input number is a perfect square,
  or "Input number is not a perfect square." if the input number is not a perfect square.
