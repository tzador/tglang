(* A recursive function to find the sum of a list of integers *)
let rec sum_list ints =
  match ints with
    | [] -> 0 (* return 0 if list is empty *)
    | x::xs -> x + sum_list xs (* add current integer to sum of remaining list *)

(* An example list for testing *)
let test_list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]

(* Printing the sum of the list *)
let sum = sum_list test_list
print_endline(string_of_int sum) (* print the sum as a string *)

(* Output: 15 *)
