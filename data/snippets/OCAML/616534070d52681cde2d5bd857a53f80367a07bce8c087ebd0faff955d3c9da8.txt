(*
This is a recursive function in OCAML that calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci Sequence.
- n is the input parameter, representing the desired term in the sequence.
- The match statement handles the base cases of 0 and 1, both of which return the value itself.
- For any other value of n, the function makes a recursive call to calculate the two previous terms and adds them together.
- The semi-colon at the end is used to end the function declaration.
