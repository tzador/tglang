(** This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion *)

let rec factorial n = 
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1 (* Base case, return 1 when n is 0 *)
  | _ -> n * factorial (n - 1) (* Recursive call, multiply n by the factorial of n-1 *)

let result = factorial 5;; (* Calling the function with n = 5, this will return the factorial of 5 *) 

(* Output: 
120
*)
