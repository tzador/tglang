(* This code snippet creates a function that checks whether a given number is prime or not *)

(* Define a function to check if a number is prime *)
let is_prime x = 

    (* Define a helper function to check if a number is divisible by a given divisor *)
    let rec is_divisible x divisor = 
        (* Base case: if divisor is equal to 1, the number is not divisible by anything other than itself *)
        if divisor = 1 then false 
        (* Recursive case: check if the number is divisible by the current divisor, if not, check next divisor *)
        else if x mod divisor = 0 then true 
        else is_divisible x (divisor - 1) in 

    (* Call the helper function, starting with the number itself as the divisor and decreasing *)
    is_divisible x x;;

(* Call the function to check if a certain number (in this case, 17) is prime *)
is_prime 17;; (* Returns true, indicating that 17 is a prime number *)
