(** 
   This is a simple function that takes in a list of integers and returns 
   the sum of all odd numbers in the list. 
   
   @param lst the list of integers to be summed 
   @returns the sum of all odd numbers in lst 
*) 
  
let rec sum_odd_numbers lst = 
  match lst with 
  | [] -> 0    (* base case: empty list *) 
  | x::xs -> 
      if x mod 2 = 1 then x + sum_odd_numbers xs 
      else sum_odd_numbers xs 
        
let lst = [1;2;3;4;5;6] 
let sum = sum_odd_numbers lst (* sum is 9 *)
