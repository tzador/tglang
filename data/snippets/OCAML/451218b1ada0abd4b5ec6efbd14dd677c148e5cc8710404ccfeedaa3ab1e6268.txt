(* A recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number *)
let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1 (* Base case - factorial of 0 is 1 *)
  | _ -> n * factorial (n-1) (* Recursive call using tail call optimization *)

(* A function to print the factorial of a given number *)
let print_factorial n =
  let result = factorial n in (* Call the factorial function *)
  Printf.printf "Factorial of %d is %d\n" n result (* Print the result *)

(* Call the print_factorial function with the argument 5 *)
print_factorial 5
