(* This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the maximum value in the list *)
let rec max_value (lst: int list) : int =
  match lst with
  | [] -> failwith "empty list" (* if the list is empty, fail with an error message *)
  | [x] -> x (* if the list contains only one element, return that element *)
  | x :: xs -> max x (max_value xs) (* else, compare the first element to the maximum value in the rest of the list *)

(* Example usage *)
max_value [1; 5; 2; 3] (* returns 5 *)
