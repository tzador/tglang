(* This is a simple function that takes in a list of integers and returns their sum. *)
let rec sum_list lst =
match lst with       (* match statement to check different cases *)
| [] -> 0           (* base case - if list is empty, sum is 0 *)
| h::t -> h + sum_list t  (* recursive case - add head of list to sum of rest of list *)
