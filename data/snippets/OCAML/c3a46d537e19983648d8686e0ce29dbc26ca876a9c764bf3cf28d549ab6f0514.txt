(* This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number using recursion *)

(* Define a recursive function named factorial that takes in a number n *)
let rec factorial n =

(* Check if n is equal to 0 and if so, return 1 *)
if n = 0 then 1

(* If n is not 0, call the factorial function again with n-1 and multiply it with n *)
else factorial (n-1) * n

(* Call the factorial function with an input of 5 and print the result *)
print_endline(string_of_int(factorial 5)) (* Output: 120 *)
