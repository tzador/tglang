(* This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number *)

let rec factorial n =              (* define the function, with input parameter n *)
  if n < 2 then 1                  (* if n is less than 2, return 1 (base case) *)
  else n * factorial (n-1)        (* else, multiply n by the factorial of n-1, and repeat *)

(* This is an example call to the factorial function *)

let result = factorial 5           (* call the function with input value of 5 *)
(* Output: result = 120 *)          (* print the result, which should be 120 (5*4*3*2*1) *)
