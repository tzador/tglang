(* This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns a new list with the original list reversed *)

let rev_list lst =
  let rec aux acc = function
    | [] -> acc
    | h::t -> aux (h::acc) t in
  aux [] lst ;;

(* Test the function by calling it with a sample list *)

rev_list [1;2;3;4;5];; (* Output: [5;4;3;2;1] *)
