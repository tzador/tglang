(** This is a function that takes in two parameters, 'x' and 'y'.
It then returns a list of the sum of each element in 'x' with its corresponding element in 'y'. *)
let rec sum_list x y =
    match x, y with
    | [], _ -> []
    | _, [] -> []
    | x_hd :: x_tl, y_hd :: y_tl -> (x_hd + y_hd) :: (sum_list x_tl y_tl)
    ;;

(* An example call of the function *)
sum_list [1; 2; 3] [4; 5; 6];;
(* Output: [5; 7; 9] *)
