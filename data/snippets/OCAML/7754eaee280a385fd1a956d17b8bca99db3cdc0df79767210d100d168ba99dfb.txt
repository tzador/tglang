@param lst1 The first list to compare
@param lst2 The second list to compare
@return A new list containing elements of the first list that are not in the second list

  match lst1 with
  | [] -> []
  | hd :: tl ->
    if List.mem hd lst2 then compare_lists tl lst2
    else hd :: compare_lists tl lst2
