(* This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number *)
let rec factorial n = match n with
  | 0 -> 1 (* Base case, factorial of 0 is 1 *)
  | _ -> n * factorial (n - 1) (* Recursive call to calculate factorial *)

let result = factorial 5;; (* Calculating factorial of 5 *)
Printf.printf "The factorial of 5 is %d" result;; (* Printing the result *)

(* Output: The factorial of 5 is 120 *)
