(*This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number*)

let rec factorial n = (*this line defines the factorial function*)
  if n = 0 then 1 (*if the input is 0, the factorial is 1*)
  else n * factorial (n-1) (*otherwise, multiply the input by the factorial of (n-1)*)

(*calling the function with an input of 5*)
factorial 5 (*output should be 120, the factorial of 5*)
