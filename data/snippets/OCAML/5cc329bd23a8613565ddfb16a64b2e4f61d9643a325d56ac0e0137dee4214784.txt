(* A recursive function that calculates the sum of the first n numbers *)
(** [sum n acc] calculates the sum of the first n numbers, with
 * the accumulator [acc] keeping track of the total sum so far. *)
let rec sum n acc =
  if n <= 0 then acc
  else sum (n - 1) (acc + n)

(* An example call of the function *)
sum 10 0 (* Output: 55 *)
