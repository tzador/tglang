(* This is a recursive function in OCAML that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the elements in the list *)
let rec sum_list l = 
  match l with 
  | [] -> 0  (* Base case: if list is empty, return 0 *)
  | x::xs -> x + sum_list xs  (* Recursive case: add first element to sum of remaining list *)
