(* This is a recursive function that checks if a given list of numbers is sorted in ascending order *)
(* Input: lst - A list of numbers *)
(* Output: bool - True if the list is sorted in ascending order, False otherwise *)

  | [] -> true (* An empty list is always sorted *)
  | [_] -> true (* A list with one element is always sorted *)
