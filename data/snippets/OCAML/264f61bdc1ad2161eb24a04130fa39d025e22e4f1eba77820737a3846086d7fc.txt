(*
This is a recursive function that returns the factorial of a given number, n.
@param n : int - the number whose factorial is to be calculated.
@return : int - the factorial of n.
*)

let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1  (* Base case, return 1 when n is 0 *)
  | 1 -> 1  (* Base case, return 1 when n is 1 *)
  | _ -> n * factorial (n - 1)  (* Recursive call to calculate factorial of n-1 *)

(* Example usage *)
let n = 5 in
let result = factorial n in
print_int result  (* Output: 120 (factorial of 5) *)
