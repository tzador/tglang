(* This is a program that calculates the factorial of a number *)

(* Function to calculate factorial recursively *)
let rec factorial n =
  if n = 0 then 1
  else n * factorial (n-1)

(* Function to get user input and convert to integer *)
let get_input () =
  print_string "Enter a number: ";
  read_line () |> int_of_string

(* Main program *)
let () =
  let n = get_input () in
  let result = factorial n in
  print_endline ("Factorial of " ^ string_of_int(n) ^ " is " ^ string_of_int(result))
