(* Quicksort function that takes in an array of integers and sorts them in ascending order *)
let rec quicksort arr =
    match arr with
    | [] -> []
    | x::xs -> let smaller, larger =
                List.partition (fun y -> y < x) xs
                in quicksort smaller @ [x] @ quicksort larger;;
                

(* Example usage *)
let unsorted_arr = [4; 2; 9; 1; 6]
let sorted_arr = quicksort unsorted_arr;;

(* Output: [1; 2; 4; 6; 9] *)
