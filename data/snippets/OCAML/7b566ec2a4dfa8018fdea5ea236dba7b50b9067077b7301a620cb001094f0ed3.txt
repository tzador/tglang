(* This is an annotated code snippet in OCAML *)
(* We define a function that takes in an integer and returns its factorial *)
let rec factorial (n:int) : int =
  (* We check if n is equal to 0 *)
  if n = 0 then
    (* If n is 0, return 1 *)
    1
  else
    (* If n is not 0, recursively call the factorial function with n-1 and multiply it by n *)
    n * factorial (n-1)

(* We call the factorial function with input 5 *)
factorial 5
