(* Defines a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number *)
let rec factorial x =
    if x = 0 then 1 (* base case: factorial of 0 is 1 *)
    else x * (factorial (x - 1)) (* recursive case: multiply x by the factorial of x-1 *)
    
(* Example usage *)
factorial 5 ;; (* Output: 120 *)
