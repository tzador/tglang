(* This program finds the sum of the first n natural numbers *)

(* Declaring a function that takes the number n as input and returns the sum *)
let rec sum n =
  if n = 0 then 0
  else n + sum (n-1) (* Recursive call to the sum function *)

  (* Prompting the user to enter a number *)
  print_string "Enter a positive integer: ";

  (* Getting user input and converting it to an integer *)
  let input = read_line() in
  let num = int_of_string input in

  (* Calling the sum function with the user input as an argument *)
  let result = sum num in

  (* Displaying the result to the user *)
  print_string "The sum of the first ";
  print_int num;
  print_string " natural numbers is ";
  print_int result;
  print_string "\n";

  (* Output: The sum of the first n natural numbers is calculated and displayed *)
  (* Example: The sum of the first 5 natural numbers is 15 *)
