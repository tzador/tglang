(* This is a function that finds the maximum value in a list of integers. *)
let rec max_list = function
  | [] -> failwith "Empty list" (* If the list is empty, throw an exception *)
  | [x] -> x (* If there is only one element in the list, it is the maximum *)
  | x :: xs -> max x (max_list xs) (* Compare the first element to the maximum of the rest of the list *)

(* This is a helper function that compares two integer values and returns the maximum *)
let max a b =
  if a > b then a else b (* If a is greater than b, return a. Otherwise, return b *)

(* This is an example of using the function to find the maximum value in a list of integers *)
let result = max_list [5; 3; 7; 2; 9] (* Call the function with the list of integers *)
(* The result will be 9, the maximum value in the list *)
