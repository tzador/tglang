(* This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number *)

let rec factorial(n) = (* Declare a recursive factorial function *)
  match n with (* Pattern match the given number *)
  | 0 -> 1 (* When n = 0, return 1 *)
  | 1 -> 1 (* When n = 1, return 1 *)
  | _ -> n * factorial(n - 1) (* For any other n, return n multiplied by the factorial of n-1 *)

(* Example usage *)
let result = factorial 5 (* Call factorial function with 5 as input *)
(* Output: result = 120 *)
