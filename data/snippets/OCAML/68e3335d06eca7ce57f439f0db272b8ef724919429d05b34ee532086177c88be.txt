(* This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given integer n *)
let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1 (* base case, return 1 when n is 0 *)
  | 1 -> 1 (* base case, return 1 when n is 1 *)
  | n -> n * factorial (n-1) (* recursive call, multiply n by factorial of n-1 *)

(* Example call: factorial 5 = 120 *)
