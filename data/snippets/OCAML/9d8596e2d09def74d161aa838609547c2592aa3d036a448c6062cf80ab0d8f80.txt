(* Declaration of a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number *)
let rec factorial n =
  if n = 0 then 1      (* Base case: if n is 0, factorial is 1 *)
  else n * factorial (n - 1)  (* Recursive case: n * factorial of n-1 *)
  
(* Example usage of the factorial function *)
let result = factorial 5;;  (* This should output 120 (5! = 120) *)

(* Output:
val factorial : int -> int = <fun>  (* The function takes in an int and outputs an int *)
val result : int = 120  (* The result of calling factorial on 5 *)
