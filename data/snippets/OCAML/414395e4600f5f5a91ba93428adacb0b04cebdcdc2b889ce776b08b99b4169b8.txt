(** This function takes in a list of integers and returns a new list where every other element is doubled and every other element is divided by 2. *)

let double_divide = fun lst -> 
    let rec helper result lst = 
        match lst with 
        | [] -> List.rev result 
        | [x] -> List.rev (x / 2 :: result) 
        | hd :: x :: tl -> helper ((2 * hd) :: (x / 2) :: result) tl 
    in helper [] lst

(* Example input and output *)
let list = [1;2;3;4;5;6;7]

let result = double_divide list
(* Output: [0; 2; 1; 4; 2; 6; 3] *)
