(* This is a function that iteratively calculates the sum of a given list of integers *)
let rec sum list =
    if list = [] then 0 (* base case: empty list has sum of 0 *)
    else
        let first = List.hd list in  (* get first element of list *)
        let rest = List.tl list in  (* get rest of list *)
        first + sum rest (* add first element to sum of rest of list *)

(* Example usage *)
let myList = [1; 2; 3; 4]
let mySum = sum myList (* mySum is now 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)*)
