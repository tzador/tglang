(* This is a function that takes in a list and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the element and its index in the original list. *)
let enumerate lst =
  let rec helper lst start =
    match lst with
    | [] -> []
    | h :: t -> (h, start) :: helper t (start+1) in
  helper lst 0
  
(* Example usage *)
let lst = ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"]
enumerate lst

(* Output: [(a,0); (b,1); (c,2); (d,3)] *)
