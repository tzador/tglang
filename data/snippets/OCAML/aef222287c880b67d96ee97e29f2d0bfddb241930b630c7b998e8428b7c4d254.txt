(** This is a function that takes in two lists of integers and returns the sum of their elements **)

let rec list_sum lst1 lst2 =
  match lst1, lst2 with
  | [], [] -> 0
  | [], _ | _, [] -> failwith "Lists must have same length"
  | h1::t1, h2::t2 -> h1 + h2 + list_sum t1 t2
  ;;
  (*This function uses pattern matching to recursively sum the elements of the two lists until the base case is reached.*)
