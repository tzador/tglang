(** This function takes in a list of integers and returns
    a new list where each element is multiplied by 2. 
    @param lst: a list of integers
    @return: a new list with elements multiplied by 2 *)
let rec double_list lst = 
  match lst with
  | [] -> []
  | h::t -> (2 * h) :: double_list t

(* Example usage *)
let lst1 = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
let doubled_lst = double_list lst1 ;;
(* Output: doubled_lst = [2; 4; 6; 8; 10] *)
