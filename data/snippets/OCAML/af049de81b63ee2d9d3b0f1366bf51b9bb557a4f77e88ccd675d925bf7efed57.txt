(** This is a recursive function in OCaml that calculates the factorial of a given integer *)

let rec factorial n =
    if n = 0 then 1                (* base case, factorial of 0 is 1 *)
    else n * factorial (n-1);;     (* recursive case, multiply n by factorial of n-1 *)
    
(* Example: factorial 5 will return 120 *) (* comment for example *)
