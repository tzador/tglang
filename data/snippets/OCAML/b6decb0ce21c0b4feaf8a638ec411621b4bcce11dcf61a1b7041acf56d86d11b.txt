(* This is a code snippet in OCAML *)

(* Defining a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number *)
let rec factorial n =
  if n = 0 then 1 (* Base case, return 1 when n is 0 *)
  else n * factorial (n-1) (* Recursive call, multiplying n with the factorial of n-1 *)

(* Defining a list containing the numbers whose factorial needs to be calculated *)
let num_list = [5; 10; 3; 7]

(* Mapping the factorial function over the list and storing the result in a new list *)
let factorial_list = List.map factorial num_list

(* Printing the original list and the list of factorials in a formatted string *)
Printf.printf "The list of numbers: %s\nThe list of factorials: %s" (String.concat ", " (List.map string_of_int num_list)) (String.concat ", " (List.map string_of_int factorial_list))

(** Output:
The list of numbers: 5, 10, 3, 7
The list of factorials: 120, 3628800, 6, 5040
