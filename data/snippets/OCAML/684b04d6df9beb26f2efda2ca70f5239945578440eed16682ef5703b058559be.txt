(* A function for calculating the factorial of a number using recursion *)

(* Defines the function 'factorial' with one parameter, 'n' *)
let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  (* If n is 0, the factorial is 1 *)
  | 0 -> 1
  (* Otherwise, recursively multiply n by the factorial of n-1 *)
  | n -> n * factorial (n - 1)
