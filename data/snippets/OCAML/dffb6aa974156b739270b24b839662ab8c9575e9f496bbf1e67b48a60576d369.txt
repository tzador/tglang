(* Define a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number n *)

let rec factorial n =
  (* Base case: factorial of 0 is 1 *)
  if n = 0 then 1
  (* Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)! *)
  else n * factorial (n-1)

(* Calculate the factorial of 5 and print the result *)
let fact_of_5 = factorial 5
print_int fact_of_5

(* Output: 120 *)
