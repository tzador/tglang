(** A function that calculates the factorial of a given number n *)

(* Defining the function *)
let rec factorial n =
  if n <= 1 then 1  (* Base case: factorial of 1 is 1 *)
  else n * factorial (n-1)  (* Recursive case: multiply n with factorial of n-1 *)

(* Testing the function *)
let () = 
  (* Printing the factorial of 5 *)
  print_int (factorial 5);;

(* Output: 120 *)
