(* This code implements a function that checks if a given number is a perfect square *)

let is_perfect_square n =
    let rec aux m =
        if m * m = n then true  (* Base case: if m squared is equal to n, return true *)
        else if m * m < n then aux (m + 1)  (* Recursive case: if m squared is less than n, increment m and call function again *)
        else false  (* If m squared is greater than n, return false *)
    in
    aux 1  (* Starting with m = 1 *)

(* Result: is_perfect_square 25 returns true, is_perfect_square 26 returns false *)
