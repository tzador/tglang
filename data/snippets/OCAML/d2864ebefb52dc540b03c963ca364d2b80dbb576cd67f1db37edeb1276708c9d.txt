let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1
  | 1 -> 1
  | x -> x * factorial (x-1)
          
(* This function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion *)
(* The base cases are when n is 0 or 1, which both return 1 as the factorial *)
(* For any other number, it multiplies that number with the factorial of (n-1) *)
(* Returns the factorial of the given number *)
