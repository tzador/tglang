(* Simple recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given integer *)
let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1 (* base case: factorial of 0 is 1 *)
  | _ -> n * factorial (n-1) (* recursive call to calculate factorial of n-1 *)

(* Output the factorial of 5 *)
let result = factorial 5

(* Output the result *)
Printf.printf "Factorial of 5 is %d\n" result
