type binary_tree =
  | Leaf of int
  | Node of binary_tree * binary_tree

(* The `binary_tree` type represents a binary tree where each node
 * either has two child nodes, represented by the `Node` constructor,
 * or is a leaf node with no children, represented by the `Leaf` constructor.
 * The `Leaf` constructor takes in an `int` value as its parameter. 
 * The `Node` constructor takes in two `binary_tree` values as parameters. *)
