(* This function takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list. *)

let rec sum_even lst = 
  match lst with 
  | [] -> 0 
  | x::xs -> if x mod 2 = 0 then x + sum_even xs else sum_even xs;; 

(* Example usage *) 

let lst = [1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9] 
let result = sum_even lst (* result is 20 *)
