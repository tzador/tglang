(* This function takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list *)
let rec even_sum = function
  | [] -> 0
  | x::xs -> if x mod 2 = 0 then x + even_sum xs else even_sum xs

(* Example usage *)
let numbers = [1;2;3;4;5;6] (* Define a list of numbers *)
let result = even_sum numbers (* Call the function with the list as input *)
(* Output: 12, as 2+4+6 = 12 *)
