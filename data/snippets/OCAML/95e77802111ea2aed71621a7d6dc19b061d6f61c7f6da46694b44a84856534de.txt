  The following code snippet implements a function for computing 
  the sum of the first n numbers in a list. 
  The function makes use of recursion. 
  @param n number of elements to sum 
  @param lst list of elements 
  @return sum of first n numbers in lst

  match lst with  
  | [] -> 0  
  | hd :: tl -> if n = 0 then 0 else hd + sum_of_n (n-1) tl
