(* This is a function that takes in two integers and returns the sum of their squares *)

let square_sum x y =
    let x_sq = x * x in (* square first integer *)
    let y_sq = y * y in (* square second integer *)
    let sum = x_sq + y_sq in (* calculate sum of squares *)
    sum;; (* return sum *)

(* Example call *)
square_sum 3 4;; (* output: 25 *)
