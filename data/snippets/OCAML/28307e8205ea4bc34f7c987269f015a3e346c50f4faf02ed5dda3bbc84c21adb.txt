(* A function that checks if a given list of integers has a pair whose sum is divisible by a given number *)
let check_for_sum lst num = 
  let rec helper lst diff = 
    match lst with
    | [] -> false
    | h::t -> if List.mem (diff-h) t then true else helper t diff in
  helper lst (num/2)

(* Example usage *)
let lst = [3; 5; 8; 10; 12; 15]
let num = 6
let result = check_for_sum lst num (* result = true *) 
let lst2 = [2; 4; 6; 8; 10]
let num2 = 7
let result2 = check_for_sum lst2 num2 (* result2 = false *)
