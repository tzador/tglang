(* This is a function that takes in two integers, a and b, and returns the sum of their squares *)
let square_sum a b = 
    let a_squared = a * a in (* first integer squared *)
    let b_squared = b * b in (* second integer squared *)
    let sum = a_squared + b_squared in (* sum of the squared integers *)
    sum (* return the final sum *)
