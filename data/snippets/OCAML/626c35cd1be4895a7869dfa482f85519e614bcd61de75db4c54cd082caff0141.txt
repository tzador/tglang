(*This code snippet is a recursive function to compute the factorial of a given number*)
let rec factorial n = 
  match n with 
  | 0 -> 1 (*Return 1 if n is 0*)
  | x -> x * factorial(x-1) (*Multiply the number itself with factorial of (x-1)*)
  
let result = factorial 5 (*Input the number whose factorial needs to be computed*)
  
Printf.printf "The factorial of %d is %d" 5 result (*Print the result*)
