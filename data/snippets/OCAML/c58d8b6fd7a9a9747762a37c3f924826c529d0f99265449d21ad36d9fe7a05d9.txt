(* A recursive function to calculate factorial *)
let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1 (* base case *)
  | _ -> n * factorial (n - 1) (* recursive case, calling the function again with n-1 *)

(* Main function *)
let main =
  let num = 5 in (* set input value *)
  let result = factorial num in (* call factorial function with input value *)
  print_string "The factorial of "; print_int num; print_string " is "; print_int result (* print output message with calculated factorial *)
