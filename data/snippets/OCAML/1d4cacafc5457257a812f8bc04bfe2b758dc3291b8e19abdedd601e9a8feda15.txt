(* This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the average *)
let average list =
  let sum = List.fold_left (+) 0 list in (* First, we use List.fold_left to sum up all the integers in the list *)
  let length = List.length list in (* Then we use List.length to get the length of the list *)
  sum / length;; (* Finally, we divide the sum by the length to get the average *)
