(* This is an example of a function that uses pattern matching to handle different inputs and produces an output based on those inputs. *)

let rec count_letters = function
  | [] -> 0                            (* If the list is empty, return 0 *)
  | x :: xs -> String.length x + count_letters xs        (* If the list is not empty, add the length of the first element to the recursive call on the rest of the list *)

(* Example usage: *)
let letters = ["a"; "b"; "c"]
let result = count_letters letters   (* Output: 3 *)
