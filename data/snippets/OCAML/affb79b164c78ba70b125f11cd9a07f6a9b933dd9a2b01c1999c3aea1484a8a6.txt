(*This is a function that finds the maximum element of a list*)

let rec max_element lst =
  match lst with
  | [] -> failwith "empty list" (*if list is empty, raise an error*)
  | [x] -> x (*if list contains one element, return it*)
  | x::xs -> (*if list contains more than one element*)
      let max_rest = max_element xs in (*find max element in remaining list*)
      if x > max_rest then x else max_rest;; (*compare current element with max of remaining list*)

(*Example usage*)
let lst = [2; 5; 1; 3; 8; 4];; (*create a list*)
let max = max_element lst;; (*find the maximum element*)
Printf.printf "The maximum element is: %d" max;; (*print the result*)
