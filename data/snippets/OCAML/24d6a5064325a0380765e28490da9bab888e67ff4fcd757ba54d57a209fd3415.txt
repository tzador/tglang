(* This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number. *)

let rec factorial n =
  if n = 0 then 1
  else n * factorial (n-1)

;;

(* Test Cases: *)

print_int (factorial 3);; (* Output: 6 *)

print_int (factorial 5);; (* Output: 120 *)

print_int (factorial 0);; (* Output: 1 *)

(* Explanation: *)

(* The factorial function takes in a number and recursively calculates its factorial by checking if the number is 0. If it is 0, then the function returns 1, otherwise it multiplies the number by its factorial of n-1. *)
