(** Initialize a list of integers *)
let lst = [1;2;3;4;5] 

(** Define a function to get the last element of a list *)
let rec last lst = 
  match lst with
  | [] -> failwith "Empty list"
  | [x] -> x
  | _ :: xs -> last xs

(** Call the function and print the last element *)
print_endline (string_of_int (last lst))

(** Output: 5 *)
