(* This code snippet is a function that finds the maximum element in a list *)

(* Function to recursively check elements of the list and find the maximum *)
let rec max_in_list lst =
  match lst with
  | [] -> failwith "Empty list"
  | [x] -> x
  | hd :: tl ->
      let max_rest = max_in_list tl in
      if hd > max_rest then hd else max_rest

(* Example input list *)
let lst = [5; 10; 3; 8; 2; 9]

(* Call function and print result *)
let result = max_in_list lst
print_endline ("The maximum element is: " ^ string_of_int result)

(* Output: The maximum element is: 10 *)
