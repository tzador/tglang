(* This is a function that computes the n-th Fibonacci number. It takes in one argument: n, the index of the Fibonacci number to compute. *)
let rec fibonacci n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1 (* base case, the 0th Fibonacci number is 1 *)
  | 1 -> 1 (* base case, the 1st Fibonacci number is 1 *)
  | n -> fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2) (* recursive case, compute the sum of the (n-1)th Fibonacci number and the (n-2)th Fibonacci number *)

(* Example usage of the fibonacci function: *)
let result = fibonacci 6 (* computes the 6th Fibonacci number, which should be 8 *)
