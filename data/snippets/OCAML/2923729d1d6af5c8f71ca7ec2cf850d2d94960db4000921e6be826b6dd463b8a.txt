(* This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number *)
(* Input: n - the number to calculate the factorial of *)
(* Output: the factorial of n *)
let rec factorial n = 
    if n = 0 then 
        1 
    else 
        n * factorial (n - 1)
        
(* Example call: *)
let result = factorial 5        (* result will have the value of 120 *)
