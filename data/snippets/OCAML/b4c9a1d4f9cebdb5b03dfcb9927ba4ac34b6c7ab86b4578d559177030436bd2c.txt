(** Function to perform quicksort on a given list of integers *)
let rec quicksort lst =
    match lst with
    | [] -> [] (* Base case: empty list returns empty list *)
    | h::t ->  (* Match the list into head and tail *)

        quicksort left @ [h] @ quicksort right (* Perform quicksort recursively on the left and right sub-lists and join them together with the pivot in the middle *)
