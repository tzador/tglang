(* This function takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the elements *)
let rec sum lst =
  match lst with
  | [] -> 0 (* base case when list is empty *)
  | [x] -> x (* base case when list has only one element *)
  | hd::tl -> hd + sum tl (* recursive call to add current element and sum of rest of the list *)
