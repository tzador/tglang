(* Defining a recursive function to find the factorial of a number *)
let rec factorial num =
  if num < 2 then 1 (* Base case, factorial of 0 and 1 is 1 *)
  else num * factorial (num - 1) (* Recursive call, factorial is num times factorial of num-1 *)

factorial 5 (* Calling the function with input of 5 *)
(* Output: 120, which is the factorial of 5 (5*4*3*2*1) *)
