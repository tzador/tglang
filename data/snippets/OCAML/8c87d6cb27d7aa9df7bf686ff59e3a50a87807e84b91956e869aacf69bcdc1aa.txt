(* This code snippet is a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number *)

let rec factorial n =     (* 'rec' keyword denotes a recursive function *)
  if n = 0 then 1         (* base case - factorial of 0 is 1 *)
  else n * factorial (n - 1)  (* recursive call to factorial function with n-1 *)

(* Sample input and output *)
- factorial 4;;          (* input: factorial of 4 *)
- output: 24;;            (* output: factorial of 4 is 24 *)
