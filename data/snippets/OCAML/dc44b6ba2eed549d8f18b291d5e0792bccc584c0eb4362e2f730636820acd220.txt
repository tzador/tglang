(* This is a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number recursively *)

let rec fibonacci n =
    (* Base case when n = 0 or n = 1 *)
    if n = 0 || n = 1 then
        1
    (* Recursive calls for n > 1 *)
    else
        fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2)  (* This line calculates the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers *)

(* Example usage of the function *)
let result = fibonacci 6 (* result = 13, since the 6th Fibonacci number is 13 *)
