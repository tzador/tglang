(* This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns a new list with only the even numbers *)

let rec filter_even (lst : int list) : int list =
  match lst with
  | [] -> []  (* If the list is empty, return an empty list *)
  | h :: t ->  (* h is the head of the list, t is the tail *)
      if h mod 2 = 0 then h :: filter_even t (* If h is even, add it to the new list *)
      else filter_even t (* If h is odd, skip it and continue to the next element *)

(* Example usage of the function *)
let lst = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] (* Defining a list of integers *)
let even_lst = filter_even lst (* Using the function to get a new list with only even numbers *)

(* Output: [2; 4] *)
