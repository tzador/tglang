(* This program calculates the square of a number using recursion *)
let rec square n =      (* Define 'square' as a recursive function with argument n *)
  if n = 0 then 0       (* Base case - if n is 0, return 0 *)
  else n * n            (* Otherwise, multiply n with itself *)
  
let result = square 8   (* Call the 'square' function with argument 8 and assign it to result *)
in                      (* 'in' keyword is used to indicate the end of function definition *)
print_endline (string_of_int result) (* Convert the result to a string and print it *)
(* Output: The square of 8 is 64 *)  (* The commented line is the expected output of the program *)
