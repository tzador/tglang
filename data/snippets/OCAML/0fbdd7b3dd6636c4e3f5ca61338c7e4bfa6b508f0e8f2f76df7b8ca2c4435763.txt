let rec factorial n = if n = 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n-1);;

(* Explanation: This code snippet defines a function named "factorial" in OCAML using the "let" keyword. The function takes in a parameter named "n" and performs a recursive operation to calculate the factorial of n. In the function body, the if-else statement checks if n is equal to 0, and if so, returns 1. Otherwise, it multiplies n with the result of the factorial function called with the parameter n-1. The ";;" at the end of the line indicates the end of the function definition.  *)
