(* Function to calculate the factorial of a number *)
let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1                  (* Base case: factorial of 0 is 1 *)
  | _ -> n * factorial(n-1)  (* Recursive case: n times factorial of n-1 *)

(* Example usage: calculating the factorial of 5 (5! = 120) *)
let result = factorial 5

(* Output: 120 *)
