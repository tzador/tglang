    This is a function that takes in a list of integers
    and returns a list of the same integers in reverse order.

    @param lst : int list - the list of integers to be reversed
    @return reversed : int list - the list of integers in reverse order

let rec reverse_list (lst : int list) : int list =
  match lst with
  | [] -> []
  | hd :: tl -> (reverse_list tl) @ [hd]
