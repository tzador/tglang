(* Define a recursive function that returns the factorial of a given integer *)
let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1 (* Base case: factorial of 0 is 1 *)
  | _ -> n * factorial (n - 1) (* Recursive case: multiply n with factorial of n-1 *)

(* Call the factorial function with input 5 and print the result *)
print_int (factorial 5) (* Output: 120 *)
