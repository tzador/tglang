(* This is a function that takes in an integer, n, and returns the
   sum of all numbers from 1 to n *)

let rec sum n =
  if n = 1 then 1 (* Base case: if n = 1, return 1 *)
  else n + sum(n-1) (* Recursive case: add n to the sum of all numbers from 1 to n-1 *)

(* Example usage:
sum 5;; (* Outputs 15 *) *)
