(* This code snippet demonstrates a recursive function in OCAML *)
let rec factorial x =
  if x == 0 then 1                 (* Base case *)
  else x * factorial (x-1)         (* Recursive call *)

let result = factorial 5           (* Calling the function *)
Printf.printf "The factorial of 5 is %d" result  (* Printing the result *)
(* Output: The factorial of 5 is 120 *)
