(* Define a function that takes in a list of integers and returns their sum *)
let rec sum lst =
  match lst with
  | [] -> 0 (* Base case: empty list has sum of 0 *)
  | x::xs -> x + sum xs (* Recursive case: add the first element to the sum of the rest of the list *)

(* Test the function *)
let lst = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] (* Define a list of integers *)
let result = sum lst (* Call the sum function *)
print_int result (* Print the result to the console *)
