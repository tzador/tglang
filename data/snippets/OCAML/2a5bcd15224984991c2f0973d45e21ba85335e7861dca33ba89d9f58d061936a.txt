(* Define a recursive function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all elements *)
let rec sum_list lst =
  match lst with
  | [] -> 0 (* Base case: return 0 if list is empty *)
  | [x] -> x (* Base case: return the single element if list has only one element *)
  | x :: xs -> x + sum_list xs (* Recursive case: add the first element to the sum of the rest of the list *)

(* Example usage *)
let my_list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
let result = sum_list my_list (* result = 15 *)
