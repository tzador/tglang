(* This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the numbers *)
let sum_ints (nums : int list) : int =

  (* internal function that recursively adds all the numbers in the list *)
  let rec sum_helper acc nums =
    match nums with
    | [] -> acc
    | hd::tl -> sum_helper (acc + hd) tl
    
  (* call the internal function with starting value of 0 *)
  sum_helper 0 nums
  
(* Example usage of the function *)
let nums = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
let sum = sum_ints nums
Printf.printf "The sum of all numbers in list %A is %d\n" nums sum

(* Output: `The sum of all numbers in list [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] is 15` *)
