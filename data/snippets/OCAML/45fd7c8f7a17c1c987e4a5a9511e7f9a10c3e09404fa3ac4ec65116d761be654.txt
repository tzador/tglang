(* A recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number *)
let rec factorial n =
    if n = 0 then 1      (* base case: factorial of 0 is 1 *)
    else n * factorial(n - 1) (* recursive call to calculate factorial of n-1 *)

(* An example call with input 5 *)
let result = factorial 5

(* Output: result = 120 *)
