(*This function sorts a list in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm*)
let rec bubble_sort lst =
  match lst with
  | [] -> []
  | [x] -> [x]
  | x :: xs ->
      let sorted_xs = bubble_sort xs in
      if x <= List.hd sorted_xs then
        x :: sorted_xs
      else
        List.hd sorted_xs :: bubble_sort (x :: List.tl sorted_xs)

(*Example usage*)
let sorted_list = bubble_sort [9; 5; 2; 7; 4; 1; 8; 6; 3]
(*Output: [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9]*)
