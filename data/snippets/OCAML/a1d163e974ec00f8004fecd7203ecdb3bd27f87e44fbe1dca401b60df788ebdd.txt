(* This is a function that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a list *)
let rec sum_even lst = 
    match lst with 
    | [] -> 0 (* if the list is empty, return 0 *)
    | hd::tl -> 
        if hd mod 2 = 0 then hd + sum_even tl (* if the head is even, add it to the sum of remaining list elements *)
        else sum_even tl (* if the head is odd, skip it and find the sum of remaining list elements *)

(* Example usage *)
let my_list = [1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10] (* initialize a list of numbers *)
let result = sum_even my_list (* call the function to find the sum of even numbers in the list *)
(* Print the result *)
print_int result (* output: 30, as 2+4+6+8+10 = 30 *)
