(*Define a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number*)
let rec factorial n =
  if n = 0 then 1 (*Base case: 0 factorial is 1*)
  else n * factorial (n-1) (*Recursive case: multiply n with factorial of n-1*)

(*Call the factorial function with input 5 and store the result in a variable*)
let factorial_of_5 = factorial 5

(*Print the result*)
print_string "Factorial of 5 is: ";
print_int factorial_of_5;

(*Output: "Factorial of 5 is: 120"*)
