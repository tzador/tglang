(* A function that takes in two lists and checks if there are any common elements between them *)

(** Common elements is a list that contains the common elements between the two input lists
    @param lst1 : first input list
    @param lst2 : second input list
    @return common_elem : list of common elements between lst1 and lst2 *)
let rec find_common_elements lst1 lst2 = 
    match lst1 with 
    | [] -> []
    | hd::tl ->
        if List.mem hd lst2 then 
            hd::(find_common_elements tl lst2)
        else 
            find_common_elements tl lst2

(* Example usage *)

find_common_elements [1;2;3] [2;3;4] ;;
(* Output: [2;3] *)
