(* This code snippet is a function that takes in a list of integers 
and returns a new list with the even numbers squared. *)

let rec square_even nums =
  match nums with
  | [] -> []
  | x::xs ->
      if (x mod 2 = 0) (* checks if number is even *)
      then (x * x)::(square_even xs) (* squares even number and adds to new list *)
      else square_even xs (* skips odd numbers and continues recursion *)
      
(* Example usage:
 * let result = square_even [1; 2; 3; 4] (* result is [4; 16] *)
 *)
