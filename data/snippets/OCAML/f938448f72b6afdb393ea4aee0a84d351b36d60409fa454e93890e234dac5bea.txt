(* Function to calculate the factorial of a given number *)

(* Function to recursively calculate the factorial,
   taking in a number and a running total *)
let rec factorial num total =
  match num with
  | 0 -> total
  | _ -> factorial (num-1) (total*num)

(* Function to check if a number is positive or negative *)
let isPositive x =
  match x with
  | x when x>0 -> true
  | _ -> false

(* Function to calculate the absolute value of a number *)
let abs x =
  match isPositive x with
  | true -> x
  | _ -> -x

(* Function to calculate the factorial of an absolute number *)
let absFactorial num =
  let absolute = abs num in
  factorial absolute 1;;

(* Example usage *)
let result = absFactorial (-5);;
(* result = 120 *)
