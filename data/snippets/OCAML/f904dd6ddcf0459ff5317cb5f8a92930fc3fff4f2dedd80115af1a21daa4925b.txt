(* This is a simple function that takes in a list of integers and returns the same list with all even numbers removed *)

let rec filter_even nums =
  match nums with
  | [] -> []
  | head :: tail -> if head mod 2 = 0 then filter_even tail else head :: filter_even tail
  (* if the head of the list is even, recurisvely call the function on the tail, otherwise add it to the new list *)
  
(* Example usage *)
filter_even [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] (* Output: [1; 3; 5] *)
