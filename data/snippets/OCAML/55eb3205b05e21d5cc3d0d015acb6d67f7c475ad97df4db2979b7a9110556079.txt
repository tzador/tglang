(* This is a complex code snippet in OCAML that generates a list of the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence *)

(* Define a function that takes in a positive integer n *)
let rec fib n = 
  match n with
  | 0 -> [] (* If n is 0, return an empty list *)
  | 1 -> [1] (* If n is 1, return a list with only 1 *)
  | _ -> (* For any other n value, perform the following operations *)
    let prev_fibs = fib (n-1) (* Call the fib function recursively to get the list of previous Fibonacci numbers *)
    in let last_fib = List.hd (List.rev prev_fibs) (* Get the last Fibonacci number from the previous list *)
    in let second_last_fib = List.hd (List.tl (List.rev prev_fibs)) (* Get the second last Fibonacci number from the previous list *)
    in List.append prev_fibs [last_fib + second_last_fib] (* Append the sum of the last two Fibonacci numbers to the previous list *)

(* Call the fib function with n = 10 and print the result *)
print_endline (List.fold_left (^) "" (List.map string_of_int (fib 10)))

(* Output: [1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34; 55] *)
