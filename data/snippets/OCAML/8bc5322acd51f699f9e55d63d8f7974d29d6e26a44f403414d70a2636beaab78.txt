(** Function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number in OCAML *)
let rec fibonacci n =
    if n < 2 then n
    else fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)
    (* Recursive function that calls itself until the base cases are reached *)
    
(* Test cases to ensure proper functionality *)
let fib1 = fibonacci 0
let fib2 = fibonacci 1
let fib3 = fibonacci 5
let fib4 = fibonacci 10

(* Printing the results *)
Printf.printf "The 0th Fibonacci number is %d \n" fib1;
Printf.printf "The 1st Fibonacci number is %d \n" fib2;
Printf.printf "The 5th Fibonacci number is %d \n" fib3;
Printf.printf "The 10th Fibonacci number is %d \n" fib4;

(* Output:
The 0th Fibonacci number is 0
The 1st Fibonacci number is 1
The 5th Fibonacci number is 5
The 10th Fibonacci number is 55
