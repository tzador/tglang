(* Create a recursive function that takes in a number and returns the factorial of that number *)
let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1 (* Base case: return 1 if n is 0 *)
  | _ -> n * factorial (n-1) (* Recursive case: multiply n by the factorial of n-1 *)
  
(* Call the function with input 5 and print the result *)
print_int (factorial 5);; (* Output: 120 *)
