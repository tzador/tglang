(** This function returns the inner product of two vectors by taking the sum of the products of corresponding elements *)
let inner_product vector1 vector2 = 
    let rec helper vec1 vec2 acc = 
        match vec1, vec2 with
        | [], [] -> acc
        | x::xs, y::ys -> helper xs ys (acc + (x * y))

(* Example usage *)
let result = inner_product [1;2;3] [4;5;6];;

(* Output: 
val inner_product : int list -> int list -> int = <fun>
val result : int = 32
