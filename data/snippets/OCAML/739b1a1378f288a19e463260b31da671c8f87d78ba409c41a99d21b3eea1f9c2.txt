(* This is a recursive function in OCAML that calculates the factorial of a given number *)

let rec factorial n =   (* defining the function *)
  if n = 0 then 1       (* base case, factorial of 0 is 1 *)
  else n * factorial (n-1)  (* factorial formula, recursive call *)

(* Calling the function with a given input *)
let result = factorial 5   (* result is equal to 5! which is 120 *)

(* Printing the result *)
print_string("The result is " ^ string_of_int(result))  (* output: "The result is 120" *)
