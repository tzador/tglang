(* A custom module
 * This module defines a type representing a student's grade
 * and functions for calculating average grade and determining 
 * if a student is passing or failing. 
*)

  type grade = float

  (* Function to calculate the average grade of a list of grades *)
  let rec average_grade grades =
    match grades with
    | [] -> 0.0 (* if list is empty, average grade is 0 *)
    | x::xs -> x +. average_grade xs (* recursively sum grades and divide by total number *)

  (* Function to determine if a student is passing or failing *)

(* Example usage of the StudentGrade module *)
