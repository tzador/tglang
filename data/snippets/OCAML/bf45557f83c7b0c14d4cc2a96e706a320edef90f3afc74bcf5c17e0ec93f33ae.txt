(* This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list *)

(* Helper function to check if a number is even*)
let check_even num = num mod 2 = 0

(* Function to recursively iterate through the list and add even numbers to the sum *)
let rec sum_even = function
  | [] -> 0 (* Base case: if list is empty, sum is 0 *)
  | x::xs -> if check_even x then x + sum_even xs (* If current number is even, add it to sum and call function with remaining list *)
             else sum_even xs (* If current number is odd, skip it and call function with remaining list *)
			 
(* Example usage of the function *)
let num_list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]
let result = sum_even num_list
print_string "The sum of even numbers in the list is: " (int_to_string result)
