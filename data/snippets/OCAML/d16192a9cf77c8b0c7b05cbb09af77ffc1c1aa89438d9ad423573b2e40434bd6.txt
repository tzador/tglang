(* A function that takes in a list of integers and returns a new list with each element multiplied by 2 *)
let rec multiply_list list = match list with
    | [] -> [] (* If empty list, return empty list *)
    | x :: xs -> (2 * x) :: (multiply_list xs) (* Multiply first element by 2 and then recursively call function on rest of list *)

(* Example usage *)
let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] (* Create a list of numbers *)
let doubled_numbers = multiply_list numbers (* Call function to double each number in list *)
(* Output: [2; 4; 6; 8; 10] *)
