(** This is a complex implementation of a function that calculates the nth power of a number.
    @param x The base number
    @param n The power to raise the base number to
    @return The nth power of the base number
*)
let nth_power x n = 
  let rec power acc x n = 
    if n = 0 then acc
    else power (acc * x) x (n-1)
  in
  power 1 x n

(* Example usage *)
let result = nth_power 2 5  (* this will calculate 2 to the 5th power and assign the result to the 'result' variable *)
