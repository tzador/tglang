(* This is a function that takes in two integer values and returns the greatest common divisor using Euclid's algorithm *)

let rec gcd a b =
  if b = 0 then a else gcd b (a mod b) ;;

(* Recursively finds the greatest common divisor by continuously dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is 0. *)

Printf.printf "The greatest common divisor of %d and %d is %d" 14 21 (gcd 14 21) ;;
(* Output: The greatest common divisor of 14 and 21 is 7 *)
