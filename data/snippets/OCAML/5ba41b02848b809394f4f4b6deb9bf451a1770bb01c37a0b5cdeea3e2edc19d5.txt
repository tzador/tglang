(* This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list *)

let rec sum_even (l: int list) : int = 
  match l with
  | [] -> 0 (* Base case: if list is empty, sum is 0 *)
  | h::t -> if h mod 2 = 0 then h + sum_even t else sum_even t (* If head of list (h) is even, add h to the sum of remaining elements (t). Otherwise, just add the sum of remaining elements *)

(* Example usage:
* sum_even [1;2;3;4;5] = 6 (2 + 4)
* sum_even [10;11;12] = 22 (10 + 12) *)

(* End of function *)
