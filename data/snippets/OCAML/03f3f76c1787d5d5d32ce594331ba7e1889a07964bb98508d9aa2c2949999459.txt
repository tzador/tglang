(* Create a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list *)
let rec sum_even lst =
  match lst with
  | [] -> 0
  | hd::tl -> if hd mod 2 = 0 then hd + sum_even tl else sum_even tl

(* Test the function with a sample list *)
let sample_list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
let result = sum_even sample_list

(* Print the result *)
print_endline ("Sum of even numbers in the list: " ^ string_of_int result)

(* Output: Sum of even numbers in the list: 12 *)
