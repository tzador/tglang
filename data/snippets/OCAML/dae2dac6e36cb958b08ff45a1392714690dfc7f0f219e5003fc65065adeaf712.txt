  (* A recursive function to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. 
  Takes in a parameter n, an integer representing which number in the sequence to calculate. 
  Uses pattern matching and recursion to calculate the next number in the sequence. 
  Base case is when n is less than 2, which returns n. 
  Otherwise, calls the function again with the 2 previous numbers in the sequence, and adds them together. 
  Terminates when n reaches 0 or 1, as those are the first 2 numbers in the sequence. *)
