;;; This is a code snippet written in HACK
;;; It is a programming language created for the book "The Cuckoo's Egg"
;;; by Cliff Stoll to be used by hackers in the book's universe

;;; Declare variables
DECL x
DECL y

;;; Initialize variables
SET x TO 5
SET y TO 9

;;; Calculate sum
SET sum TO x + y

;;; Print result
OUT sum ;;; Output should be 14

;;; Loop through range
SET i TO 0
SET result TO 1
WHILE i LESS THAN sum DO
    SET result TO result TIMES (i + 1)
    SET i TO i + 1
END WHILE

;;; Print factorial of sum
OUT result ;;; Output should be 87178291200

;;; Generate random number
SET rand TO RND

;;; Check if rand is even or odd
IF rand MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
    OUT "Even" ;;; Output should be "Even"
ELSE
    OUT "Odd" ;;; Output should be "Odd"
END IF

;;; Define recursive function
DEF fib(n) DO
    IF n EQUALS 0 OR n EQUALS 1 THEN
        RETURN n
    ELSE
        RETURN fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    END IF
END DEF

;;; Print Fibonacci sequence
SET num TO 10
WHILE num GREATER THAN 0 DO
    OUT fib(num)
    SET num TO num - 1
END WHILE
;;;;/ Output should be 55 34 21 13 8 5 3 2 1 1
