; This is a code snippet in HACK, a programming language developed at Facebook for their HHVM virtual machine.

; The following code uses a recursive algorithm to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.

; Function definition for calculating the n-th Fibonacci number.
(define (fib n) 
  ; Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return n.
  (if (or (= n 0) (= n 1)) 
      n
      ; Recursive case: calculate the n-th Fibonacci number by recursively calling the function for n-1 and n-2.
      (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))

; Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
; Note: the `(begin ...)` form allows for multiple expressions to be evaluated in sequence.
(begin 
  (display "The first 10 Fibonacci numbers are: ") ; Print a message to the console.
  ; Loop through the numbers 0 to 9 and call the `fib` function for each one, displaying the result.
  (do ((i 0 (+ i 1))) ((>= i 10)) 
      ; Print the current Fibonacci number on a new line.
      (display (format "~A~%" (fib i)))))
