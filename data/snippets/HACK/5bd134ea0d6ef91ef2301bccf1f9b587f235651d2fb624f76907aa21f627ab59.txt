# This is a simple program written in the HACK programming language
# It takes in two numbers and calculates their sum

// Initializing two variables with values 10 and 5
A = 10
B = 5

// Reversing the order of the variables
B = B + A
A = B - A
B = B - A

// Printing out the values of the variables
OUT A // Output: 5
OUT B // Output: 10

// Initializing a new variable that will hold the sum of A and B
SUM = A + B

// Printing out the sum
OUT SUM // Output: 15
