// This is a code snippet in HACK, a programming language specifically designed for digital security and cyber attacks.

// First, we import the necessary libraries for our code.
import security.h
import hacking.toolkit

// Next, we define a function for our attack, which takes in the target IP address as a parameter.
function attack(targetIP) {

  // We create a socket connection using the 'hacker' class from the security library.
  hacker socket = security.h.socket(targetIP)

  // We set the socket's timeout to 10 seconds to prevent long delays in the attack.
  socket.timeout = 10

  // Now, we define a list of potential login credentials to use for our attack.
  credentials = [ "admin:password123", "root:qwerty", "genericuser:pass" ]

  // We use a 'for' loop to iterate through each credential in the list.
  for credential in credentials {

    // We split the credential into a username and password using the colon as a delimiter.
    username, password = credential.split(":")

    // We use the 'try' and 'except' statements to handle any potential errors in our attack.
    try {

      // We attempt to login using the current credential.
      socket.login(username, password)

      // If successful, we print a message to the user and break out of the loop.
      print("Login successful with credentials " + username + ":" + password)
      break;

    } except {

      // If login fails, we continue to the next credential in the list.
      continue;
    }
  }

  // Finally, we close the socket connection.
  socket.close()
}

// We call our 'attack' function with the IP address of our target.
attack("192.168.1.1")
