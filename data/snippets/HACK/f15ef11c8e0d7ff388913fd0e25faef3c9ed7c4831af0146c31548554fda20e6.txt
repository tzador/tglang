### This is a code snippet for generating a random password

def generate_password(length):
    import string
    import random

    # Setting the possible characters to be used in the password
    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation

    # Initializing an empty string to store the password
    password = ''

    # Looping through the length specified to generate random characters until the desired length is reached
    for i in range(length):
        password += random.choice(chars)

    # Outputting the generated password
    print("Your random password is: " + password)

# Taking user input for the desired length of the password
length = int(input("Enter the length of the password: "))

# Calling the generate_password function with the inputted length as the parameter
generate_password(length)

# Sample output:
# Enter the length of the password: 10
# Your random password is: 6t8;Sm+u2$
