# This code snippet is a function in the HACK programming language that checks if a given number is prime
# Input: An integer
# Output: Boolean value indicating whether the input is prime or not
func isPrime(n){
    var prime = true;   # variable to store the result of the primality check
    var i = 2;          # counter for the loop to check factors of the input number
    while(i < n){       # loop to check all possible factors
        if(n % i == 0){ # if i is a factor of n, then it is not a prime number
            prime = false;
            break;      # exit the loop since the number is not prime
        }
        i++;            # increment the counter
    }
    return prime;       # return the final result
