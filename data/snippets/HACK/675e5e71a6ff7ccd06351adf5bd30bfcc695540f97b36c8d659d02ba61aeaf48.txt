# HACK program to calculate the factorial of a number

# Initialize a variable to store the input number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Set the initial value of the factorial
factorial = 1

# Check if the input number is negative
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial cannot be calculated for negative numbers!")
elif num == 0:
    # Factorial of 0 is always 1
    print("Factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
    # Loop through the numbers from 1 to the input number
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        # Multiply each number with the factorial
        factorial = factorial * i
    # Print the result
    print("Factorial of", num, "is", factorial)
