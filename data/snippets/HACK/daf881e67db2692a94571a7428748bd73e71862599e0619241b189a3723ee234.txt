# This is a comment in HACK language to explain the purpose of the following code.
# The code below creates a function that checks if a number is prime.

###function isPrime(num)      # This line starts the function definition, takes in a parameter 'num'.
###    if num <= 1            # This line checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, which is not prime.
###        return false      # If true, then the number is not prime so return false.
###    else
###        for i in range(2, num):    # This line iterates over all numbers from 2 to (num - 1).
###            if num % i == 0         # This line checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and (num - 1).
###                return false        # If true, then the number is not prime so return false.
###        return true                 # If none of the numbers were divisible, then the number is prime so return true.

###num = int(input("Enter a number: "))     # This line takes in user input and converts it to an integer.
###result = isPrime(num)                    # This line calls the isPrime function with the user input as the argument.
###if result:                               # This line checks if the result from the function is true.
###    print(str(num) + " is a prime number.")    # If true, print out that the number is prime.
###else:
###    print(str(num) + " is not a prime number.") # If false, print out that the number is not prime.
