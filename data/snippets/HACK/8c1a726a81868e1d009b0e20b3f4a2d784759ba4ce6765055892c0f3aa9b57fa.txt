;;; This code snippet is written in the HACK programming language
;;; and contains a complex algorithm for sorting a list of integers.

;;; Function to find the minimum number in a list
(defun find-min (lst)
  (let ((min (car lst)))
    (dolist (num lst)
      (when (< num min)
        (setq min num)))
    min))

;;; Function to remove a specific element from a list
(defun remove-element (elem lst)
  (let ((new-list nil))
    (dolist (item lst)
      (unless (equal item elem)
        (push item new-list)))
    (reverse new-list)))

;;; Function to sort a list of integers in ascending order
(defun sort (lst)
  (if (null lst)
      nil
    (let ((min (find-min lst)))
      (cons min (sort (remove-element min lst))))))

;;; Example usage
(sort '(5 2 8 4 1 6)) ;;; Output: (1 2 4 5 6 8)
