// First, we declare and initialize some variables
mem[0] = 5
mem[1] = 10
mem[2] = 0

// Next, we create a loop that will run 10 times
i = 0
loop:
  if i < 10 {
    // In each iteration, we add the value of mem[0] to mem[2]
    mem[2] = mem[2] + mem[0]
    // We also increment the value of mem[1] by 1
    mem[1] = mem[1] + 1
    // Finally, we store the value of mem[1] in mem[0] for the next iteration
    mem[0] = mem[1]
    // We then jump back to the beginning of the loop
    jmp loop
  }
// After the loop finishes, we print out the final value of mem[2]
// This will be equal to 5 * 10 = 50, since the loop ran 10 times and added 5 to mem[2] each time
print mem[2]
// The output of this code snippet will be:
// 50
