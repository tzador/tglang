; This program generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit

; Define variables for the first two numbers in the sequence
; `a` represents the first number and `b` represents the second number
;a=0
;b=1

; Prompt user for the limit of the sequence
print("Enter the limit of the sequence:")
limit = input()

; Convert limit to integer for calculation purposes
limit = int(limit)

; Define a list to store the sequence numbers
; Add the first two numbers to the list
sequence = [a, b]

; Define a loop to generate the remaining numbers
; Loop starts from i=2 since first two numbers are already added to the list
for i in range(2, limit):
    ; Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the last two numbers
    next_num = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]
    ; Add the next number to the list
    sequence.append(next_num)

; Print the sequence
print("Fibonacci sequence up to " + str(limit) + ":")
print(sequence)
