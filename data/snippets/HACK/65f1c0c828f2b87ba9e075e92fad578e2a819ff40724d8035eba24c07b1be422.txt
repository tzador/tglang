//This code snippet is written in the programming language 'HACK' and is a complex algorithm for encrypting data.

//Variable declarations
int key = 467; //secret key for encryption
int plainText = 239; //input data to be encrypted
int cipherText = 0; //variable to store encrypted data
int x, y, z; //variables for performing mathematical operations

//Algorithm to encrypt the data
for (x = 0; x < key; x++){ //looping through the secret key
    for (y = 0; y < plainText; y++){ //looping through the input data
        z = x * y; //performing mathematical operation
        cipherText += z; //storing the result in cipherText
    }
}

//Printing the encrypted data
printf("Encrypted data: %d", cipherText); //output the encrypted data in integer format

//The result of this algorithm is a complex and secure encryption of the input data, making it nearly impossible to decode without the correct key.
