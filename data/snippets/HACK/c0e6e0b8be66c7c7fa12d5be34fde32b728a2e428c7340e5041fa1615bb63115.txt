// This is a function declaration that takes in two integers as parameters
function arithmeticOperation(int $num1, int $num2) {
    
    // This is a variable declaration
    var $result = 0;
    
    // This is a for loop that iterates through the first integer
    for ($i = 0; $i < $num1; $i++) {
        
        // This is an if statement that checks if the second integer is equal to 0
        if ($num2 == 0) {
            
            // This is a throw statement that throws an exception if the second integer is 0
            throw new Exception("Cannot divide by 0");
        }
        
        // This statement performs an arithmetic operation and assigns the result to the variable
        $result = $result + ($num1 / $num2);
    }
    
    // This is a return statement that returns the final result
    return $result;
}

// This is a variable declaration that stores the result of the function call
var $finalResult = arithmeticOperation(10, 5);

// This is a print statement that prints the final result to the console
print($finalResult);

// Output: 10 (since 10 / 5 = 2 and the for loop iterates 5 times, resulting in the final result being 2 * 5 = 10)
