##### DECRYPTION ALGORITHM FOR ENCRYPTED MESSAGE #####
# Initialize encryption key and string to store decrypted message
key = "H4ck3rm4n"
decrypted_message = ""

# Get encrypted message from user
encrypted_message = input("Enter encrypted message: ")

# Loop through each character in the encrypted message
for char in encrypted_message:
    # Convert character to its ASCII code
    ascii_code = ord(char)
    # Subtract the ASCII code of the encryption key character from the ASCII code of the encrypted message character
    decrypted_ascii_code = ascii_code - ord(key[0])
    # Add the ASCII code of the encryption key character to the ASCII code of the decrypted message character
    decrypted_ascii_code += ord(key[1])
    # Convert the decrypted ASCII code back to its character form and append it to the decrypted message string
    decrypted_message += chr(decrypted_ascii_code)
    
    # Update the encryption key by rotating it to the right
    key = key[1:] + key[0]
    
# Print the decrypted message
print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message)

# Output: Decrypted message: Secret message: HACKED! ~> œ`‚UT ‘ÑRñP>
