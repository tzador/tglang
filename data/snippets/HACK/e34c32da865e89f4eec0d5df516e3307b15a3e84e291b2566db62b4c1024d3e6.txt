// Declare variables

let sum; // variable to store sum of firstNum and secondNum
let diff; // variable to store difference of firstNum and secondNum
let prod; // variable to store product of firstNum and secondNum

// Calculate sum
sum = firstNum + secondNum; // assign sum to sum variable

// Calculate difference
diff = firstNum - secondNum; // assign difference to diff variable

// Calculate product
prod = firstNum * secondNum; // assign product to prod variable

// Print results

Expected output:

The sum of 5 and 10 is 15
The difference between 5 and 10 is -5
The product of 5 and 10 is 50
