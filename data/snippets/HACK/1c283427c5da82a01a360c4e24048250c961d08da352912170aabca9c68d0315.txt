# This snippet generates a random sequence of numbers using a linear congruential generator algorithm.

# Initializing the constants for the algorithm
a = 69069
b = 1
m = 259200
x = 12345

# Generating a sequence of 10 numbers
output = []

for i in range(10):
    # Calculating the next random number based on the previous one
    x = (a * x + b) % m
    
    # Appending the number to the output list
    output.append(x)

# Outputting the result
print(output)
