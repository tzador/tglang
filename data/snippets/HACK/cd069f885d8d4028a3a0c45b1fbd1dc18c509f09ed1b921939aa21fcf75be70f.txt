; This is a complex code snippet in HACK language
; It generates a Fibonacci sequence and checks if a given number is in the sequence

; Define variables for the first two numbers in the sequence
SET firstNumber TO 0
SET secondNumber TO 1

; Prompt user to enter a number to check
PROMPT "Enter a number to check: " WITH userInput

; Loop through the sequence until the sum exceeds the user's input
WHILE firstNumber + secondNumber < userInput DO
    ; Calculate the next number in the sequence
    SET nextNumber TO firstNumber + secondNumber

    ; Swap the variables for the next iteration
    SET firstNumber TO secondNumber
    SET secondNumber TO nextNumber
END WHILE

; Check if the input is equal to the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence
IF userInput = firstNumber + secondNumber THEN
    ; User input is in the Fibonacci sequence
    PRINT "That number is in the Fibonacci sequence!"
ELSE
    ; User input is not in the Fibonacci sequence
    PRINT "That number is not in the Fibonacci sequence."
