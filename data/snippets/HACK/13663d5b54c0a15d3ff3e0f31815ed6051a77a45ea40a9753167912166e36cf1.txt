# This is a complex code snippet written in the programming language "HACK".

# Declare a function named "hack_name" that takes in parameters "first" and "last" for the first and last name respectively.
# The function's purpose is to concatenate the first and last name and return it as a string.

function hack_name(first, last) {
    # Create an empty string variable "full_name" for the concatenated name to be stored in.
    var full_name = "";

    # Add the first name to the "full_name" variable.
    full_name += first;

    # Add a space between the first and last name.
    full_name += " ";

    # Add the last name to the "full_name" variable.
    full_name += last;

    # Return the concatenated full name.
    return full_name;
}

# Call the "hack_name" function with the arguments "John" and "Doe" and store the result in a variable named "full_name".
var full_name = hack_name("John", "Doe");

# Print the result to the console.
console.log(full_name);
