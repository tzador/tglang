;;; Annotated code snippet in the HACK programming language

;; Initialize a memory location
@0

;; Load a value into the A-register
D=M

;; Perform bitwise NOT operation on the value in the A-register
!D

;; Jump to a specified address in the program
0;JMP

;; Store the value in the A-register into the D-register
D=A

;; Loop through a block of code
(LOOP)
  ;; Decrement the value in the A-register by 1
  A=A-1

  ;; Check if the value is equal to 0
  D;JEQ

  ;; Output the value in the A-register
  @SCREEN
  A=M
  M=D

  ;; Infinite jump to the LOOP block
  @LOOP
  A;JMP
