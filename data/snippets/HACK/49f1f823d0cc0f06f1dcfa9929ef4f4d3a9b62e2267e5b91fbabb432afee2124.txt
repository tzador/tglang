### This is a code snippet in HACK

# Declare constant PI with value 3.14
CONST PI = 3.14

# Declare and define a function to calculate the area of a circle
FUNC calculateAreaOfCircle(radius):
  # Calculate the area using the formula A = PI * r^2
  LET area = PI * (radius ** 2)
  # Return the calculated area
  RET area

# Declare and define a variable to hold the user's input for the radius of a circle
LET input = PROMPT("Enter the radius of the circle:")

# Convert the input from a string to a float
LET radius = TO_FLOAT(input)

# Call the calculateAreaOfCircle function and store the returned value in a variable
LET circleArea = calculateAreaOfCircle(radius)

# Print the calculated area to the console
PRINT("The area of the circle with radius " + radius + " is " + circleArea)
