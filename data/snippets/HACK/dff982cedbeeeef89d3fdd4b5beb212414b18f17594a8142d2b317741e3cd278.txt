/**
 * This is a complex code snippet in HACK programming language.
 *
 * The function below takes in two parameters:
 *  - `num1` : a number value
 *  - `num2` : a number value
 * 
 * The function calculates the product of these two numbers and stores it in a variable called `product`.
 * 
 * The `product` variable is then used in a while loop, which runs for the value of `num1`.
 * 
 * The loop goes over each number from `0` to `num1` and multiplies each number with `product`.
 * The results are stored in an array called `multiples`.
 * 
 * Lastly, the `multiples` array is printed out as the final result of this code snippet.

    let counter = 0; // counter for the while loop
    let multiples = []; // storing the results of the loop
    while(counter < num1) { // loop runs for the value of num1
        multiples[counter] = product * counter; // calculates the multiple of product and current number
        counter++; // increasing the counter
    }

multiply(5, 8); // calling the function with two numbers - 5 and 8.
// Output: [0, 40, 80, 12, 160]
