### Recursive function for calculating the factorial of a number

function calculateFactorial(number){
	int result = 1			# initialize the result variable to 1
	if(number <= 1){		# check if the number is 1 or less
		return result		# if so, return 1 as factorial of 0 is 1
	}
	else{
		result = number * calculateFactorial(number - 1)		# recursively call the function with number-1
		return result		# return the result of the recursive call
	}
}

print(calculateFactorial(6))		# calling the function to calculate factorial of 6, output will be 720 for this example
