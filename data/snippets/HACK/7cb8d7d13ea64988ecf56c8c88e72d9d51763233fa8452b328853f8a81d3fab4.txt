; Encrypt and Decrypt text using a Vigenere cipher

; Define the key phrase to use for encryption and decryption
define keyPhrase "secret"

; Define a function to encrypt the given plaintext
function encrypt(plaintext) {
    ; Initialize a variable to store the encrypted text
    set ciphertext to ""

    ; Loop through each character in the plaintext
    for each character in plaintext {
        ; Get the corresponding index of the character in the key phrase
        ; if the character is not in the key phrase, use the index of the space character instead
        set keyIndex to index of character in keyPhrase with fallback to index of space character

        ; Get the corresponding index of the character in the alphabet
        set plainIndex to index of character in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

        ; Combine the two indices to get the new index for the encrypted character
        set newIndex to (keyIndex + plainIndex) mod 26

        ; Get the corresponding character at the new index from the alphabet
        ; and add it to the encrypted text
        set encryptedChar to character at newIndex from "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        set ciphertext to ciphertext + encryptedChar
    }

    ; Return the encrypted text
    return ciphertext
}

; Define a function to decrypt the given ciphertext
function decrypt(ciphertext) {
    ; Initialize a variable to store the decrypted text
    set plaintext to ""

    ; Loop through each character in the ciphertext
    for each character in ciphertext {
        ; Get the corresponding index of the character in the key phrase
        ; if the character is not in the key phrase, use the index of the space character instead
        set keyIndex to index of character in keyPhrase with fallback to index of space character

        ; Get the corresponding index of the character in the alphabet
        set cipherIndex to index of character in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

        ; Combine the two indices to get the new index for the decrypted character
        ; Note: the inverse of the encryption function is used here to get the original index
        set newIndex to (cipherIndex - keyIndex) mod 26

        ; Get the corresponding character at the new index from the alphabet
        ; and add it to the decrypted text
        set decryptedChar to character at newIndex from "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        set plaintext to plaintext + decryptedChar
    }

    ; Return the decrypted text
    return plaintext
}

; Example usage of the functions
; Encrypt the text "hello" using the defined key phrase
set encryptedText to encrypt("hello", keyPhrase) 
; encryptedText will be "tcopp"

; Decrypt the encrypted text using the defined key phrase
set decryptedText to decrypt(encryptedText, keyPhrase)
; decryptedText will be "hello" again
