# This code snippet generates a list of prime numbers up to a given number

# Define a function to check if a number is prime
fn is_prime(n):

    # We only need to check numbers up to the square root of n
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):

        # If the number is divisible by any number up to its square root, it is not prime
        if n % i == 0:

            # Return False if the number is not prime
            return False

    # If the for loop doesn't return False, the number is prime
    return True


# Get input from user for the upper limit of the prime numbers
print("Enter an upper limit for the prime numbers: ")

# Convert input to an integer
limit = int(input())

# Initialize an empty list to store prime numbers
primes = []

# Loop through numbers from 2 to the limit
for num in range(2, limit + 1):

    # Check if the number is prime using the is_prime function
    if is_prime(num):

        # Add the prime number to the list
        primes.append(num)


# Print the list of prime numbers
print("List of prime numbers up to", limit, "is: ", primes)

# Output:
# Enter an upper limit for the prime numbers:
# 20
# List of prime numbers up to 20 is: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
