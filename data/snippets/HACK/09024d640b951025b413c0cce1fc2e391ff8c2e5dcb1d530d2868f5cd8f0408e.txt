# This code snippet simulates a brute force attack on a password.
# It takes in a password as a string and uses a while loop to generate
# all possible combinations of characters and compare them to the password.

# Set the maximum length of the password
pass_len = 6

# List of characters to be used in the password
characters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"

# Initialize the brute force attack
iteration = 0
password_found = False

# Loop until password is found or maximum iterations reached
while iteration < (len(characters) ** pass_len) and not password_found:
    
    # Generate a possible password by combining characters in list
    possible_pass = ''
    for i in range(pass_len):
        index = (iteration // (len(characters) ** i)) % len(characters)
        possible_pass += characters[index]
    
    # Compare generated password to desired password
    if possible_pass == password:
        password_found = True
    
    # Increment iteration counter
    iteration += 1

# Print the result
if password_found:
    print("Password found: " + possible_pass)
else:
    print("Unable to brute force password.")
