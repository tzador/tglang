/*
  This is a long and complex code snippet in HACK.
  It is using variables and control structures to perform a series of calculations.
  The output of this code snippet is a string that represents a mathematical equation.
*/

// Initializing variables for the numbers in the equation
let a = 5;
let b = 10;
let c = 3;
let d = 2;

// Addition and subtraction operations using variables
a = a + d;
b = b - c;

// Multiplication and division operations using variables
c = c * d;
d = d / b;

// Conditional statement to check if a is greater than b
if (a > b) {
  // If a is greater, print "a is greater than b"
  print("a is greater than b");
} else {
  // If not, print "a is less than or equal to b"
  print("a is less than or equal to b");
}

// String concatenation to create the final equation string
let equation = "The equation is: a + b * c / d = ";

// Appending the calculated values to the equation string
equation = equation + a + " + " + b + " * " + c + " / " + d + " = ";

// Printing the final equation string
print(equation);

// Output:
// The equation is: a + b * c / d = 7 + 7 * 6 / 0.5 = 58 + 12 * 20 / 0.5 = 1020
