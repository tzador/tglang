# This code snippet is written in a programming language called HACK.
# HACK is a language used for web development, mainly for creating dynamic web pages.
#
# In this code snippet, we will create a complex function that takes in two parameters
# and returns the sum of their squares.
#
# Firstly, we define the function square that takes in one parameter x and returns the square of x
function square(x) {
    return x * x;
}

# Next, we define the addSquares function that takes in two parameters, num1 and num2
# Within the function, we call the square function twice, passing in the two parameters
# and store the result in a variable called sum.
# Then, we return the value of sum, which is the sum of the squares of num1 and num2.
function addSquares(num1, num2) {
    let sum = square(num1) + square(num2);
    return sum;
}

# Now, we call the addSquares function and pass in two numbers - 5 and 3.
# The function will return the sum of their squares, which is 34.
addSquares(5, 3); // Output: 34

# This code snippet showcases the use of functions, parameters, and variables in the HACK programming language.
# It also demonstrates the concept of calling functions within other functions to perform more complex tasks.
