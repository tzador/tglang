# This code snippet is a simple sorting algorithm in the HACK programming language.
# It takes in an array of numbers and sorts them in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.

# Define a function to perform bubble sort
func BubbleSort(arr):
    # Set a temporary variable to hold the value during swapping
    temp = 0

    # Loop through the array, comparing adjacent elements
    for i in range(length(arr)):
        for j in range(length(arr)-1):
            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                temp = arr[j]
                arr[j] = arr[j+1]
                arr[j+1] = temp

# Initialize an array of numbers to be sorted
arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 3]

# Call the BubbleSort function to sort the array
BubbleSort(arr)

# Print the sorted array
print(arr)
