# This is a function that generates a secure password

### This function uses various methods such as
### cryptographic hashing, random number generation, and character encoding to create a strong password

CREATE FUNCTION generate_password() 
  # Initialize an empty string to store the password
  SET password = "" 

  # Generate a random number to determine the length of the password
  SET length = RANDOM(10, 15)

  # Use a loop to generate random characters for the password
  FOR i = 0 TO length
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 3 to choose a method
    SET method = RANDOM(1, 3)

    # Generate a random character using cryptographic hashing
    IF method == 1
      SET char = HASH(RANDOM(32))

    # Generate a random character using character encoding
    IF method == 2
      SET char = ENCODE(RANDOM(255))

    # Generate a random character using a combination of methods
    IF method == 3
      SET char = HASH(RANDOM(16)) + ENCODE(RANDOM(128))

    # Append the new character to the password string
    password = password + char

  # Return the generated password
  RETURN password

# Call the function to generate a password and store the result in a variable
SET secure_password = generate_password() 

# Print the password to the console
PRINT `Your secure password is:` secure_password

# Save the password in a text file for future reference
