#This is a code snippet written in the programming language 'HACK'

#The following code creates a function that takes in an integer as an argument and generates a list of prime numbers up to that integer.

def generate_prime_list(limit):
  # initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
  primes = []
  # loop through numbers from 2 to the limit
  for num in range(2, limit + 1):
    # initially assume the number is prime
    is_prime = True
    # check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root
    for div in range(2, int(num**0.5)+1):
      # if the number is divisible by any number, it is not prime
      if num % div == 0:
        is_prime = False
        # break out of the loop because we have already determined it is not prime
        break
    # if the number is still marked as prime, add it to the list
    if is_prime:
      primes.append(num)
  # return the list of prime numbers
  return primes
  
# call the function and store the result in a variable
result = generate_prime_list(100)

# print the result
print(result)
