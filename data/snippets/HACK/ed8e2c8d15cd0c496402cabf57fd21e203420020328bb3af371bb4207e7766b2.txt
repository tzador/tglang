;; This code snippet is written in the programming language HACK.
;; It prints the first 20 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

;; Declare a constant variable 'NUM' with the value of 20
CONST NUM = 20

;; Declare an empty array 'fibonacciArr' to hold the sequence
ARR fibonacciArr[]

;; Declare variable 'current' to hold the current number being calculated
VAR current

;; Use a for loop to generate the sequence
FOR i = 0 TO NUM-1 DO
    ;; If i is less than or equal to 1, the current number is 1
    IF i <= 1 THEN
        SET current = 1
    ELSE
        ;; Calculate the current number by adding the last two numbers in the array
        SET current = fibonacciArr[i-1] + fibonacciArr[i-2]
    END IF
    ;; Append the current number to the array
    fibonacciArr->ADD(current)
END FOR

;; Print the sequence
FOR i = 0 TO NUM-1 DO
    ;; Use inline comment to label the output
    `Prints the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence`
    OUT fibonacciArr[i]
END FOR
