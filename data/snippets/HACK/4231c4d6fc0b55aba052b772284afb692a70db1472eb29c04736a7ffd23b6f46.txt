//this code snippet implements a function to find the average of a list of numbers

//function definition of average
function average(list) {
    //declare and initialize variables
    let sum = 0;
    let count = 0;

    //loop through the list of numbers
    for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        //add each element to the sum
        sum += list[i];
        //increment the count
        count++;
    }

    //calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count
    let average = sum / count;

    //return the average
    return average;
}

//example list of numbers
let numbers = [5, 7, 2, 9, 3, 12, 4];

//call the average function and store the result in a variable
let averageResult = average(numbers);

//print the result to the console
console.log(`The average of the numbers is ${averageResult}`); //Output: The average of the numbers is 6
