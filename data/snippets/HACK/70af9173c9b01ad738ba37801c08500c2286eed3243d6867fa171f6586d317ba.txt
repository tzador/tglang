# This code snippet is a demonstration of a recursive function in HACK,
# which prints the factorial of a given number.
# It takes an integer as an argument and returns an integer as the output.

factorial =: (n) {
    # Base case: if the number is 0, return 1.
    if (n = 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    # Recursive case: call the same function with n-1 as the argument,
    # and multiply it with n to get the factorial.
    return n * factorial(n-1);
}

# Call the function with a given number and store the result in a variable.
result = factorial(5);

# Print the factorial of the given number.
printf("The factorial of 5 is: %d\n", result);
