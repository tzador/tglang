;;; This is a Hack program that implements a simple calculator ;;;

;; Define a push function that takes in a value and pushes it onto the stack ;;
(define (push val)
  (set! mem[val] (car stack))
  (set! stack (cons val stack)))

;; Define a pop function that pops the top value off the stack ;;
(define (pop)
  (let ((val (car stack)))
    (set! stack (cdr stack))
    val))

;; Define a function for addition that takes two values off the stack, adds them, and pushes the result back onto the stack ;;
(define (add)
  (push (+ (pop) (pop))))

;; Define a function for subtraction that takes two values off the stack, subtracts them, and pushes the result back onto the stack ;;
(define (sub)
  (push (- (pop) (pop))))

;; Define a function for multiplication that takes two values off the stack, multiplies them, and pushes the result back onto the stack ;;
(define (mul)
  (push (* (pop) (pop))))

;; Define a function for division that takes two values off the stack, divides them, and pushes the result back onto the stack ;;
(define (div)
  (push (/ (pop) (pop))))

;; Define a function for exponentiation that takes two values off the stack, raises the first value to the power of the second value, and pushes the result back onto the stack ;;
(define (exp)
  (push (expt (pop) (pop))))

;; Define a function for modulus that takes two values off the stack, calculates the remainder when the first value is divided by the second value, and pushes the result back onto the stack ;;
(define (mod)
  (push (remainder (pop) (pop))))

;; Define a function for negation that takes a value off the stack, negates it, and pushes the result back onto the stack ;;
(define (neg)
  (push (- (pop))))

;; Define a function for comparison that takes two values off the stack and pushes 1 onto the stack if the first value is greater, 0 if they are equal, and -1 if the second value is greater ;;
(define (comp)
  (let ((val2 (pop))
        (val1 (pop)))
    (if (> val1 val2)
        (push 1)
        (if (= val1 val2)
            (push 0)
            (push -1)))))

;; Define a function for conditional execution that takes a boolean value off the stack and executes the next command if the value is 1 ;;
(define (cond)
  (let ((val (pop)))
    (if (= val 1)
        (execute (pop))
        (pop))))

;; Define a function for loop execution that takes a number off the stack and executes the next command that many times ;;
(define (loop)
  (let ((num (pop)))
    (let loop ()
      (if (= num 0)
          '()

            (execute (pop))
            (set! num (- num 1))
            (loop))))))

;; Define a function for printing the top value on the stack ;;
(define (print)
  (display (car stack)))

;; Define a function for reading user input and pushing it onto the stack ;;
(define (read)
  (let ((input (read)))
    (push input)))

;; Define a function for executing the next instruction based on the opcode ;;
(define (execute opcode)
  (cond ((= opcode 1) (add))
        ((= opcode 2) (sub))
        ((= opcode 3) (mul))

        ((= opcode 10) (loop))
        ((= opcode 11) (print))
        ((= opcode 12) (read))))

;; Main program starts here ;;
(define mem (make-vector 100 0)) ; Initialize memory vector to store values pushed onto the stack
(define stack '()) ; Initialize stack for storing values

;; Take user input for first value and push it onto the stack ;;
(display "Enter first value: ")
(read)

;; Take user input for second value and push it onto the stack ;;
(display "Enter second value: ")
(read)

;; Take user input for operation and push its corresponding opcode onto the stack ;;
(display "Enter operation (1 for add, 2 for subtract, 3 for multiply, 4 for divide, 5 for exponentiation, 6 for modulus, 7 for negation, 8 for comparison, 9 for conditional execution, 10 for loop, 11 for print, 12 for read): ")
(read)

;; Execute the operation based on the opcode at the top of the stack ;;
(execute (pop))

;; Print the result, which is the top value on the stack ;;
(print)
