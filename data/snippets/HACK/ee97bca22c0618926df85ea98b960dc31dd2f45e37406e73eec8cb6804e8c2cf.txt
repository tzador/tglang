#This is a code snippet in HACK programming language
set x as 5   #set a variable x to the value 5
set y as 10  #set a variable y to the value 10

if x > y:   #if statement to check if x is greater than y
  print "x is greater than y"   #print statement if condition is true
  set z as x * y   #set a variable z to the result of multiplying x and y
  print "z is equal to " + z   #print statement to display the value of z

elif x < y:   #else if statement to check if x is less than y
  print "x is less than y"   #print statement if condition is true
  set z as x / y  #set a variable z to the result of dividing x by y
  print "z is equal to " + z   #print statement to display the value of z

else:   #else statement if none of the previous conditions are met
  print "x is equal to y"   #print statement if condition is true
  set z as x + y   #set a variable z to the result of adding x and y
