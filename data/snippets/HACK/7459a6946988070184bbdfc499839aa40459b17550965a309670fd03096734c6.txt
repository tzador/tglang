# This is a sample code snippet in the programming language 'HACK'.

# Declare a variable called 'password' and assign it the value 'mySuperSecretPassw0rd!'.
password = 'mySuperSecretPassw0rd!'

# Create a function called 'encrypt' that takes in a string parameter 'message'.
def encrypt(message):
    # Initialize an empty list to store encrypted characters.
    encrypted = []
    # Loop through each character in the input message.
    for char in message:
        # Convert the character to its ASCII code.
        ascii_code = ord(char)
        # Add 5 to the ASCII code.
        ascii_code += 5
        # Convert the new ASCII code back to a character.
        encrypted_char = chr(ascii_code)
        # Append the encrypted character to the list.
        encrypted.append(encrypted_char)
    # Convert the list of encrypted characters to a string.
    encrypted_message = ''.join(encrypted)
    # Return the encrypted message.
    return encrypted_message

# Call the 'encrypt' function and pass in the 'password' variable as the argument.
encrypted_password = encrypt(password)

# Print the encrypted password.
print(encrypted_password)

# Output: "r|Xz\u0014z\u0014z\u0013\nl\u0016!8v\u0017z<#'@>'\u0003E"
