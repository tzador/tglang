; This code snippet generates a secure password using a combination of numbers, letters, and special characters
; Initialize variables
set numCount to 0
set letCount to 0
set specCount to 0
set password to ""

; Generate random numbers
for i from 1 to 4:
  set num to random number between 0 and 9
  set password to password + num
  set numCount to numCount + 1

; Generate random letters
for i from 1 to 4:
  set letter to random character between 'a' and 'z'
  set password to password + letter
  set letCount to letCount + 1

; Generate random special characters
for i from 1 to 2:
  set specChar to random character from special character array
  set password to password + specChar
  set specCount to specCount + 1

; Shuffle password characters
set passwordCharArray to characters of password
set shuffledPassword to empty string

while length of passwordCharArray is not 0:
  set randomIndex to random number between 1 and length of passwordCharArray
  set shuffledPassword to shuffledPassword + passwordCharArray[randomIndex]
  remove passwordCharArray[randomIndex]

; Ensure at least one number, letter, and special character in password
if numCount is 0:
  set num to random number between 0 and 9
  set randomIndex to random number between 0 and length of shuffledPassword
  set shuffledPassword[randomIndex] to numCount

if letCount is 0:
  set letter to random character between 'a' and 'z'
  set randomIndex to random number between 0 and length of shuffledPassword
  set shuffledPassword[randomIndex] to letter

if specCount is 0:
  set specChar to random character from special character array
  set randomIndex to random number between 0 and length of shuffledPassword
  set shuffledPassword[randomIndex] to specChar

; Output generated password
print shuffledPassword
