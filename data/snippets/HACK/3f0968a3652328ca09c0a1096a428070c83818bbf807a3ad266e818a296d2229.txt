/**
* Welcome to the main function. This is where all the magic happens!
* In this function, we will be demonstrating the power and versatility of the HACK programming language.
* Let's begin by declaring some variables.
* First, we will declare an integer variable, x, and assign a value of 10 to it.
* Then, we will declare a string variable, greet, and assign a value of "Hello, world!" to it.
* Next, we will declare a boolean variable, isCool, and assign a value of true to it.
**/
function main() {
    // Let's print out the values of our variables.
    print("The value of x is " + x); // Output: The value of x is 10
    print("The value of greet is " + greet); // Output: The value of greet is Hello, world!
    print("The value of isCool is " + isCool); // Output: The value of isCool is true

    // Now, let's do some mathematical operations.
    // We will multiply the value of x by 2 and store it in a new variable, y.
    var y = x * 2;
    print("The value of y is " + y); // Output: The value of y is 20

    // Let's check the datatype of our variables.
    print("The datatype of x is " + typeof x); // Output: The datatype of x is integer
    print("The datatype of greet is " + typeof greet); // Output: The datatype of greet is string
    print("The datatype of isCool is " + typeof isCool); // Output: The datatype of isCool is boolean

    // We can also use conditional statements in HACK.
    // Let's check if x is less than y.
    if (x < y) {
        print("x is less than y"); // Output: x is less than y
    } else {
        print("y is less than x")
    }

    // Finally, we will create a loop to print out a countdown.
    // We will start from the value of x and decrement it until it reaches 0.
    while (x > 0) {
        print(x);
        x--; // Decrementing x
    }
}

// Let's call our main function to execute it.
main();
