# This is a code snippet in the HACK programming language.
#
# HACK is a proprietary programming language used for backend web development.
# It is known for its speed and security features.
#
# This code snippet creates a custom function that accepts two parameters
# and returns the sum of their squares.
#
# The 'def' keyword is used to define a function, followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses.
def square_sum(x, y):
    # The 'var' keyword is used to declare a variable.
    # In this case, the result of the sum of squares will be stored in the 'total' variable.
    var total = 0

    # The 'for' loop is used to iterate through a block of code a certain number of times.
    # In this case, it will run for two iterations, each time increasing the 'i' variable by 1.
    for i in range(2):
        # The '**' operator is used to calculate the power of a number.
        # In this case, it is used to square the value of 'x' and 'y'.
        # The result is then added to 'total'.
        total = total + x ** 2
        total = total + y ** 2

    # The 'return' keyword is used to specify the value that should be returned from the function.
    return total

# We call the function and pass in the values 3 and 4 as arguments.
# The expected output should be 25.
