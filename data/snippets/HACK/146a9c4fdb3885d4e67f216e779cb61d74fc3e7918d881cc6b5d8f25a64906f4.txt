# This code snippet implements a function to calculate the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers
# The function takes in an integer n as input and returns the sum as output

# Function to calculate the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers
def sum_fibonacci(n):
    # Initialize the sum variable
    sum = 0
    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
    num1 = 0
    num2 = 1
    # Loop from 0 to n (exclusive)
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number
        # by adding the previous two numbers
        new_num = num1 + num2
        # Update the sum with the new number
        sum += new_num
        # Update the previous two numbers
        num1 = num2
        num2 = new_num
    # Return the sum
    return sum

# Example output: Sum of first 6 Fibonacci numbers = 20
print(sum_fibonacci(6))

# Output: Sum of first 6 Fibonacci numbers = 20
