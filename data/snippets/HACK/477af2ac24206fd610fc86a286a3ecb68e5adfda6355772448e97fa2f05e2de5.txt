;;; This is a code snippet written in HACK, a language developed at Facebook for web development

;;; Define a function that prints "Hello World!" to the console
(defun print-hello-world ()
    (print "Hello World!"))

;;; Define two variables, one containing a string and the other an integer
(variable name "John")
(variable age 25)

;;; Create a conditional statement that checks if the variable "age" is equal to 25
(if (equal age 25)
    (print "You are 25 years old!"))

;;; Use a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10 to the console
(loop for i from 1 to 10 do
    (print i))

;;; Define a list containing strings
(list "apple" "banana" "orange" "grape")

;;; Create a class called "Person" with properties "name" and "age"
(class Person
    (property name)
    (property age))

;;; Create an instance of the Person class with the name "Emily" and age 30
(instance Emily Person "Emily" 30)

;;; Define a function that returns the concatenation of two strings
(defun concatenate-strings (str1 str2)
    (concat str1 str2))

;;; Call the function with two strings and print the result
(print (concatenate-strings "Hello" " World!"))
