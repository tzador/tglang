# This code snippet is written in HACK, a programming language developed by Facebook for their HHVM virtual machine.

var $a = 5;   // Declaring a variable 'a' and assigning it the value of 5.

// Using a for loop to iterate 10 times.
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    $a += 2;   // Incrementing the value of 'a' by 2 each time the loop runs.
}

// Declaring a function that takes in two parameters.
function multiply($x, $y) {
    return $x * $y;   // Returning the result of multiplying the two parameters.
}

var $b = multiply(3, 4);   // Calling the function and assigning the returned value to variable 'b'.
echo "The value of b is: " . $b;   // Outputting the result to the console.

/* This section demonstrates the use of arrays in HACK. An array is a data structure that can store multiple values in a single variable.
In this case, we are creating an array of names and then using a foreach loop to iterate through the array and print out each name. */

var $names = array("John", "Jane", "Bob", "Alice");   // Creating an array with 4 names.
foreach ($names as $name) {   // Iterating through the array and assigning each name to the variable 'name'.
    echo $name . "\n";   // Outputting the name to the console.
}

// Using the inbuilt map function in HACK to perform a calculation on each element of an array and return a new array with the results.
var $numbers = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
var $squared_numbers = map($numbers, function($n) {
    return $n * $n;   // Squaring each number in the array and returning the result.
});

echo $squared_numbers;   // Outputting the new array to the console. Might look something like this: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

// This is just a small example of the capabilities of the HACK programming language. With its strong typing and optimized performance, it is a popular choice for large-scale web applications.
