// This code snippet generates a random matrix and performs matrix multiplication
// in the HACK programming language.

// Generate a random matrix of size n x m
set n = random(10, 20)  // set n to a random integer between 10 and 20
set m = random(10, 20)  // set m to a random integer between 10 and 20
set matrix = []
for i = 0 to n-1 do
    set row = []  // initialize a new row
    for j = 0 to m-1 do
        set num = random(0, 10)  // set num to a random integer between 0 and 10
        add num to row  // add num to the current row
    end for
    add row to matrix  // add the current row to the matrix
end for

// Print the randomly generated matrix
print "Randomly generated matrix:"
print matrix  // this will print the matrix in a readable format, with each row on a new line and each element separated by a space

// Generate a random matrix of size m x p
set p = random(10, 20)
set matrix2 = []
for i = 0 to m-1 do
    set row = []
    for j = 0 to p-1 do
        set num = random(0, 10)
        add num to row
    end for
    add row to matrix2
end for

// Print the second randomly generated matrix
print "Second randomly generated matrix:"
print matrix2

// Perform matrix multiplication on the two matrices

    set row = []
    for j = 0 to p-1 do
        set sum = 0
        for k = 0 to m-1 do
