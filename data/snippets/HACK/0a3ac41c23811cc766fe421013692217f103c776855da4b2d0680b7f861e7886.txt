''' These triple apostrophes denote a multi-line comment in HACK.
This is another comment line in the same multi-line comment block.
Here we will define a function named "fibonacci" which takes in an integer
and returns the corresponding number in the fibonacci sequence. '''

def fibonacci(n):
    # Initialize two variables, "a" and "b", to the first two values in the fibonacci sequence
    a = 0
    b = 1
    
    # Loop through the specified number of times and update the values of "a" and "b" accordingly
    for i in range(n):
        temp = a + b # temporary variable to store the sum of "a" and "b"
        a = b # update "a" to the value of "b"
        b = temp # update "b" to the temporary variable's value
    
    return a # return the final value of "a", which will be the fibonacci number at index "n"

# This is a function call and print statement using string formatting to output the fibonacci number at index 10
print("The fibonacci number at index 10 is: {}".format(fibonacci(10))) 
''' This is the end of the function and print statement block. The output will be:
"The fibonacci number at index 10 is: 55" since the 10th number in the fibonacci sequence is 55.'''
