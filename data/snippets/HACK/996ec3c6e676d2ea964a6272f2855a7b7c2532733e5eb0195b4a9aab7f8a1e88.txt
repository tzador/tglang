# This code snippet is a function in HACK that checks if a given number is a prime number.
func isPrime(num):
    sqrt_num = sqrt(num) //calculate square root of num
    i = 2 //set counter to start at 2
    while i <= sqrt_num: //loop until counter reaches square root of num
        if num % i == 0: //if num is divisible by i, return false
            return False //num is not prime
        i = i + 1 //increment counter
    return True //if loop completes, num is prime
