HACK is a high-level, statically-typed language developed at Facebook for their Hack webserve.
This language was built to enhance the PHP syntax, providing features such as static typing and generics. */

/* This snippet demonstrates a simple function that calculates the factorial of a given number. */

// Define a function named 'factorial' that takes in a single parameter 'num'
function factorial(num) {

    // Initialize a variable 'result' to store the factorial value
    $result = 1;

    /* Use a for loop to iterate through all the numbers from 1 to the given number,
    and multiply the current value of 'result' by the current number in each iteration. */
    for($i = 1; $i <= $num; $i++) {
        $result = $result * $i;
    }

    // Return the final value of 'result'

}

// Call the 'factorial' function with the number 5 and store the result in a variable 'answer'
$answer = factorial(5);

// Print the value of 'answer' to the console
echo "The factorial of 5 is: " . $answer;

/* Output:
The factorial of 5 is: 120
