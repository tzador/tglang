;====================================== Code snippet in HACK ======================================;

; This code snippet uses the BANKED and IO instructions to read and write to different memory banks.

; Set the BANKED flag to 1 to enable banked memory access
SET BANKED, 1

; Define memory addresses for different banks
; For this example, we will use bank 0 for general purpose and bank 1 for input/output operations
SET BANK_0, #0010
SET BANK_1, #0110

; Write a value to bank 0
; First, set the MAR (memory address register) to point to the desired bank
SET MAR, BANK_0
; Then, use the IO instruction to write the value to the address contained in MAR
IO, #0101

; Read a value from bank 1
; Similar to writing, first set the MAR to point to the desired bank
SET MAR, BANK_1
; Then, use the IO instruction with the READ flag to read the value from the address contained in MAR
IO READ, #0000

; Print the value to the console
; Set the PRINT flag to 1 to enable printing
SET PRINT, 1
; Use the IO instruction with the PRINT flag to print the value stored in the accumulator
IO PRINT, ACC

; Clear the BANKED flag to disable banked memory access
SET BANKED, 0

; Set the MAR to point to the general purpose bank
SET MAR, BANK_0
; Use the IO instruction with the READ flag to read a value from this bank
IO READ, #0001
; Set the accumulator to the value read
SET ACC, MAR

; Perform some operations with the value
ADD #0010
MUL #0002

; Write the result to bank 0
SET MAR, BANK_0
IO, ACC

; Clear the PRINT flag
SET PRINT, 0
