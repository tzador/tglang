; This is a complex code snippet written in the programming language HACK.
; It includes a mix of variable declarations, conditional statements, and loops.

; --- Variable Declarations ---
define main:
    ; Declare a variable x and initialize it to an empty array.
    set x to []

    ; Declare a variable y and initialize it to 10.
    set y to 10
    
    ; Declare a variable z and initialize it to "Hello, World!".
    set z to "Hello, World!"

; --- Conditional Statements ---
    ; Check if y is equal to 10.
    if (y == 10) {
        
        ; If y is equal to 10, print "Equal!" to the console.
        console.log("Equal!")
    }

    ; Check if z is not equal to "Goodbye".
    if (z != "Goodbye") {

        ; If z is not equal to "Goodbye", print "Not equal!" to the console.
        console.log("Not equal!")
    }

; --- Loops ---
    ; Initialize a for loop that will run 10 times.
    for (i=0; i < 10; i++) {

        ; Within the loop, add i to the array x.
        x.push(i)
    }

    ; Initialize a while loop that will run while y is greater than 0.
    while (y > 0) {

        ; Within the loop, subtract 1 from y.
        y -= 1
    }

; --- Output ---
    ; Print the contents of the array x to the console.
    console.log(x)
    
    ; Print the current value of y to the console.
    console.log(y)

; End of main function.
