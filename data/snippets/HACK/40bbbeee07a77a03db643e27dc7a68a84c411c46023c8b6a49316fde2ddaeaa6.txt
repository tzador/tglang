//This code snippet demonstrates a simple binary search algorithm in HACK (Hacking All Code Kinks)

//Function to perform binary search on a sorted array
//Params:
  //arr - The sorted array to be searched
  //key - The element to be searched for in the array
//Return:
  //The index of the element in the array, or -1 if element is not found
//
function binarySearch(arr, key) {
  
  //Initializing variables
  let low = 0; //Starting index of array
  let high = arr.length - 1; //Ending index of array
  
  //Loop until search space has at least one element
  while (low <= high) {
    
    //Calculate midpoint of array
    let mid = Math.floor(low + (high - low) / 2);
    
    //If element is found at midpoint, return index
    if (arr[mid] === key)
      return mid;
    
    //If element is less than midpoint, search left side of array
    else if (arr[mid] > key)
      high = mid - 1;
    
    //If element is greater than midpoint, search right side of array
    else
      low = mid + 1;
  }
  
  //Element not found, return -1
  return -1;
}

//Example usage
let sortedArr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13];
let key = 5;
let result = binarySearch(sortedArr, key);
console.log("The index of", key, "in sortedArr is:", result); //Output: The index of 5 in sortedArr is: 2
