;HACK CODE SNIPPET

; This code snippet uses the HACK assembly language to perform a complex mathematical operation.

;initialize variables
    @sum //accumulator
    M=0 //set accumulator to 0
    @count //counter
    M=1 //set counter to 1
    @factor //factor variable
    M=1 //set factor to 1

(DOUBLE_LOOP)
    //Outer loop to loop through counter values
    @count
    D=M //load count value into D register
    @2 //load value 2 into A register
    D=D-A //subtract 2 from count value
    D;JLT //if result is negative, jump to END_LOOP
    @factor //load factor value into A register
    D=D*M //multiply count value by factor value
    M=D //store result in factor variable
    
    //Inner loop to calculate factorial of count value
    @count
    D=M //load count value into D register
    @factor //load factor value into A register
    D=D*M //multiply count value by factor value
    @sum //load sum variable into A register
    M=M+D //add result to current value of sum variable
    
    @count //increment count by 1
    M=M+1
    
    @DOUBLE_LOOP //jump to start of DOUBLE_LOOP
    0;JMP

(END_LOOP)
    @sum //load sum variable into A register
    D=M //load sum value into D register
    @RESULT //set label for output
    M=D //store result in RESULT label

(END)
    @END //end program
    0;JMP //jump to itself to end program

(END) //end of code snippet
