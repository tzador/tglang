# This code snippet is written in the HACK programming language, a low-level language used for hardware manipulation and system programming.
 
# The following code implements a quicksort algorithm
 
define function quicksort(arr) 
# Defines a function named "quicksort" which takes in an array as a parameter
 
    if length(arr) < 2:
    # Checks if the length of the array is less than 2, if so, return the array as it is already sorted
      
        return arr; 
        # Returns the array as it is already sorted
    
    else:
    # If the length of the array is greater than 2, continue with the sorting process
        
        pivot = arr[first];
        # Sets a pivot element as the first element in the array
        
        smaller = [element for element in arr[1:] if element < pivot];
        # Creates a new array containing elements smaller than the pivot element
        
        greater = [element for element in arr[1:] if element > pivot];
        # Creates a new array containing elements greater than the pivot element
        
        return quicksort(smaller) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater);
        # Recursively calls the quicksort function on the smaller and greater arrays, and concatenates them with the pivot element in between
 
# Example usage:
 
input = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3];
# Creates an input array
 
output = quicksort(input);
# Calls the quicksort function on the input array and assigns the sorted array to the "output" variable
 
print(output);
# Prints the sorted array, output will be [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
