# This code snippet is a function that takes in a list of numbers and sorts them in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

    Bubble Sort Algorithm:
    - Takes in a list of numbers
    - Compares adjacent numbers and swaps them if they are in the wrong order
    - Continues to loop through the list until all numbers are in the correct order
    - Returns the sorted list in ascending order

# Example Usage:
unsorted_list = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3, 7]
sorted_list = bubble_sort(unsorted_list)
print(sorted_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9]
