# HACK is a syntactic sugar for PHP developed by Facebook for their HHVM
# It includes added features such as type annotations and collections, making it more secure and efficient

// Declaring a function with a return value of string
function say_hello(): string {
    return "Hello, World!";
}

// Declaring a variable with type annotation of string
string $name = "John";

// Using the say_hello() function and concatenating it with the $name variable
echo say_hello() . " My name is " . $name;

// Declaring a class with type annotation of int for the $id property
class User {
    int $id;

    // Constructor method to set the $id property
    function __construct(int $id) {
        $this->id = $id;
    }

    // Function to get the $id property value
    function get_id(): int {
        return $this->id;
    }
}

// Creating an instance of the User class and passing an integer as the argument for the $id property
$user = new User(12345);

// Calling the get_id() function on the $user instance
echo $user->get_id();
