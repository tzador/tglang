###This code snippet utilizes the 'HACK' programming language to generate a complex and long code section###

//Initializing variables for manipulation
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int c = 0;

//Loop through values from 1 to 10
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {

    //Perform arithmetic operations on the variables
    c += a * b + (i * 2);

    //Print the updated value of c
    printf("The value of c is %d\n", c);

    //Conditionals to check the value of c
    if (c > 50) {
        //Reset the value of c if it exceeds 50
        c = c / 2;
    } else if (c < 20) {
        //Multiply c by 3 if it is less than 20
        c *= 3;
    }

    //Create nested loop to perform more operations
    for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
        //Square the value of a and add it to the value of b
        b += (a * a);
        //Subtract j from b
        b -= j;
    }

    //Print the updated value of b
    printf("The value of b is %d\n", b);
}

//Final output of the code snippet
printf("The final value of c is %d and the final value of b is %d", c, b);
