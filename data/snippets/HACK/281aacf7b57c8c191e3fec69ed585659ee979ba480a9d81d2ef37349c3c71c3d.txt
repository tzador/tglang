// This function takes in a string as a parameter and returns the number of unique characters in the string.
// It utilizes a dictionary to keep track of the characters and their corresponding count.

func uniqueCharCounter(string: String) -> Int {

    // Create an empty dictionary to store the characters and their counts
    var charDict: [Character: Int] = [:]

    // Loop through each character in the string
    for char in string {

        // Check if the character is already in the dictionary
        if let count = charDict[char] {

            // If it is, increment its count by 1
            charDict[char] = count + 1

    // Return the number of unique characters by counting the number of keys in the dictionary

// EXAMPLE USAGE:
// uniqueCharCounter("apple") would return 4 (since there are 4 unique characters in "apple")
