// This is a complex code snippet in the programming language HACK.

// First we declare a function that takes in two variables, a and b.
function calculate(a, b) {

  // Next, we define the operations to be performed on the variables.
  let sum = a + b;
  let difference = a - b;
  let product = a * b;
  let quotient = a / b;

  // Then, we create a for loop to iterate through the values.
  for (let i = 0; i < a; i++) {

    // We use conditional statements to perform different actions depending on the value of i.
    if (i === 0) {
      sum += i;
    } else if (i % 2 === 0) {
      difference *= i;
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      product /= i;
    } else {
      quotient *= i;
    }
  }

  // Lastly, we return the calculated values in a formatted string.
  return `
    The sum of ${a} and ${b} is: ${sum}.
    The difference of ${a} and ${b} is: ${difference}.
    The product of ${a} and ${b} is: ${product}.
    The quotient of ${a} and ${b} is: ${quotient}.
