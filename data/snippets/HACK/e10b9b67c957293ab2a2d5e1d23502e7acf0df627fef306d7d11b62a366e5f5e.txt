### Function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
### Input: max_num - the maximum number in the sequence

### Initialize a list to store the sequence
seq = [0, 1]

### Loop through numbers from 2 to max_num
for num in range(2, max_num):
    ### Add the previous two numbers in the sequence to get the next number
    next_num = seq[-1] + seq[-2]
    ### Append the next number to the sequence
    seq.append(next_num)

### Print the generated sequence
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", max_num, ":", seq)
