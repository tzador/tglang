## CODE SNIPPET IN HACK ##

// This program generates a random quote from a list of quotes

// Define an array of quotes
var quotes = [
    "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.",
    "All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.",
    "The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.",
    "It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.",
    "It always seems impossible until it is done."
];

// Randomly select a quote from the array
var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length);
var randomQuote = quotes[randomIndex];

// Print the quote to the console
console.log(randomQuote);

// Output: A random quote from the list of quotes will be printed to the console.
