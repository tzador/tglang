# [Description]: This code snippet performs a brute-force password guess attack on a given encrypted file using a dictionary of possible passwords.
pass_file = open("encrypted_file.txt", "r") # open the encrypted file to be cracked
dictionary = open("password_dictionary.txt", "r") # open the dictionary of possible passwords

encrypted_pass = pass_file.read() # read the encrypted password from the file
passwords = dictionary.readlines() # read all the lines in the dictionary into a list

for password in passwords: # iterate through each password in the dictionary
    decrypted_pass = "" # initialize an empty string for the decrypted password
    for i in range(len(password)): # iterate through each character in the password
        decrypted_pass += chr(ord(password[i]) ^ ord(encrypted_pass[i % len(password)])) # XOR each character of the password with the corresponding character in the encrypted password
    if decrypted_pass == password: # check if the decrypted password matches the one in the dictionary
        print("Password found:", password) # print the cracked password
        break # end the loop once a valid password is found
