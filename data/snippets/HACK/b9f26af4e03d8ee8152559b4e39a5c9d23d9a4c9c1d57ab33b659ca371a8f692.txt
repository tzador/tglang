## Explanation of the code:

- The first line sets the counter variable to 0.
- Next, a label is created for the start of the loop.
- The value of the counter variable is pushed onto the stack.
- 1 is added to the top of the stack.
- The top of the stack is popped and set to the counter variable.
- The current value of the counter variable is printed.
- The program jumps back to the label for the start of the loop, creating a loop.
- Once the loop is complete, the program ends.
