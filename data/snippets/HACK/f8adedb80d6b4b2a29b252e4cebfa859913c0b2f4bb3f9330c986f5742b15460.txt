##Function to calculate Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci_sequence:

  #Declaration of variables
  var current_number = 0
  var next_number = 1
  var temp_number = 0
  var number_of_iterations = 10
  
  #Loop to generate Fibonacci sequence
  loop:
    #Print current number
    print(current_number)
    
    #Update current number and next number
    temp_number = current_number
    current_number = next_number
    next_number = temp_number + current_number
    
    #Decrease number of iterations by 1
    number_of_iterations = number_of_iterations - 1
    
    #Check if number of iterations is 0, if yes, exit loop
    if (number_of_iterations == 0):
      exit loop
      
    #Else, continue loop
    repeat loop
    
  #End of function
  end fibonacci_sequence

#Calling the function
