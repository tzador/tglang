; Welcome to the HACK programming language
; This code snippet generates a list of prime numbers up to a given limit

; Declare variables
set i = 1
set limit = 1000 ; Change this value to generate primes up to a different limit
set primes_list = ""

; Loop through numbers up to limit
while i <= limit {

    ; Check if the current number is prime
    set is_prime = 1
    
    ; Loop through potential factors of the number
    set j = 2
    while j <= i / 2 {
        if i % j == 0 {
            set is_prime = 0
            break
        }
        set j = j + 1
    }

    ; Append number to list if it is prime
    if is_prime == 1 {
        set primes_list = primes_list + i + ", "
    }

    ; Increment loop counter
    set i = i + 1
}

; Remove extra comma at the end of the list
set primes_list = primes_list[:len(primes_list) - 2]

; Print the list of prime numbers
`Output: ` + primes_list

Implementation Note: This code snippet uses a nested loop structure to check for prime numbers up to the given limit. It first initializes variables for the loop counters and a string to store the list of primes. Then, it loops through numbers up to the limit and checks each number to see if it is prime by dividing it by potential factors. If the number has no factors besides itself and 1, it is added to the list. After the loop finishes, the extra comma at the end of the list is removed and the final list is printed as output.
