## Function to calculate Fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(n):
    # Checks if input is 0 or 1 and returns respective values
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Initializes a list to store the sequence
        fib_seq = [0, 1]
        # Iterates through numbers from 2 up to the input
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            # Calculates the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
            next_num = fib_seq[i - 1] + fib_seq[i - 2]
            # Appends the calculated number to the list
            fib_seq.append(next_num)
        # Returns the last number in the list, which is the desired Fibonacci number
        return fib_seq[-1]

## Function to find maximum of two numbers
def find_max(a, b):
    # Uses conditional logic to check which number is larger
    if a >= b:
        return a
    else:
        return b

## Main function
def main():
    # Takes user input for the number of Fibonacci numbers to calculate
    n = int(input("Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to calculate: "))

    # Calculates and prints the Fibonacci number
    print("The Fibonacci number at position", n, "is", fibonacci(n))

    # Takes user input for two numbers
    a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculates and prints the maximum of the two input numbers
    print("The maximum of", a, "and", b, "is", find_max(a, b))

# Calls the main function
