; This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
; Inputs: r0 = starting number, r1 = ending number
; Outputs: Fibonacci sequence up to ending number
        ldi r2, 1          ; Load 1 into register r2
        mov r3, r0         ; Move starting number into register r3
        mov r4, r0         ; Move starting number into register r4
        add r4, r2         ; Add 1 to starting number to get second number in sequence
loop:
        cmp r4, r1         ; Compare current number to ending number
        jge done           ; Jump to done if current number is greater than or equal to ending number
        mov r2, r3         ; Move previous number into register r2
        mov r3, r4         ; Move current number into register r3
        add r4, r2         ; Add previous number to current number to get next number in sequence
        j loop             ; Jump back to loop
done:
        mov r0, r3         ; Move final number in sequence into register r0
        halt               ; Stop program execution
