#This is a snippet of code written in the programming language HACK, which is a dialect of PHP developed by Facebook. 

//First, let's declare some variables in HACK
$user_id = 123; //integer variable
$user_name = "John"; //string variable
$is_active = true; //boolean variable

//Next, let's create a function that will retrieve and print user data
function getUserData($id, $name, $active) {
  if($active) { //if user is active
    echo "User #$id: $name is currently active."; //print user info
  } else { //if user is inactive
    echo "User #$id: $name is currently inactive."; //print user info
  }
}

//Now, let's call the function and pass in our variables
getUserData($user_id, $user_name, $is_active);

//Output:
//User #123: John is currently active.
