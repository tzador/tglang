# Welcome to the HACK programming language
# This code snippet is a demo of a complex function
## The function takes in two parameters: x and y
### and returns the sum of their squares
def complex_function(x,y):
   # initialise variables
   sum = 0
   i = 0
   j = 0

   # calculate sum of squares
   while (i <= x):
      while (j <= y):
         sum += (i**2 + j**2)
         j += 1
      i += 1
   
   # print result
   print("The sum of squares is: " + str(sum))
   
# call function with input values
complex_function(5,10)

# OUTPUT:
# The sum of squares is: 894
