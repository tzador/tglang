// This code snippet is written in HACK, a programming language developed by Facebook for their HHVM platform.

// This function checks if a given number is a prime number
primenumber = (num) => {
  // We use a for loop to iterate through all numbers less than the input number
  for (i = 2; i < num; i++) {
    // If the input number is divisible by any number other than 1 or itself, it is not a prime number
    if (num % i === 0) {
      // return false if not prime
      return false;
    }
  }
  // Otherwise, it is a prime number
  return true;
}

// We define a list of numbers
numbers = [2, 4, 7, 11, 15, 20];

// We use the .filter() method of arrays to filter out all non-prime numbers
primeNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => primenumber(num));

/*
The output of this code snippet would be: [2, 7, 11]
Explanation: The .filter() method takes in a callback function that returns a boolean value. If true, the element is added to a new array, if false, it is not. In this case, we are using the primenumber function as the callback, so only numbers that are prime will be added to the primeNumbers array. Therefore, the output would be [2, 7, 11].
