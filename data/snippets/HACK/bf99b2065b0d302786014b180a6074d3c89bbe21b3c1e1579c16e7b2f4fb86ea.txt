\This is a code snippet in HACK

\Declare variables for integers
let x = 5
let y = 10

\Define a function to calculate the product of two integers
function calculateProduct(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}

\Call the function and store the result in a variable
let product = calculateProduct(x, y);

\Print the result to the console
console.log(`The product of ${x} and ${y} is ${product}.`); 

\Output: `The product of 5 and 10 is 50.`
