//This code snippet performs a complex calculation
let a = 10; //Variable a set to 10
let b = 6; //Variable b set to 6
let c = 3; //Variable c set to 3

//Performing the calculation
if (a > b) { //If statement to check if a is greater than b
  c = a - b; //If condition is true, subtract b from a and assign the result to c
} else if (b > a) { //If statement to check if b is greater than a
  c = b - a; //If condition is true, subtract a from b and assign the result to c
} else { //If neither condition is true, set c to 0
  c = 0;
}

//Printing the result
console.log(`The result of the calculation is ${c}.`); //Using template literals to print the result in a string

//Output: The result of the calculation is 4.
