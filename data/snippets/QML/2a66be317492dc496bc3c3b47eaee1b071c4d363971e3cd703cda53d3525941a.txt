/* 
Explanation:
This code snippet uses the QML programming language and imports the QtQuick module with a version of 2.15. It creates a Rectangle item with a width and height of 200 and a color of red. Within this item, there is a child Rectangle item with a relative position and size to the parent item, and a green color. Inside this child item, there is a grandchild Rectangle item that fills the parent item and has a blue color. Finally, there is a sibling Text item with a set position, "Hello World!" text, font size of 20 pixels, and white color, that is centered within the parent Rectangle. This demonstrates the use of child, grandchild, and sibling items, as well as how properties can be inherited and overridden in QML.
