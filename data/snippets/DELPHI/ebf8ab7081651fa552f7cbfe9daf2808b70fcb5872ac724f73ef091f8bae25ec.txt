///This code snippet is a simple calculator in Delphi that takes two numbers
///and performs basic mathematical operations on them.

///Declare the two input variables, num1 and num2, as integers
var
  num1, num2: integer;  

///Declare result variable as a real number, to account for decimal values
var
  result: real;

///Prompt the user to enter the first number
WriteLn('Enter the first number: ');

///Read the input from the user and assign it to the num1 variable
ReadLn(num1);

///Prompt the user to enter the second number
WriteLn('Enter the second number: ');

///Read the input from the user and assign it to the num2 variable
ReadLn(num2);

///Perform addition operation and assign the result to the result variable
result := num1 + num2;

///Print out the result to the user
WriteLn('The addition of ', num1, ' and ', num2, ' is ', result);

///Perform subtraction operation and assign the result to the result variable
result := num1 - num2;

///Print out the result to the user
WriteLn('The subtraction of ', num1, ' and ', num2, ' is ', result);

///Perform multiplication operation and assign the result to the result variable
result := num1 * num2;

///Print out the result to the user
WriteLn('The multiplication of ', num1, ' and ', num2, ' is ', result);

///Perform division operation and assign the result to the result variable
result := num1 / num2;

///Print out the result to the user
WriteLn('The division of ', num1, ' and ', num2, ' is ', result);

///End of program
WriteLn('Press any key to exit');
