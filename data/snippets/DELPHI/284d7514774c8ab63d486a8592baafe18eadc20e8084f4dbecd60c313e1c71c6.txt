//This is a sample procedure in Delphi
//It takes in two integers and returns their sum
procedure AddNumbers(num1 : Integer; num2 : Integer) : Integer;    //The procedure name is AddNumbers and it takes in two parameters of type Integer and returns an Integer
begin    //beginning of the procedure
  Result := num1 + num2;    //the result is calculated by adding the two numbers together and assigning it to the Result variable
end;    //end of the procedure

//To call this procedure, you would use the following syntax:
//var
//  sum : Integer;
//begin
//  sum := AddNumbers(5, 10);    //calling the AddNumbers procedure and passing in the values 5 and 10 as arguments
//  WriteLn('Sum: ', sum);    //printing the value of the sum variable
//end;
