  This is a complex code snippet in DELPHI that calculates the area of a triangle based on the length of its sides.

  Input:
  a, b, c - integers representing the length of the sides of the triangle

  Output:
  area - the calculated area of the triangle
}

program AreaOfTriangle;

var
  a, b, c, s, area: integer;

begin
  //Prompt user for input
  writeln('Enter the length of side a: ');
  readln(a);
  writeln('Enter the length of side b: ');
  readln(b);
  writeln('Enter the length of side c: ');
  readln(c);

  //Calculate semiperimeter
  s := (a + b + c) / 2;

  //Calculate area of triangle using Heron's formula
  area := round(sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)));

  //Print result
  writeln('The area of the triangle is: ', area);
end.
