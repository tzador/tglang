// This code snippet is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number
function Factorial(n: Integer): Integer;
begin
  // Base case when n is equal to 0, return 1
  if n = 0 then
    Result := 1
  // Recursive case if n is greater than 0, return n multiplied by the factorial of n-1
  else

end;

// Sample input of 5
// Output should be the factorial of 5, which is 120
