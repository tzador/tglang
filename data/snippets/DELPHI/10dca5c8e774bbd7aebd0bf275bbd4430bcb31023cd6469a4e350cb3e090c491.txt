{ This code snippet uses a for loop to iterate through a list of integers,
checking each one against a set of conditions and performing various actions
based on the results. }

until (i > 10) do // Loop condition
begin
  if (i mod 2 = 0) and (i < 5) then // Check if i is even and less than 5
    writeln(i, ' is an even number less than 5.')
  else if (i mod 2 = 0) and (i >= 5) then // Check if i is even and greater than or equal to 5
    writeln(i, ' is an even number greater than or equal to 5.')
  else if (i mod 2 <> 0) and (i < 5) then // Check if i is odd and less than 5
    writeln(i, ' is an odd number less than 5.')
  else // If none of the conditions are met, i must be odd and greater than or equal to 5
    writeln(i, ' is an odd number greater than or equal to 5.');
  
  i := i + 1; // Increment i
end;
