// This code snippet is written in DELPHI programming language
// It contains a complex function that calculates the BMI of a person
// BMI stands for Body Mass Index and is a measure of body fat based on height and weight

function CalculateBMI(height, weight: double): double;
// This function takes in two parameters, height and weight, both of type double
// It returns a value of type double, which represents the calculated BMI

begin
  // Create a variable to store the calculated BMI
  var bmi: double;

  // Calculate the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
  bmi := weight / (height * height);

  // Return the calculated BMI
  Result := bmi;
end;

// To use this function, call it with the required parameters and store the returned value in a variable
// For example: var personBMI := CalculateBMI(1.75, 70);
// This will calculate the BMI of a person who is 1.75 meters tall and weighs 70 kg
