{This is a code snippet demonstrating a for loop in Delphi}

program for_loop;

var
i, j: Integer; //initialize variables

begin
  for i := 1 to 10 do //loop through the numbers 1 to 10
  begin
    for j := 1 to i do //loop through numbers from 1 to the current value of i
      Write(j); //print the value of j
    WriteLn; //print a new line
  end;
end.
