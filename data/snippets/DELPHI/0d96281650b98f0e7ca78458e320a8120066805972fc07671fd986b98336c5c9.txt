{ 
  This code snippet is an example of a complex conditional statement in DELPHI.
  It takes in two integer inputs and performs various operations based on their values. 
}

program complex_conditional;

var
  input1, input2, sum, difference, product: Integer;

begin
  { Get input from user }
  WriteLn('Enter first integer: ');
  ReadLn(input1);
  WriteLn('Enter second integer: ');
  ReadLn(input2);

  { Check if both inputs are positive }
  if (input1 > 0) and (input2 > 0) then
  begin
    WriteLn('Both inputs are positive.');

    { Calculate sum }
    sum := input1 + input2;
    WriteLn('The sum of the two inputs is: ', sum);

    { Check if first input is greater than second input }
    if input1 > input2 then
    begin
      WriteLn('The first input is greater than the second input.');

      { Calculate difference }
      difference := input1 - input2;
      WriteLn('The difference between the two inputs is: ', difference);

      { Check if product of inputs is even }
      if (input1 * input2) mod 2 = 0 then
        WriteLn('The product of the inputs is even.')
      else
        WriteLn('The product of the inputs is odd.');
    end
    { If first input is not greater than second input }
    else
    begin
      WriteLn('The first input is not greater than the second input.');

      { Calculate product }
      product := input1 * input2;
      WriteLn('The product of the two inputs is: ', product);
    end;
  end
  { If both inputs are not positive }
  else
  begin
    WriteLn('At least one of the inputs is not positive.');
  end;
end.
