{
   The main program starts here.
   It declares two variables, num and result.
}
var
   num, result: Integer;

{
   This function takes in two parameters, x and y,
   and returns the result of x to the power of y.
}
function power(x, y: Integer): Integer;
begin
   if y = 0 then {Base case: any number raised to 0 is 1}
      result := 1
   else
      {Recursive case: x to the power of y is x multiplied by x to the power of y-1}
      result := x * power(x, y - 1);
end;

begin
   writeln('Enter a number:'); {Display prompt to user}
   readln(num); {Read in the number entered by the user}
   result := power(num, 3); {Assign result to the value returned by the power function with num as the base and 3 as the exponent}
   writeln('The result is: ', result); {Display the result to the user}
end.
