//This procedure uses a QuickSort algorithm to sort a TList data structure.
//It takes in the TList to be sorted, a function for comparing elements, and any additional data needed for the comparison.
//The function recursively partitions the list into sublists based on the pivot element and sorts them until the entire list is sorted.
