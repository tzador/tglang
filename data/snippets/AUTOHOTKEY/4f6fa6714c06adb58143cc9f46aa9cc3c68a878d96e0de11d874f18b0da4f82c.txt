; This code snippet is a complex example of using loops in AUTOHOTKEY

; First, we initialize a variable to store our desired number of loops
loopCount := 10

; Next, we create a counter variable that will keep track of how many loops have been completed
counter := 1

; We then create a while loop that will continue to run until the counter reaches the loop count
while (counter <= loopCount) {

	; Here, we use the loop index command to access the current loop number
	; We also use it as part of a string that will be displayed in the tooltip
	ToolTip, "Loop number: %counter%", A_ScreenWidth/2, A_ScreenHeight/2
	
	; We use a sleep command to pause for 1 second before moving on to the next iteration
	Sleep, 1000
	
	; We increment the counter variable at the end of each iteration
	counter++
}

; Finally, we display a message box to indicate that the loop has ended
MsgBox, Loop has finished running
