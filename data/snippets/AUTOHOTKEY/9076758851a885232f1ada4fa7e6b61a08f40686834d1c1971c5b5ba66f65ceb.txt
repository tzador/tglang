; Define a function that activates a window by searching for its title.
ActivateWindow(Title) {

    if (A_Index % 2 = 0) {
        ; Call the ActivateWindow function and pass in a specific window title as the argument.

    ; Send some keystrokes to the active window.
    Send, %Language% is awesome!

; Display a message box with the final loop count.
MsgBox, The loop has finished running %A_Index% times.
