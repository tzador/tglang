; This code snippet creates a custom function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a given sentence.
; Usage: Call the function "CapitalizeWords", passing in the sentence as a parameter. The function will return the capitalized sentence.

CapitalizeWords(sentence){
    ; Split the sentence into an array of words
    words := StrSplit(sentence, " ")
    
    ; Loop through each word in the array
    for index, word in words {
        ; Get the first letter of the word and capitalize it
        firstLetter := SubStr(word, 1, 1)
        firstLetter := StrUpper(firstLetter)
        
        ; Get the rest of the word and make it lowercase
        restOfWord := SubStr(word, 2)
        restOfWord := StrLower(restOfWord)
        
        ; Combine the first letter and the rest of the word
        capitalizedWord := firstLetter . restOfWord
        
        ; Replace the original word with the capitalized version
        words[index] := capitalizedWord
    }
    
    ; Join the array back into a sentence and return it
    capitalizedSentence := StrJoin(words, " ")
    return capitalizedSentence
}

; Example usage
sentence := "this is a sentence that needs capitalization"
capitalizedSentence := CapitalizeWords(sentence)
MsgBox % capitalizedSentence ; Outputs "This Is A Sentence That Needs Capitalization" in a message box
