; This code is a complex calculator that takes in user input and performs various mathematical operations

; Define variables for user input
InputBox, num1, Please enter the first number,, 400, 300
InputBox, num2, Please enter the second number,, 400, 300

; Convert user input to integers
num1 := StrReplace(num1, ",", "")
num2 := StrReplace(num2, ",", "")

; Perform addition
sum := num1 + num2

; Perform subtraction
difference := num1 - num2

; Perform multiplication
product := num1 * num2

; Perform division
quotient := num1 / num2

; Display the results to the user
MsgBox, % "The sum of " num1 " and " num2 " is " sum "`n" 
    . "The difference between " num1 " and " num2 " is " difference "`n" 
    . "The product of " num1 " and " num2 " is " product "`n" 
    . "The quotient of " num1 " and " num2 " is " quotient

; Define a function for calculating the factorial of a number
Factorial(x) {
    factorial := 1
    loop, % x {
        factorial *= A_Index
    }
    return factorial
}

; Calculate the factorial of num1 and num2
num1_factorial := Factorial(num1)
num2_factorial := Factorial(num2)

; Display the factorial results to the user
MsgBox, % "The factorial of " num1 " is " num1_factorial "`n" 
    . "The factorial of " num2 " is " num2_factorial
