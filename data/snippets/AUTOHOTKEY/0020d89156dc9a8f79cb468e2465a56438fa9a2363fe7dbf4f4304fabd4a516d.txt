; This code snippet is a complex example of using loops and conditional statements in Autohotkey
; This function searches for a specific button on the screen, clicks it, and repeats if needed

while (true) { ; Infinite loop
  buttonLocation := FindButton("Submit") ; Finds the location of the "Submit" button on the screen

  if (buttonLocation = "") { ; Checks if the button was not found
    MsgBox, 0, , Cannot find button. Exiting... ; Shows a message box and exits the loop
    break
  }
  else {
    ClickButton(buttonLocation) ; Clicks the button at the specified location
  }

  Sleep, 3000 ; Waits for 3 seconds to allow the button action to complete

  isNextButton := FindButton("Next") ; Checks if there is a "Next" button on the screen

  if (isNextButton = "") { ; Checks if the "Next" button was not found
    MsgBox, 0, , Cannot find Next button. Finishing search... ; Shows a message box and continues the loop
  }
  else {
    ClickButton(isNextButton) ; Clicks the "Next" button
  }
}

FindButton(buttonName) { ; Function that searches for the specified button on the screen and returns its location
  Loop, 10 { ; Searches for the button 10 times before giving up
    ImageSearch, foundX, foundY, 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth, A_ScreenHeight, %buttonName%.png ; Uses image recognition to find the button on the screen
    if (!ErrorLevel) { ; Checks if the button was found
      return foundX "," foundY ; Returns the location as a string
    }
    Sleep, 500
  }
  return "" ; Returns an empty string if button was not found
}

ClickButton(buttonLocation) { ; Function that moves the mouse to the specified location and clicks
  SplitPath, buttonLocation, buttonX, buttonY ; Splits the location string into X and Y coordinates
  MouseMove, buttonX, buttonY
  Click
}
