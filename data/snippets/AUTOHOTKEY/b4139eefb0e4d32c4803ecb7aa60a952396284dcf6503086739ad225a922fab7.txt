; This is a complex code snippet that uses multiple functions and variables

; First, we define some variables to be used in the code
myName := "John"
age := 25
occupation := "Developer"

; Next, we create a function called 'greet' which takes in a name parameter
greet(name) {
    ; Inside the function, we use the MsgBox function to display a greeting message
    MsgBox % "Hello " . name . "!" . " Welcome to our program."
}

; Now, we call the greet function and pass in our 'myName' variable as an argument
greet(myName)

; Next, we define another function called 'calculate' which takes in two numbers as parameters
calculate(num1, num2) {
    ; Inside the function, we perform some calculations using the numbers passed in
    result := num1 + num2 * 2

    ; We use the MsgBox function again to display the result of the calculation
    MsgBox % "The result of " . num1 . " + " . num2 . " * 2 is " . result
}

; Now, we call the calculate function and pass in our 'age' and 'occupation' variables as arguments
calculate(age, occupation)

; Lastly, we use a loop to iterate through an array of numbers and call the calculate function for each number
numbers := [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Loop, % numbers.MaxIndex() {
    calculate(numbers[A_Index], numbers[A_Index + 1])
}

; Output:
; Hello John! Welcome to our program.
; The result of 25 + Developer * 2 is 75
; The result of 10 + 20 * 2 is 50
; The result of 20 + 30 * 2 is 80
; The result of 30 + 40 * 2 is 110
; The result of 40 + 50 * 2 is 140
