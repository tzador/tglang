; This code snippet uses the AutoHotkey programming language to loop through a list of names, send keystrokes and mouse actions, and wait for certain conditions before continuing.

; Define a list of names
names := ["John", "Alice", "Bob", "Samantha"]

; Loop through the list of names
Loop % names.Length()
{
	; Send a left click to highlight the name
	SendInput, {Click Left}

	; Type out the name
	SendInput, % names[A_Index]

	; Send an enter key to submit the name
	SendInput, {Enter}

	; Wait for the name to appear in the chat
	WinWaitActive, NameChatWindow

	; Move the mouse to the name and click
	MouseGetPos, mouseX, mouseY
	MouseMove, 50, 50
	MouseClickDrag, Left, mouseX, mouseY, 100, 0, 2

	; Wait for the message to be sent
	Sleep 500

	; Send a right click to close the chat
	SendInput, {Click Right}

	; Wait for the chat window to close
	WinWaitClose, NameChatWindow

	; Wait for a random amount of time before continuing to the next name
	Random, waitTime, 500, 2000
	Sleep %waitTime%
}
