^+S:: ; This represents the hotkey CTRL+SHIFT+S

; Get the current date and time in the format of Year-Month-Day_Hour-Minute-Second
FormatTime, timestamp, %A_YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss%

; Save the active document with the timestamp in the filename
FileSave, %A_ScriptFullPath%\%timestamp%.txt

; Notify the user that the file has been saved
TrayTip, File Saved, %A_ScriptName% has been saved with the timestamp %timestamp%.

return ; End of hotkey code
