;This code snippet is a complex custom function in AutoHotkey that calculates and displays the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence.
;Fib(n) returns the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence.
;Parameters:
;  n (integer): the index of the term to be calculated
;Returns:
;  The nth term of the Fibonacci sequence (integer)

Fib(n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return 0 ;base case, return 0 if n is 0 or negative
  }
  else if (n = 1 or n = 2) {
    return 1 ;base case, return 1 if n is 1 or 2
  }
  else {
    n1 := 1 ;variable to store the (n-1)th term in the sequence
    n2 := 1 ;variable to store the (n-2)th term in the sequence
    fib := n1 + n2 ;variable to store the calculated nth term in the sequence
    index := 3 ;index to track the current term being calculated
    while (index < n) {
      n1 := n2 ;replace the (n-1)th term with the (n-2)th term
      n2 := fib ;replace the (n-2)th term with the calculated nth term
      fib := n1 + n2 ;calculate the next term in the sequence
      index++ ;increment the index
    }
    return fib ;return the calculated nth term in the sequence
  }
}

;An example usage of the Fib() function:
InputBox, n, Enter an integer, Please enter an integer to find its corresponding term in the Fibonacci sequence.
MsgBox, The %n%th term in the Fibonacci sequence is %Fib(n)%.

;Output example:
;n = 8
;The 8th term in the Fibonacci sequence is 21.
