; This is a program that allows the user to automatically fill out online forms with their personal information
; To start, we declare the variables for the user's information
Name := "John Smith"
Age := 28
Email := "johnsmith@example.com"
Phone := "555-555-5555"
Address := "123 Main St"

; We create a function that will type out the user's personal information when called
FillForm() {
    Send %Name% ; This line uses the Send command to type out the user's name
    Send {Tab} ; This moves the cursor to the next form field
    Send %Age%
    Send {Tab}
    Send %Email%
    Send {Tab}
    Send %Phone%
    Send {Tab}
    Send %Address%
}

; Next, we create a hotkey that will activate the FillForm function
^!f:: ; This is the hotkey, you can change it to fit your preferences
    FillForm() ; We call the FillForm function when the hotkey is pressed
    Return

; Finally, we add some error handling in case the user needs to stop the program
Esc::
    MsgBox, 4,, Do you want to stop the form filling?
    IfMsgBox Yes
        ExitApp ; This line exits the program
    else
        return ; This line returns to the previous action (i.e. continue filling out forms)
