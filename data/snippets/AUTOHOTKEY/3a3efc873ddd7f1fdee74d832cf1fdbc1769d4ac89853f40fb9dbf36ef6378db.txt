; This code snippet generates a random password

Random, length, 10, 20 ; generates a random number (between 10 and 20) for the length of the password

counter := 1 ; initializes counter variable
password := "" ; initializes password variable

SetFormat, Integer, Hex ; changes format to hexadecimal for generating random characters

Loop %length%
{
    Random, num, 33, 126 ; generates a random number between 33 and 126
    character := Chr(num) ; converts the number to an ASCII character

    If (counter < 3) ; ensures that there are at least 3 lowercase letters in the password
    {
        character := StrLower(character) ; changes character to lowercase
        counter++ ; increments counter variable
    }

    If (mod(counter, 4) = 0) ; ensures that there is at least one uppercase letter in every set of 4 characters
    {
        character := StrUpper(character) ; changes character to uppercase
    }

    If (counter = length) ; ensures that the last character is always a number
    {
        character := Random(0, 9) ; generates a random number between 0 and 9
    }

    password .= character ; adds character to the password
    counter++ ; increments counter variable
}

Tooltip, %password% ; displays the password as a tooltip when hovering over the generated password
Send, ^c ; copies the password to the clipboard
MsgBox, The password has been generated and copied to the clipboard. ; displays a message to the user

SetFormat, Integer, Dec ; resets the format to decimal
