; This is a long and complex code snippet written in AutoHotkey
; Here we declare and set variables, create functions, and perform mathematical operations

; Declare variable `x` and set its initial value to 10
x := 10

; Declare variable `y` and set its initial value to 5
y := 5

; Declare a function called `add` that takes in two parameters `a` and `b`
; and returns the sum of the two parameters
add(a, b) {
    return a + b
}

; Declare a function called `multiply` that takes in two parameters `a` and `b`
; and returns the product of the two parameters
multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b
}

; Print the value of `x` using `MsgBox` function
MsgBox, The value of `x` is %x%

; Call the `add` function and pass in `x` and `y` as arguments
; The returned value is stored in the variable `result`
result := add(x, y)

; Print the returned value of the `add` function using `MsgBox` function
MsgBox, The sum of `x` and `y` is %result%

; Call the `multiply` function and pass in `x` and `y` as arguments
; The returned value is stored in the variable `product`
product := multiply(x, y)

; Print the returned value of the `multiply` function using `MsgBox` function
MsgBox, The product of `x` and `y` is %product%

; This code snippet showcases variable declaration, function creation, and function calling in AutoHotkey.
