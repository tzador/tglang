; This code snippet uses the AutoHotkey programming language to create a hotkey that will only run when Notepad is active. It also checks if a Notepad window is already open and either activates it or opens a new one if it does not exist. The code snippet demonstrates the use of conditionals and functions in AutoHotkey, as well as the syntax for defining hotkeys and sending keyboard commands through the "Send" function.
