; This is a complex code snippet in AUTOHOTKEY

; First, we define some variables
global a := 5
global b := 10

; We create a function with parameters
myFunction(x, y)
{
	; Here we perform some calculations
	global c := x + y
	global d := c * a

	; We use a for loop to print out numbers
	for i, 1, 10
	{
		; We check if the number is divisible by b
		if (i % b = 0)
		{
			; If it is, we print "divisible by b"
			MsgBox % "Number " i " is divisible by " b
		}
		else
		{
			; If not, we print "not divisible by b"
			MsgBox % "Number " i " is not divisible by " b
		}
	}

	; We add the values of c and d and return the result
	return c + d
}

; We call the function with arguments
result := myFunction(2, 3)

; We use a loop to print out the values of result
loop % result
{
	; We check if the value is even or odd
	if (Mod(A_Index, 2) = 0)
	{
		; If it's even, we print "even"
		MsgBox % "Value " A_Index " is even"
	}
	else
	{
		; If it's odd, we print "odd"
		MsgBox % "Value " A_Index " is odd"
	}
}

; This is the end of the code snippet
