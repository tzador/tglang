; This code snippet is a complex loop that checks for specific conditions
; and performs various actions based on the results.

SetEnv, LoopCount, 1 ; sets a variable to keep track of loop count
Loop, %LoopCount%, 10 ; starts a loop from 1 to 10
{
    MsgBox % "Loop " . LoopCount ; displays a message box with the current loop count
    
    If (LoopCount < 5) ; checks if the loop count is less than 5
    {
        MsgBox % "Loop count is less than 5" ; displays a message box with the result
    }
    Else If (LoopCount > 7) ; checks if the loop count is greater than 7
    {
        MsgBox % "Loop count is greater than 7" ; displays a message box with the result
    }
    Else ; if none of the above conditions are met
    {
        Send, {Ctrl down}a{Ctrl up} ; sends a key combination to select all text
        Sleep, 500 ; adds a small delay before moving on to the next action
        Send, ^c ; sends a key combination to copy the selected text
        Sleep, 500 ; adds a small delay before moving on to the next action
        Send, ^v ; sends a key combination to paste the copied text
    }
    
    LoopCount++ ; increments the loop count for the next iteration
}
