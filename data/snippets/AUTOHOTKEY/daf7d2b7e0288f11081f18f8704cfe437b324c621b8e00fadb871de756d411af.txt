; This code snippet is a demonstration of a complex Fibonacci sequence generator

; Define the number of terms to generate
NumTerms := 10

; Initialize variables for the first two terms
a := 0
b := 1

; Use a loop to generate the remaining terms
Loop, % NumTerms-2
{
	; Calculate the next term in the sequence by summing the previous two terms
	c := a + b
	
	; Output the term to the console
	MsgBox % "Term " A_Index+2 ": " c
	
	; Update variables for the next iteration
	a := b
	b := c
}

; Output a message indicating the end of the sequence
MsgBox % "Fibonacci sequence with " NumTerms " terms generated successfully!"
