; This script will loop through a list of websites and open them in separate tabs

; Define an array of websites
websites := ["www.google.com", "www.yahoo.com", "www.bing.com", "www.youtube.com"]

; Set a loop to iterate through the array
Loop, % websites.MaxIndex()
{
    ; Use the current index to select the website to open
    website := websites[A_Index]
    
    ; Use the built-in Run command to open the website in a new tab
    Run, % "chrome.exe " . website
    
    ; Wait for the tab to open before switching to the next one
    Sleep, 1000
    
    ; Use the built-in ControlSend command to switch to the next tab
    ControlSend, % "My Chrome Window", "", "Chrome_TabRight"
    
    ; Add a random delay to simulate human behavior
    Random, delay, 200, 500
    Sleep, % delay
}

; Close the browser window once all tabs have been opened
ControlSend, % "My Chrome Window", "", "Chrome_CloseWindow"
