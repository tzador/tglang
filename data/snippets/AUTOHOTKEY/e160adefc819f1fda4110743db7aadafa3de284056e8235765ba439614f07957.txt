; This code snippet is an example of a function that calculates the factorial of a number
; Function name: factorial
; Input parameter: num (the number to calculate the factorial of)
; Output: fact (the factorial result)

factorial(num) {
  fact := 1 ; initialize factorial result to 1
  Loop, %num% ; loop from 1 to num
  {
    fact *= A_Index ; multiply factorial result by current iteration number
  }
  return fact ; return the factorial result
}

; Example usage:
testNum := 5
MsgBox, %factorial(testNum) ; displays the factorial of 5, which is 120
