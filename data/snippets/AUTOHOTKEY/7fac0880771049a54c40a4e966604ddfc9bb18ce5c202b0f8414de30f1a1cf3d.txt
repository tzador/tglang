; This code snippet creates a function that outputs a randomized sequence of numbers
sequence := "" ; initialize empty string to store sequence

RandomSequence(min, max, size) ; function that takes in minimum and maximum values and size of sequence
{
    SetBatchLines -1 ; set to asynchronous mode for faster execution

    Loop, %size% ; loop %size% times
    {
        Random, num, %min%, %max% ; generate a random number between min and max
        sequence .= num ; append number to sequence
    }
    return sequence ; return the generated sequence
}

; Example usage:
RandomSequence(1, 10, 5) ; generate a sequence of 5 numbers between 1 and 10
