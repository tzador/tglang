;This code snippet is an example of a complex function in AutoHotkey

;Creates a function called "Multi_Loop" which takes two parameters, "num1" and "num2"
Multi_Loop(num1, num2)
{
    ;Declares two local variables, "total" and "i"
    Local total, i
    
    ;Sets the initial value of "total" to 0
    total := 0
    
    ;Creates a loop that runs from the value of "num1" to the value of "num2"
    Loop, %num2% - %num1% + 1
    {
        ;Increments "i" by 1 on each iteration
        i++
        
        ;Adds the value of "i" to "total"
        total := total + i 
        
        ;Prints the current value of "total"
        MsgBox % "Current total: " . total
    }
    
    ;Returns the final value of "total" after the loop is completed
    return total
}

;Calls the "Multi_Loop" function with the values 1 and 5 and stores the result in the variable "final_result"
final_result := Multi_Loop(1, 5) 

;Prints out the final result
MsgBox % "Final result: " . final_result
