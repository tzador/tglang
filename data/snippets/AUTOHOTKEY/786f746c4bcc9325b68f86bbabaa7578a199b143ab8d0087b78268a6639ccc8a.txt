Loop, %length% ; loops through the length using the following code
{
    Random, randomChar, 33, 126 ; sets a random number between 33 and 126
    asciiChar := Chr(randomChar) ; converts the number to ASCII character
    password := password . asciiChar ; appends the character to the password string
}
SendInput %password% ; sends the password to the active window

; Variables:
; length - stores the length of the password
; randomChar - stores the random number generated for each character
; asciiChar - stores the ASCII character equivalent of randomChar
; password - stores the final password string

; Commands:
