; This program creates a countdown timer and performs actions when it reaches zero.
; It includes a GUI for user input and uses a loop to continuously check the time.

; Set the default countdown time in seconds
SetCountdownTime := 600

; Initialize GUI for user input
Gui, Add, Text, , Enter Countdown Time (in minutes):

GuiSubmit:
  CountdownTime := CountdownInput * 60
Return

; Create a loop to continuously check the time and perform actions when it reaches zero.
Loop
{
  ; Convert CountdownTime to minutes and seconds
  CountdownMin := Floor(CountdownTime / 60)
  CountdownSec := Mod(CountdownTime, 60)

  ; Update the GUI
  GuiControl,, CountdownInput, % CountdownMin "m" % CountdownSec "s"

  ; Check if countdown has reached zero
  If CountdownTime = 0
  {
    ; Perform desired actions here
    MsgBox, Countdown timer has reached zero!
    Break ; Exit the loop
  }

  ; Reduce countdown time by 1 second
