; This is a code snippet in the programming language AutoHotkey
; It demonstrates a complex function for editing text documents automatically

; Declare variables for storing the current line and the edited line
CurrentLine := ""
EditedLine := ""

; Function to remove any commas in the current line
RemoveCommas() {
    ; Loop through each character in the current line
    Loop, Parse, CurrentLine {
        ; Check if the current character is a comma
        If InStr(A_LoopField, ",") {
            ; Remove the comma and store the edited line in a new variable
            EditedLine := StrReplace(CurrentLine, A_LoopField, "")
        } Else {
            ; Keep the character as is and add it to the edited line
            EditedLine := EditedLine . A_LoopField
        }
    }
    ; Update the current line with the edited line
    CurrentLine := EditedLine
}

; Function to combine all words in the current line and store them in alphabetical order
CombineWords() {
    ; Declare an array to store individual words from the current line
    Words := []
    ; Loop through each word in the current line
    Loop, Parse, CurrentLine, % " " {
        ; Add the word to the array
        Words.Push(A_LoopField)
    }
    ; Sort the array in alphabetical order
    Words.Sort()
    ; Loop through the sorted array
    Loop, % Words.MaxIndex() {
        ; Combine the words in alphabetical order and add them to the edited line
        EditedLine := EditedLine . %Words[A_Index%]
    }
    ; Update the current line with the edited line
    CurrentLine := EditedLine
}

; Main code that executes the functions
!+p:: ; Hotkey for running the code
    ; Get the current line from the clipboard
    CurrentLine := Clipboard
    ; Run the RemoveCommas function
    %RemoveCommas%
    ; Run the CombineWords function
    %CombineWords%
    ; Update the clipboard with the edited line
    Clipboard := CurrentLine
    ; Display a success message
    MsgBox, Text successfully edited and copied to clipboard!
