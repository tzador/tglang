;This code snippet is a custom function that calculates the factorial of a given number
Factorial(number){
    if number <= 1 ;base case, return 1 if number is 1 or 0
        return 1
    else
        return number * Factorial(number - 1) ;recursive case, multiply number by the factorial of number-1
}

;Example of calling the function with a given number and storing the result in a variable
num := 5
result := Factorial(num)

;Print the result
MsgBox, % "Factorial of " . num . " is " . result
