#IfWinActive, Notepad ; This line sets a conditional expression, so the code only runs when Notepad is active

!+c:: ; This line creates a hotkey, Alt + Shift + C, to trigger the following actions
Send, Hello World! ; This command sends the string "Hello World!" to the active window
ClipWait,1 ; This command pauses the script until the clipboard contains data or 1 second has passed
ClipBoard := RegExReplace(ClipBoard, "\W") ; This command uses regular expressions to remove all non-word characters from the clipboard
Send, {Raw}%ClipBoard% ; This command uses the value of the modified clipboard as dynamic input

Else IfWinActive, Chrome ; This line is an alternative conditional expression, so the code only runs when Google Chrome is active

!+c:: ; This hotkey is the same as the first one, but the actions are different
Send ^a ; This command simulates pressing Ctrl + A to select all text
Send, {Raw}%ClipBoard% ; This command uses the value of the clipboard as dynamic input
Send ^v ; This command simulates pressing Ctrl + V to paste the modified text

Return ; This line ends the hotkey and makes the script ready for the next one

#IfWinActive ; This line disables the conditional expression, so the code can run for any active window
