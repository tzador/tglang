; This code snippet is a function that takes in two strings and concatenates them together with a hyphen in between 
; The concatenate function
concatenate(string1, string2) 
{
    ; First we remove any existing hyphens in the strings
    string1 := StrReplace(string1, "-", "")
    string2 := StrReplace(string2, "-", "")
    
    ; Then we add the hyphen in between the strings
    combined_string := string1 . "-" . string2
    
    ; Output the combined string
    MsgBox % "The two strings combined with a hyphen between them are: " . combined_string
}

; Example usage
concatenate("Hello", "World") ; Output: "The two strings combined with a hyphen between them are: Hello-World"
