;This code snippet is an example of a hotkey that opens a specified folder
;when the user presses a certain key combination.

;First, we define the key combination that we want to use as the hotkey.
^!f:: ;The caret (^) symbol represents the control key and the exclamation (!) symbol represents the alt key, creating a hotkey of ctrl+alt+f.

;Next, we set the path of the folder that we want to open.
FolderPath := "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Folder" ;Replace this with the path of the folder you want to open.

;Then, we check if the folder exists.
if (FileExist(FolderPath)){
    ;If the folder exists, we use the Run command to open it.
    Run, %FolderPath%
}
else{
    ;If the folder does not exist, we display a message to the user.
    MsgBox, The specified folder does not exist!
}

;Finally, we add a tooltip that will be displayed when the user hovers over the hotkey
ToolTip, Press ctrl+alt+f to open the specified folder. ;Replace this with a relevant message.

;End of code snippet.
