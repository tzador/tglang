;This code snippet creates a custom function that calculates the factorial of a given number
Factorial(number)
{
  if (number <= 1) ;if number is 1 or less, return 1
    return 1

  factorial := 1 ;initialize factorial variable with 1

  ;loop through numbers starting from 2 and multiply with factorial variable
  Loop, % number - 1
    factorial *= A_Index

  return factorial ;return the calculated factorial value
}

;example usage
factorial_of_4 := Factorial(4) ;calculate the factorial of 4
MsgBox % "Factorial of 4 is: " . factorial_of_4 ;display the result in a message box
