;Declare the function with 1 parameter
WordCount(string){
    
    ;Initialize the count to 0
    count := 0
    
    ;Loop through each character in the string
    Loop, parse, string, `s
    
        ;Check if the character is a word

            count++
    
    ;Return the count
    return count
}

;Example usage
