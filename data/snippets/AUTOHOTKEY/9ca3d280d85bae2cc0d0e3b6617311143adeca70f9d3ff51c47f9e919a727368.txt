; This code snippet uses AutoHotkey to automate a task
; It generates a random password and saves it in a text file

#NoEnv					; Prevents accidental use of uninitialized variables
#SingleInstance Force	; Forces the script to have only one instance

; Set the lengths of the password and the number of characters
password_length := 12
num_characters := 62 	; 26 letters + 26 capital letters + 10 numbers

; Create an array with all possible characters
characters := "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"

; Generate a random password using a loop
Loop %password_length%
{
	; Get a random index from the array
	random_index := Random(0, num_characters-1)

	; Append a random character to the password
	password .= SubStr(characters, random_index+1, 1)
}

; Save the password to a text file
File := "password.txt"
FileDelete, %File% 			; Deletes the file if it already exists
FileAppend, %password%, %File%

; Notify the user that the password has been generated and saved
TrayTip, Password Generated, The password has been saved in %File%, 2, 1

; End the script
