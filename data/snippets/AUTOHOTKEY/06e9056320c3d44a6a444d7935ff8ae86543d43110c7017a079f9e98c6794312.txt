/*
This code snippet is a complex script written in the programming language AutoHotkey.
It allows the user to open and close multiple applications with a single key press.
This is achieved by using the keyboard hook functionality of AutoHotkey.

The script begins by setting some global variables and hotkeys that will be used throughout the code.
These variables include the list of applications to be opened or closed, the key that will trigger the action,
and the key combination that will be used to exit the script.

Once the variables are set, the main function is defined. This function will be executed when the hotkey is pressed.
Inside the function, a loop is used to go through the list of applications and either open or close them,
depending on their current state.

To check the current state of the application, the WinExist function is used.
If the application is already open, the function returns its ID, which can then be used to close it using the WinClose function.
If the application is not open, the function returns 0 and the application is opened using the Run command.

To make sure the script exits cleanly, a function is defined to handle the key combination set earlier.
When this key combination is pressed, the script will break out of the loop and exit.

Finally, after all the functions and hotkeys are defined, the key combination function is called to start the keyboard hook.
This ensures that the script will listen for the hotkey and exit command at all times,
even if the user switches to a different window or application.
