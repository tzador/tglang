; This code snippet demonstrates a complex function that checks the current weather conditions and adjusts the screen brightness accordingly

; Set and store current weather conditions data
VarSet, Weather, 2 ; Possible values: 1 = sunny, 2 = cloudy, 3 = rainy
VarSet, Hour, ErrorLevel ; Integer value of current hour

; Compare current hour with sunrise/sunset hours for day/night mode
if (Weather = 1) { ; Check if it's sunny
  if (Hour < 6 or Hour > 18) ; Check if it's before 6am or after 6pm
    SetScreenBrightness(50) ; Set brightness to 50%
  else
    SetScreenBrightness(80) ; Set brightness to 80%
}
else if (Weather = 2) { ; Check if it's cloudy
  if (Hour < 7 or Hour > 19) ; Check if it's before 7am or after 7pm
    SetScreenBrightness(40) ; Set brightness to 40%
  else
    SetScreenBrightness(70) ; Set brightness to 70%
}
else if (Weather = 3) { ; Check if it's rainy
  if (Hour < 8 or Hour > 20) ; Check if it's before 8am or after 8pm
    SetScreenBrightness(30) ; Set brightness to 30%
  else
    SetScreenBrightness(60) ; Set brightness to 60%
}

; Function to set screen brightness based on percentage
; Usage: SetScreenBrightness(percentage)
SetScreenBrightness(percentage) {
  PixelGetColor, PixelColor, 0, 0 ; Get the color of the top-left pixel on the screen
  PixelSetColor(Color, 255*percentage/100, 0, 0) ; Set the color to a percentage of red based on the brightness percentage
  CoordMode, Pixel, Screen ; Set coordinates to screen
  PixelSearch, X, Y, 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth-1, A_ScreenHeight-1, PixelColor, 0, Fast ; Search for a pixel of the same color on the screen
  DllCall("gdi32\SetDeviceGammaRamp", "ptr", 0, "short", 1, "ushort", 0, "ushort", 255*percentage/100, "ushort", 0) ; Set the screen brightness based on the percentage
  Sleep 100 ; Delay for some time to prevent flickering
  DllCall("gdi32\SetDeviceGammaRamp", "ptr", 0, "short", 1, "ushort", 0, "ushort", 255, "ushort", 0) ; Reset the screen brightness
