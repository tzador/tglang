; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number

; Define the input parameter
InputBox, n, Factorial, Enter a number to calculate its factorial,, 200, 120

; Define the variables and set the initial value for the result
result := 1
i := 1

; Loop through the numbers from 1 to n
Loop, %n%
{
    ; Multiply the current result with the current number
    result := result * i

    ; Increment i by 1 to move to the next number
    i++
}

; Display the result in a message box
MsgBox, % n "factorial is" result

; This code snippet can be modified to include error handling and larger number calculations. It can also be converted to a function for reusable code.
