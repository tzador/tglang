; This code snippet is a function that takes in a string and returns the count of unique characters present in it
; It utilizes the built-in Object() function to store unique characters and their count
; The `=` operator is used to assign values to the keys of the object
; A `for` loop is used to loop through each character in the string
; The `in` operator is used to check if the character is already present in the object
; If not, it is added as a new key with a value of 1
; If it is present, the value is incremented by 1
; The final count is returned at the end of the function
UniqueCharCount(string) {
    uniqueChars := Object()
    for i, character in StrSplit(string, "") {
        if character in uniqueChars {
            uniqueChars[character] := uniqueChars[character] + 1
        } else {
            uniqueChars[character] := 1
        }
    }
    return uniqueChars.Length()
}
; Example usage
input := "Hello World!"
count := UniqueCharCount(input)
MsgBox % "The string " . input . " has " . count . " unique characters.
