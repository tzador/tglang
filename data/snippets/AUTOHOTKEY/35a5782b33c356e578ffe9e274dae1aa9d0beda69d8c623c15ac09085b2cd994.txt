; This code snippet generates random passwords with specific requirements
Random, length, 10, 15 ; sets the password length to a random number between 10 and 15
Loop, %length% ; loops through the number of characters in the password
{
    Random, char, 33, 126 ; sets a random number between 33 and 126 which corresponds to printable ASCII characters
    password .= Chr(char) ; appends the ASCII character to the password string
}
password := RegExReplace(password, "[ -~]", "") ; removes any special or non-printable characters from the password
Random, uppercase, 0, %length% ; randomly chooses a number of characters to be capitalized
Loop, %uppercase% ; loops through the number of uppercase characters
{
    Random, position, 1, %length% ; chooses a random position in the password string
    CharUpper, password, position ; capitalizes the character at the chosen position
}
Random, numbers, 0, %length% ; randomly chooses a number of characters to be numbers
Loop, %numbers% ; loops through the number of numbers
{
    Random, position, 1, %length% ; chooses a random position in the password string
    Random, number, 0, 9 ; chooses a random number between 0 and 9
    password := RegExReplace(password, StrReplace(position, ".", "\.") . "$", number . "") ; replaces the character at the chosen position with the random number
}
; Output the generated password
MsgBox, The generated password is %password%
