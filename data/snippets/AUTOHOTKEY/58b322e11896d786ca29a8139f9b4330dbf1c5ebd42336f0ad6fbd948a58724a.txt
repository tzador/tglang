; This code snippet demonstrates a complex AutoHotkey script that combines mouse and keyboard inputs
#NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey versions.
#SingleInstance force ; Ensures a single instance of the script is running at a time.
#InstallKeybdHook ; Required to capture certain key combinations.

SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.
