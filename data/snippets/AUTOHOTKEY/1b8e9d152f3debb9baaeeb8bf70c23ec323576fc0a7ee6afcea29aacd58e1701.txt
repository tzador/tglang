; This code snippet demonstrates a loop that generates a Fibonacci sequence with a specified number of terms.

; Set the number of terms in the sequence
num_terms := 10

; Create an array to store the sequence
fib_sequence := []

; Set the first two terms as 0 and 1 respectively
fib_sequence[1] := 0
fib_sequence[2] := 1

; Loop to generate the remaining terms
Loop % (num_terms-2) {
    ; Get the last two terms
    term_1 := fib_sequence[loop_index]
    term_2 := fib_sequence[loop_index+1]
    
    ; Calculate the next term
    next_term := term_1 + term_2
    
    ; Add the next term to the array
    fib_sequence.Push(next_term)
}

; Print the sequence
MsgBox % "Fibonacci Sequence with " . num_terms . " terms: " . fib_sequence.Join(", ")
