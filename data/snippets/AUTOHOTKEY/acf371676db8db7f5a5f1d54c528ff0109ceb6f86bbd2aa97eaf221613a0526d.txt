; This code snippet will create a program that automatically types out a specific text string

; Set the hotkey to trigger the program
^!t::
{
    ; Set a variable with the desired text string
    message = Hello, this is an automated message!

    ; Loop through each character in the message
    Loop, parse, message
    {
        ; Get the current character
        character := A_LoopField
        
        ; Check if the character is a space
        If (character = " ")
        {
            ; Send the space character using the send command
            Send, {Space}
        }
        ; If the character is not a space
        Else
        {
            ; Use the send command to type out the character
            Send, %character%
        }

        ; Add a short delay after each character is typed
        Sleep, 100
    }

    ; Send an enter keystroke to send the message
    Send, {Enter}
}
