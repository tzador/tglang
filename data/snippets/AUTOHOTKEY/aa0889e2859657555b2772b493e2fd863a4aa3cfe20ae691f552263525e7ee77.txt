; This program uses a function to iterate through a list of numbers and perform a calculation on each one.

; Create a function called "calculate" that takes in two parameters: "num" and "operation"
calculate(num, operation) {
    ; If the operation is addition, add 5 to the number
    if (operation = "addition") {
        num := num + 5
    }
    ; If the operation is subtraction, subtract 3 from the number
    else if (operation = "subtraction") {
        num := num - 3
    }
    ; If the operation is multiplication, multiply the number by 2
    else if (operation = "multiplication") {
        num := num * 2
    }
    ; If the operation is division, divide the number by 4
    else if (operation = "division") {
        num := num / 4
    }
    ; Return the final calculated value
    return num
}

; Create a list of numbers to perform the calculations on
numbers := [10, 21, 34, 45, 56]

; Loop through each number in the list
for num in numbers {
    ; Call the "calculate" function with the current number and the operation "multiplication"
    calculated_num := calculate(num, "multiplication")
    ; Output the result
    MsgBox % "The calculated number is: " . calculated_num
}
