;This code uses loops and functions to shuffle a deck of cards

;First, create the list of cards
suits := ["clubs", "hearts", "spades", "diamonds"]
values := ["ace", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten", "jack", "queen", "king"]
cards := []

;Create a function to generate a new card
newCard() {
    ;Choose a random suit and value from the lists
    suit := suits[Random(1, 4)]
    value := values[Random(1, 13)]

    ;Add the new card to the deck
    cards.Push(value . " of " . suit)
}

;Use a loop to generate the full deck of 52 cards
Loop 52 {
    newCard()
}

;Define a function to shuffle the deck
shuffle() {
    ;Create a temporary deck to store the shuffled cards
    temp := []

    ;While there are still cards in the deck
    While (cards.Length() > 0) {
        ;Choose a random card from the deck and move it to the temporary deck
        randomCard := cards.Pop()
        temp.Push(randomCard)
    }

    ;Set the shuffled deck as the original deck
    cards := temp
}

;Call the shuffle function to randomize the order of the cards
shuffle()

;Print out the shuffled deck
for each, card in cards {
    MsgBox % card
}
