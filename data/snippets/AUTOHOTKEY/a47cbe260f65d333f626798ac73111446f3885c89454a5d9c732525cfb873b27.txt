; This code snippet showcases a complex function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence.

; Set input variable to number of terms in sequence
input := 10
; Initialize variables for current and previous values in sequence
current := 1
previous := 0
; Initialize variable for storing calculated sequence
sequence := ""

; Loop through input number of times
Loop % input {
	; Add current value to sequence
	sequence .= current . ", "
	; Calculate next value in sequence by adding current and previous values
	next := current + previous
	; Shift values, current becomes previous and next becomes current
	previous := current
	current := next
}

; Remove extra comma and space from end of sequence
sequence := SubStr(sequence, 1, -2)

; Print out calculated sequence
MsgBox, % "The Fibonacci sequence for " . input . " terms is: " . sequence
