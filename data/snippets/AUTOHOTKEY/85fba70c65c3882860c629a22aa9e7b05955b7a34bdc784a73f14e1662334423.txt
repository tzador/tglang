; This code snippet is a function that creates a hotkey for toggling a selected group of window titles
#NoEnv ; Avoids checking the existence of variables
#SingleInstance Force ; Ensures only one instance of the script is running

; ======= GLOBAL VARIABLES =======
Global groupHotkey := "Ctrl+Shift+T" ; The hotkey combination to toggle the group
Global groupActive := 0 ; Keeps track of whether the group is active or not
Global groupTitles := ["Notepad","Calculator","Chrome"] ; List of window titles in the group

; ======= MAIN FUNCTION =======
GroupToggle() ; Hotkey function for toggling the group
{
  if(groupActive = 0) ; If the group is currently inactive
  {
    Loop, % groupTitles.Length() ; Loops through each window title in the group
    {
      WinShow, %groupTitles[A_Index]% ; Show the window based on its title
    }
    groupActive := 1 ; Set groupActive to 1 to indicate the group is now active
  }
  else ; If the group is currently active
  {
    Loop, % groupTitles.Length() ; Loops through each window title in the group
    {
      WinHide, %groupTitles[A_Index]% ; Hide the window based on its title
    }
    groupActive := 0 ; Set groupActive to 0 to indicate the group is now inactive
