; This code snippet demonstrates the use of functions and loops in AutoHotkey
; This function prints the squares of numbers from 1 to 10
; It takes in a number as a parameter, squares it and prints the result
; The loop goes from 1 to 10, using the parameter to determine the limit
LoopSquares(number) {
  Loop, 10
  {
    result := number ** 2  ; the '**' operator is used for exponentiation in AutoHotkey
    MsgBox % number " squared is " result
    number++
  }
}

; This function calculates the factorial of a given number
; It uses recursion to calculate the factorial
Factorial(number) {
  if (number == 0)  ; base case for recursion
    return 1
  else
    return number * Factorial(number - 1)  ; recursive call to calculate factorial
}

; Here we call the functions and pass in the necessary parameters
; The result of the functions will be printed in a message box
LoopSquares(5)
MsgBox The factorial of 5 is % Factorial(5)
