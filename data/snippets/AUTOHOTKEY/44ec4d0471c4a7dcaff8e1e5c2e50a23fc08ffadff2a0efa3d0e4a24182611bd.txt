; This code snippet is a complex script in AutoHotkey that automates repetitive tasks on a Windows computer.
; It will open a specific application, switch to a specific window, and perform a series of actions on that window.
; To use this script, you will need to modify the variables and commands to fit your specific needs.

; Set title of the window to be targeted 
SetTitleMatchMode, 2
WindowTitle := "Application Name"

; Open the application
Run, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Application\app.exe"

; Wait for the window to become active
WinWaitActive, %WindowTitle%

; Create a loop to perform the actions multiple times
Loop, 5
{
	; Press the "Tab" key to navigate to a specific field
	Send {Tab}
	Sleep, 500
	
	; Type in a specific value into the field
	SendText := "12345"
	Send, %SendText%
	Sleep, 500
	
	; Press the "Enter" key to submit the information
	Send {Enter}
	Sleep, 1000
	
	; Check if the window is still active, if not, exit the loop
	IfWinNotActive, %WindowTitle%
	{
		Break
	}
}
