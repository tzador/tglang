; This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.
; It uses a for loop and conditional statements to handle edge cases.

factorial(n) {
    ; Initialize the output variable that will store the factorial result.
    output := 1

    ; Handle edge cases where n is either 0 or 1.
    if (n = 0 or n = 1) {
        return output
    }

    ; Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 2 to n.
    ; Update the output variable at each iteration by multiplying it with the current number.
    for i, currentNumber in 2..n {
        output := output * currentNumber
    }

    ; Return the final factorial result.
    return output
}

; Example usage of the factorial function.
; Prints out the factorial of 5, which is 120.
MsgBox % factorial(5)
