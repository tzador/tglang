; This code snippet executes a complex automated task
#NoEnv ; Ensures no environment variables are inherited
#SingleInstance, force ; Forces script to be single instance

; Declaring variables to be used in script
global data1 := "" ; Empty string variable
global data2 := {} ; Empty object variable
global count := 0 ; Variable to keep track of loop iterations

Loop, Read, input.txt ; Reads input file line by line
{
    count += 1 ; Incrementing loop counter
    StringReplace, currentLine, A_LoopReadLine, `r`n, , All ; Removes line breaks from current line

    ; Checks if current line is blank
    if (StrLen(currentLine) = 0) 
    {
        continue ; Skips this line and moves to next iteration of loop
    }

    ; Parses current line to extract necessary data
    StringSplit, dataList, currentLine, ; ; Splits current line using semicolon as delimiter
    extractedData1 := dataList[1] ; Extracts first data element
    extractedData2 := dataList[2] ; Extracts second data element

    ; Adds extracted data to global object variable
