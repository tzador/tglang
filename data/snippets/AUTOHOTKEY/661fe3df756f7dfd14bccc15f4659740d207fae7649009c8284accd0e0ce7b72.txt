; This code snippet maps the percent sign symbol to a key combination
; that will automatically hold down the Ctrl key, paste the clipboard contents,
; and release the Ctrl key.

; To use, simply type the following: %; followed by the text to paste

; We use the AutoHotkey syntax of "hotstring" to trigger this code snippet
; Every time the user types %; AutoHotkey will look for the text to the left
; and replace it with the code to the right

::   ; Marks the beginning of the hotstring

%    ; The text to the left of the hotstring that will trigger the code

;{CtrlDown} ; Simulates holding down the Ctrl key

{v}  ; Simulates pressing the V key, which is the paste shortcut

{CtrlUp}   ; Simulates releasing the Ctrl key

%;   ; The text to the right of the hotstring, which is what will be replaced
