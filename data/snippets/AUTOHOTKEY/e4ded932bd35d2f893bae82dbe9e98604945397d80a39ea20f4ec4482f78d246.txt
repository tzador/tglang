###### This code snippet uses AutoHotKey to create a script that automates key presses for a specific task

#NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
SendMode Input  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.

#IfWinActive, ahk_exe notepad.exe ; Only perform the following actions if Notepad is the active window

; Create a function that will type "Hello World!" when called
WriteText()
{
    Random, delay, 50, 200 ; Generate a random delay between 50 and 200 milliseconds
    Sleep, %delay% ; Pause for the generated delay
    Send, Hello World! ; Simulate typing "Hello World!" into the active window
}

; Define a hotkey that will trigger the WriteText function when pressed
^+t::WriteText() ; Pressing Ctrl + Shift + T will call the WriteText function

#IfWinActive ; Deactivate the window-specific hotkey

; Create a loop that will repeat the WriteText function 10 times
Loop, 10
{
    WriteText() ; Call the WriteText function
    Sleep, 1000 ; Pause for 1 second before repeating the loop
}

; Create a hotkey that will exit the script when pressed
Esc::ExitApp ; Pressing Escape will exit the script

#IfWinActive ; Deactivate the window-specific hotkey
