#IfWinActive, Notepad ;defines that the following rules apply only when Notepad is the active window
!^z:: ;defines a hotkey that will be triggered by pressing Alt+Ctrl+Z
Send, Here is a long and complex code snippet that will be output by the hotkey. It includes various functions and loops.

;This section of the code will set a variable to the current date and time and will then convert it into a different format
currentDateTime := FormatTime, currentDateTime, YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm

;This loop will iterate through a list of numbers and perform different actions
Loop, 10
{
    ;This section will check if the current number is divisible by 3 and will output a message if it is
    If (A_Index % 3 = 0)
    {
        MsgBox, The number %A_Index% is divisible by 3.
    }
    ;This section will check if the current number is less than 5 and will perform a function if it is
    If (A_Index < 5)
    {
        ;This function will output a random value between 1 and 10
        Random, num, 1, 10
        ;This section will add the random value to the current index and output a message
        indexResult := A_Index + num
        MsgBox, The result of %A_Index% + %num% is %indexResult%.
    }
}

;This section of the code will get the current cursor position and display it in a message box
CoordMode, Mouse, Screen
MouseGetPos, mouseX, mouseY
MsgBox, The current cursor position is %mouseX%, %mouseY%.

;This function will take in two strings and concatenate them
string1 := "I like"
string2 := "programming."
concatenated := string1 . " " . string2
MsgBox, %concatenated%

;This section of the code will copy the concatenated string to the clipboard
clipboard := %concatenated%

return ;ends the hotkey definition
#IfWinActive ;ends the conditional window definition
