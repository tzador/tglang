; This code snippet uses AutoHotkey to create a complex function 
; that utilizes loops and conditionals.

#SingleInstance, Force ; forces the script to only run one instance at a time

; Function to loop through all folders in a given directory and create a
; text file containing the file names in each folder.
FolderLoop(directory)
{
   Loop, Files, %directory%\*.* ; loops through all files in the given directory
   {
      folder_list = %A_LoopFileName% ; stores the current folder name in a variable
      If !InStr(folder_list, ".") ; checks if the current item is a folder
      {
         FileAppend, %folder_list%, *directory_list.txt ; appends the folder name to the text file
         Loop, Files, %directory%\%folder_list%\*.* ; loops through all files in the current folder
         {
            file_name = %A_LoopFileName% ; stores the current file name in a variable
            If InStr(file_name, ".txt") ; checks if the current file is a text file
            {
               file_path = %directory%\%folder_list%\%file_name% ; creates the full path of the file
               FileRead, file_contents, %file_path% ; reads the contents of the file
               If InStr(file_contents, "complex") ; checks if the file contains the word "complex"
               {
                  FileAppend, %file_name%`,, complex_files.txt ; appends the file name to the text file
               }
            }
         }

; Creates a GUI with a button that executes the FolderLoop function
Gui, Add, Button, x10 y10 w100 h30, Run FolderLoop
Gui, Show ; shows the GUI

ButtonRunFolderLoop:
Gui, Submit ; submits any changes made in the GUI
FolderLoop(directory) ; calls the FolderLoop function
return

GuiClose:
ExitApp ; closes the script when the GUI is closed
