/* This code snippet is for an AutoHotkey script that automates repetitive tasks. It ensures that the script stays persistent, single instance, and matches the title of the active window when executing commands.
It also sets the batch lines to be unlimited and disables environment variables which can cause conflicts. Finally, it increases the maximum number of hotkeys per interval to 200. */
