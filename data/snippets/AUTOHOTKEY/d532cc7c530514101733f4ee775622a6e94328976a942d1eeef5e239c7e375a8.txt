// This code snippet creates a script in AutoHotkey that allows the user to save any URL to the Wayback Machine's archive by pressing "Ctrl + f" on their keyboard while the browser window is active. It first checks if the active window contains "Untitled-" in its title, and if so, it executes the following code. It copies the URL from the address bar, checks if it is a valid URL, and then appends it to the Wayback Machine's archive URL. It then uses the HTTPget function to access the archive and stores the response in a variable. If there are no errors in the request, it extracts the direct link from the response headers and pastes it into the browser's address bar. The script then exits after waiting for the archived page to load. If any errors occur, it displays an error message.
