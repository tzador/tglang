; This is a code snippet that creates a random number generator using AutoHotkey.

; Define variables
Random, randomNumber, 1, 1000 ; This line generates a random number between 1 and 1000 and assigns it to the variable randomNumber.

; Create GUI window
Gui, Add, Text, , Please enter a number between 1 and 1000:
Gui, Add, Edit, vUserInput ; This line adds an editable field for user input and assigns it to the variable UserInput.
Gui, Add, Button, gGenerate, Generate ; This line adds a Generate button that will trigger the Generate label when clicked.
Gui, Show ; This line displays the GUI window.

Generate: ; Label for the Generate button
Gui, Submit, NoHide ; This line submits the user input from the GUI window without hiding it.
UserInput := UserInput + 0 ; This line converts the user input from a string to a number.

; Check for valid input
if UserInput > 0 && UserInput <= 1000 ; This line checks if the user input is between 1 and 1000.
{
    Loop % UserInput % ; This line starts a loop that will run UserInput number of times.
    {
        Random, randomNumber, 1, 1000 ; This line generates a random number between 1 and 1000.
        ; Note: If you want to generate a different range of random numbers, simply change the values
        ; in the parentheses after the "Random" command.
        MsgBox, %randomNumber% ; This line displays the randomly generated number in a message box.
    }
    ExitApp ; This line exits the script.
}
else ; If user input is not between 1 and 1000, this line displays an error message.
    MsgBox, Invalid input. Please try again.
return ; This line ends the label and returns to the GUI window.

; This code snippet can be customized to generate random numbers with different ranges or for different purposes.
; Feel free to experiment and add your own code to make it even more complex and advanced.
