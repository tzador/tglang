; Define a function named "CalculateSum" with two parameters: "num1" and "num2"
CalculateSum(num1, num2){

    ; Add the two numbers and store the result in the "total" variable
    total := num1 + num2

    ; Return the calculated sum
    return total
}

; Create an object named "myObject" with two properties: "name" and "age"
myObject := {name: "John", age: 30}

; Use a for loop to iterate through the "myObject" and print the values of the properties
for key, value in myObject{

    ; Check if the current property is "age"
    if key = "age"{
        ; Print the value of the "age" property
        MsgBox % "The age of " . myObject.name . " is " . value
    }
    else{
        ; Print the value of the "name" property
        MsgBox % "The name is " . value
    }
}

; Call the "CalculateSum" function with the values 10 and 20 and store the result in the "result" variable
result := CalculateSum(10, 20)

; Print the result using a message box
MsgBox % "The result of the calculation is " . result

; Output:
