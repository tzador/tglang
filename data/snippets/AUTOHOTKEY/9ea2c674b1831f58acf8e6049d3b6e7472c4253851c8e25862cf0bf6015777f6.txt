; This code snippet uses Autohotkey to create a shortcut for opening a specific folder and making changes to its files
; Pressing Ctrl + Shift + O will open the folder and add the current date to all the files' names.

#IfWinActive, ahk_exe explorer.exe ; Setting the condition for the hotkey to only work when Windows Explorer is active
^+o:: ; Defines the hotkey as Ctrl + Shift + O
{
  FormatTime, currentDate, A_Sec, yyyyMMdd ; Gets the current date in the format of YearMonthDay
  folderPath := "C:\Users\Username\Documents\Example Folder" ; Sets the folder path to be opened
  Loop, Files, %folderPath%\*.* ; Loops through all the files in the folder
  {
    fileName := A_LoopFileName ; Gets the current file name
    FileMove, %folderPath%\%fileName%, %folderPath%\%currentDate%_%fileName% ; Renames the file by adding the current date in front of its name
  }
  Explorer.exe %folderPath% ; Opens the folder in Windows Explorer
  return
}
#IfWinActive ; Sets the condition back to any active window after the hotkey is used.
