; Prompt user to enter length of password
InputBox, length, Enter Password Length, Please enter the length of the password (between 8 to 20 characters).,, 300, 150

; Generate a random number to determine the number of characters for each type of character
Random, num_upper, 2, 4 ; between 2 to 4 uppercase letters
Random, num_lower, 2, 6 ; between 2 to 6 lowercase letters
Random, num_number, 2, 4 ; between 2 to 4 numbers
Random, num_special, 2, 4 ; between 2 to 4 special characters (i.e. symbols)

; Calculate the remaining length for random characters
rem_length := length - (num_upper + num_lower + num_number + num_special)

; Generate random characters according to the distribution determined above
Loop, %num_upper%
{
    random_char_upper := Chr(Random(65, 90)) ; random uppercase letter according to ASCII table
    password .= random_char_upper
}

Loop, %num_lower%
{

    password .= random_char_lower
}

Loop, %num_number%
{

    password .= random_char_number
}

Loop, %num_special%
{

; Generate remaining random characters
Loop, %rem_length%
{
    random_char := Chr(Random(33, 126)) ; random character according to ASCII table

}

; Shuffle the password to ensure randomness
password_shuffle := StrPut(password, "UTF-8")

; Print the generated password
MsgBox, 0x40000, Generated Password, Your password is:`n`n%password%, 10

; Copy the generated password to clipboard
Clipboard := password

; Some comments for the user's understanding
; The above loops generate random characters based on the given distribution
; The final password is printed in a message box and copied to clipboard for convenience
