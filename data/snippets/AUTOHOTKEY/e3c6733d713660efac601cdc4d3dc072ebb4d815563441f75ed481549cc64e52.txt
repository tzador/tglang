; This is a complex code snippet in AUTOHOTKEY that utilizes loops and functions to perform tasks

; Define a function named "add" that takes in two parameters, "num1" and "num2"
add(num1, num2) {
    ; Initialize a variable named "sum" with a value of 0
    sum := 0
    ; Use a loop to iterate "num2" times
    Loop, %num2% {
        ; Increase "sum" by the value of "num1" in each iteration
        sum := sum + num1
    }
    ; Return the value of "sum"
    return sum
}

; Define a function named "multiply" that takes in two parameters, "num1" and "num2"
multiply(num1, num2) {
    ; Initialize a variable named "result" with a value of 0
    result := 0
    ; Use a loop to iterate "num2" times
    Loop, %num2% {
        ; Call the "add" function to add "num1" with the value of "result" in each iteration
        result := add(num1, result)
    }
    ; Return the value of "result"
    return result
}

; Call the "multiply" function with the parameters 5 and 3 and store the returned value in a variable named "final_result"
final_result := multiply(5, 3)

; Print the value of "final_result" to the console
MsgBox % final_result
