; This code snippet uses variables, loops and conditional statements to generate a list of Fibonacci numbers in descending order

; Initialize variables
a := 1 ; first number in the sequence
b := 1 ; second number in the sequence
iterator := 10 ; number of iterations to perform

; Perform iterations
Loop, % iterator
{
    if(b > a) ; check if second number is greater than first number
    {
        temp := a ; store first number in temporary variable
        a := b ; assign second number to first number
        b := temp ; assign first number (from temporary variable) to second number
    }
    else ; if second number is smaller than or equal to first number
    {
        b := a + b ; generate next number in sequence by adding first and second number
        a := b - a ; assign first number to previous value of second number
    }
    ; Print Fibonacci number in descending order
    fibNum := b
    Loop, % A_Index
    {
        fibNum-- ; decrement fibNum by 1 with each iteration
    }
    MsgBox, % fibNum
}
