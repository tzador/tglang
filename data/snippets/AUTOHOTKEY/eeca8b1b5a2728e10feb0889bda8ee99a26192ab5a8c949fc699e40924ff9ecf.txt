; This code snippet calculates the average of a list of numbers
; and adds it to a new list
; Define the list of numbers
numbers := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

; Define a variable to store the sum of the numbers
sum := 0

; Loop through the numbers and add them to the sum
for num in numbers {
    sum += num
}

; Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of numbers in the list
avg := sum / numbers.Length()

; Define a new list to store the average
avg_list := []

; Add the average to the new list
avg_list.push(avg)

; Output the new list with the average added
msgbox % "The new list with the average added is: " avg_list
