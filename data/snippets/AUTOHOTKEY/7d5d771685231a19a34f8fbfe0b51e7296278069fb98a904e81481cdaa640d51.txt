; This code snippet uses AutoHotkey to create a complex hotkey that emulates mouse movements.
; It allows the user to hold down a specified modifier key (such as ctrl or alt) while moving the mouse in a certain direction to perform a desired action. 

; Change the name of the hotkey if desired by changing "^[Right]" to something else. 
^[Right]::
; Save the current cursor position into variables.
oldX := A_CursorX
oldY := A_CursorY

; Define the amount of pixels to move the mouse.
distance := 200
; Calculate new X and Y values based on the direction and distance.
newX := oldX + distance
newY := oldY

; Move the cursor to the new position and click the right mouse button. 
MouseMove, %newX%, %newY%
Click, Right, , 0, 0, 0

; After the right click is performed, move the cursor back to the original position.
MouseMove, %oldX%, %oldY%

; Repeat the same process for other directions and actions if desired.
