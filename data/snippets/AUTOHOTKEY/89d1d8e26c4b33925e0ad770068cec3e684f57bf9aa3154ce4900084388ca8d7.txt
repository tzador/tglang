; This code snippet demonstrates a complex function in AUTOHOTKEY

; Create a function called "ComplexFunction"
ComplexFunction() {

  ; Create a variable "count" and set it to 0
  count := 0

  ; Use a while loop to iterate until count reaches 10
  while (count <= 10) {

    ; Add 1 to count
    count := count + 1

    ; Call another function "SubFunction" with count as the parameter
    SubFunction(count)
  }

  ; Display a message box with the final value of count
  MsgBox, The final value of count is %count%
}

; Create another function called "SubFunction" that takes in a parameter "num"
SubFunction(num) {

  ; Multiply the parameter "num" by 2
  num := num * 2

  ; Display a message box with the new value of "num"
  MsgBox, The value of num is now %num%
}

; Call the "ComplexFunction" to run the code
ComplexFunction()

; Output:
; The value of num is now 2
; The value of num is now 4
; The value of num is now 6
; The value of num is now 8
; The value of num is now 10
; The value of num is now 12
; The value of num is now 14
; The value of num is now 16
; The value of num is now 18
; The value of num is now 20
; The final value of count is 10
