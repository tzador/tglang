; This code snippet will generate a random alphanumeric string of length 10
; First, we initialize an array containing all alphanumeric characters
characters := ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z","a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z","0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"]
; Next, we define a function to generate the random alphanumeric string
generateString() {
  ; First, we initialize an empty string to hold the generated string
  string := ""
  ; Then, we use a loop to iterate over 10 characters using the length of the characters array
  Loop, 10 {
    ; We use the Random function to generate a random number between 1 and the length of the characters array
    random := Random(1, characters.Length())
    ; We append the character at the random index to the string variable
    string .= characters[random]
  }
  ; Finally, we return the generated string
  return string
}
; Lastly, we call the generateString function and assign the returned value to a variable
randomString := generateString()
; We can now use the variable 'randomString' to access the generated random alphanumeric string of length 10.
; The result will be a different string every time the code is run.
