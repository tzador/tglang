; This snippet demonstrates the use of conditional statements, functions, loops, and built-in variables in AutoHotkey

; Define a function that takes in two parameters and multiplies them
Multiply(x, y)
{
    return x*y
}

; Define a variable with the current day of the week
CurrentDay := A_YYYYMMDD 	; e.g. 20201023

; Define an array of days of the week
Weekdays := ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]

; Use a conditional statement to check if today is a weekday
If (CurrentDay > 6) { 		; Sunday has the highest value in the array
  MsgBox, Today is a weekend day!
} Else {
  MsgBox, Today is a weekday!
}

; Use a loop to display every weekday from the array
Loop % Weekdays.Length()
{
  MsgBox, % "Weekday " . A_Index ": " . Weekdays[A_Index]
}

; Define a variable with a sentence
Sentence := "This sentence has 8 words"

; Use a built-in variable to count the number of words in the sentence
MsgBox, The sentence has % A_WordCount(Sentence) " words"

; Use a built-in function to replace a word in the sentence
NewSentence := StrReplace(Sentence, "8", "nine")

; Display the updated sentence
MsgBox, % "Updated sentence: " . NewSentence

; Use a loop to generate and display a list of even numbers from 1 to 10
Loop 10 {
  If (A_Index % 2 = 0) {
    MsgBox, % "Even number: " . A_Index
  }
}

; Use a jump statement to skip to a specific iteration in the loop
Loop 10 {
  If (A_Index = 5) {
    Continue 	; Skips to the next iteration
  }
  MsgBox, % "Number: " . A_Index
}
