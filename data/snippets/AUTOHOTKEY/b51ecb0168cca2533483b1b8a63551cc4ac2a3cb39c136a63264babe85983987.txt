; This code snippet demonstrates a complex function in AutoHotkey
; that counts the number of words in a string and outputs the result

CountWords(input) {
    SetTitleMatchMode, 2 ; Makes the window title "exact match" (including spaces)
    WinGetClass, inputClass, A ; Gets the window class name of active window
    originalClip := ClipboardAll ; Stores the current contents of the clipboard
    Clipboard := input ; Sets the input string as the clipboard contents
    Send, ^a ; Selects all text in the active window
    Send, ^c ; Copies the text to the clipboard
    WinActivate, %inputClass% ; Activates the window with the original class name
    Send, % Clipboard ; Sends the clipboard contents to the active window
    Send, {End} ; Moves the cursor to the end of the text
    Send, {Ctrl Down} ; Presses the Ctrl key
    Send, {Left} ; Moves the cursor to the left, deselecting the last word
    Send, {Ctrl Up} ; Releases the Ctrl key
    Sleep 500 ; Waits for the text to be deselected
    Send, ^c ; Copies the updated text to the clipboard
    numWords := StrSplit(Clipboard, " " ).Count() ; Splits the text by spaces and counts the number of elements
    Clipboard := originalClip ; Restores the original clipboard contents
    Return numWords ; Outputs the number of words
}
