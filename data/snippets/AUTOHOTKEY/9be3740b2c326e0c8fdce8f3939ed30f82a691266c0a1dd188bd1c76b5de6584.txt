; The code prompts the user to enter a slot number for their desired product
; The user's selection is then checked against the available products in the machine
; If the slot is valid and the product is available, the user is prompted to confirm their purchase
; If confirmed, the product is dispensed and the inventory is updated accordingly
; If not confirmed, the user can choose to exit or make another selection
; This code also includes error handling for invalid inputs and insufficient inventory
