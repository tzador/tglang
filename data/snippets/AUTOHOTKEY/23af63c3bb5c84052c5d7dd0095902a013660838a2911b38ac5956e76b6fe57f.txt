	OutputVar := 1 ;Initial value for factorial
	Loop, % number ;Loop for multiplying all numbers from 1 to the given number
		OutputVar *= A_Index
	Return OutputVar ;Return the calculated factorial
}

;Array to store the numbers whose factorial will be calculated
numbers := [5, 10, 15, 20]

;Function to print out the factorial of each number in the array
PrintFactorial(numbers) {
	Loop, % numbers.Length() ;Loop through each element in the array
	{
		number := numbers[A_Index] ;Get the number from the array at current index
		factorial := Factorial(number) ;Calculate the factorial using the Factorial function
		MsgBox, % "Factorial of " . number . " is " . factorial ;Print out the result

;Call the PrintFactorial function to print out the factorial for each number in the array
PrintFactorial(numbers)

;Output:
;Factorial of 5 is 120
;Factorial of 10 is 3628800
;Factorial of 15 is 1307674368000
;Factorial of 20 is 2432902008176640000
