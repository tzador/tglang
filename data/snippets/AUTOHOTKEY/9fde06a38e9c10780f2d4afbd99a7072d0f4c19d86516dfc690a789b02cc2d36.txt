; -- Multi-key Press Example --

; The following is a script that allows you to combine two keys to trigger a third key press.
; In this example, pressing Ctrl and Shift will send the letter X keystroke.

; Create a hotkey with the first two keys to trigger the combined key press.
^+::
; Set the timeout for the next key press to 1 second.
SetKeyDelay, 1000
; Send the third key press (letter X) while the first two keys are being held down.
SendInput, {x down}
; Wait for a short delay to ensure the third key press is registered.
Sleep, 50
; Release the third key.
SendInput, {x up}
; End the hotkey.
return

; -- Variable use example --

; The following is a script that utilizes variables to store and manipulate data.
; In this example, pressing Alt+Home will increase the stored variable's value by 1 and display a message with the updated value.

; Define the stored variable and set its initial value.
storedVar := 0
!Home::
; Increase the variable by 1.
storedVar++
; Display a message with the updated value.
MsgBox, The stored variable's value is now %storedVar%.
; End the hotkey.
return

; -- Looping example --

; The following is a script that utilizes a loop to repeat a set of actions multiple times.
; In this example, pressing Ctrl+Shift+F12 will repeat the keystrokes "hello" and "world" five times each.

^+F12::
; Set the number of times to repeat the loop.
loopCount := 5
; Start the loop.
Loop, %loopCount%
{
	; Send the string "hello".
	SendInput, hello
	; Wait for a short delay.
	Sleep, 50
	; Send the string "world".
	SendInput, world
	; Wait for a short delay.
	Sleep, 50
}
; End the hotkey.
