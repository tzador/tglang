; This is a complex code snippet written in AutoHotkey
; It generates a random password and copies it to the clipboard
; Start by defining a string of characters to use in the password
str := "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*()"

; Define the length of the password, here we choose 10 characters
len := 10

; Create an empty string to store the password
password := ""

; Use a loop to randomly select characters from the string and add them to the password
loop, %len%
{
	; Generate a random number between 1 and the length of the string
	random, index, 1, StrLen(str)
	; Use the random number as an index to select a character from the string
	char := SubStr(str, index, 1)
	; Add the character to the password string
	password := password . char
}

; Show the generated password in a message box
MsgBox, The generated password is: %password%

; Copy the password to the clipboard
clipboard := password

; Notify the user that the password has been copied to the clipboard
MsgBox, Password copied to clipboard!

; End of code snippet.
