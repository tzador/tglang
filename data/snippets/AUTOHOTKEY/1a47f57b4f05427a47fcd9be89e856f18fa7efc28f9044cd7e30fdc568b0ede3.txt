; This code snippet checks if a key is currently being held down and changes
; the action based on how long it has been held down.

; Define variable for tracking keypress time
KeyPressTime := 0

; Define variable for holding currently pressed key
CurrentKey := ""

; Set hotkey to track keypress
~*a::
    ; Store current timestamp in variable
    StartTime := A_TickCount

    ; Store currently pressed key in variable
    CurrentKey := "a"

    ; Start loop to continuously check keypress time
    Loop
    {
        ; Check if currently pressed key is still held down
        If GetKeyState(CurrentKey, "P") {
            ; Calculate the time key has been held down
            KeyPressTime := A_TickCount - StartTime

            ; Check if key has been held down for longer than 1 second
            If (KeyPressTime >= 1000) {
                ; Perform action if key has been held down for 1 second or more
                SendInput, {Enter}
                
                ; Reset keypress time and currently pressed key
                KeyPressTime := 0
                CurrentKey := ""
            }
        } 
        ; If key is no longer held down, break out of loop
        Else {
            Break
        }
        ; Sleep for a short period of time before checking keypress time again
        Sleep, 10
