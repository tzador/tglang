; Example code snippet using AutoHotkey
; Description: This code snippet demonstrates how to use variables and loops in AutoHotkey
; By: John Doe

; Define a variable using the := operator
myVar := "Hello world!"

; Print the variable to the console using the MsgBox function
MsgBox %myVar%

; Use a for loop to iterate through a list of numbers and add them to another variable
sum := 0
for i, number in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
{
    sum += number
}

; Print the sum to the console
MsgBox %sum%

; Use a while loop to check if the sum variable is less than 100 and add 10 to it until it reaches 100
while(sum < 100)
{
    sum += 10
}

; Print the new sum to the console
MsgBox %sum%

; Use an if statement to check if the sum is greater than 100 and print a message if it is
if(sum > 100)
{
    MsgBox The sum is larger than 100!
}

; Use a switch statement to check the value of the sum variable and perform different actions based on the value
switch sum
{
    ; If the sum is between 0 and 50, print a message
    Case value < 50:
    {
        MsgBox The sum is less than 50!
    }
    
    ; If the sum is between 50 and 100, print a different message
    Case value < 100:
    {
        MsgBox The sum is between 50 and 100!
    }
    
    ; If the sum is exactly 100, print a third message
    Case value == 100:
    {
        MsgBox The sum is exactly 100!
    }
    
    ; If none of the above cases match, print a default message
    Default
    {
        MsgBox The sum is larger than 100!
    }
}

; Use a function to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial(num)
{
    if(num == 0)
        return 1
    else
        return num * factorial(num-1)
}

; Call the function and print the result
MsgBox %factorial(4)%

; Set a hotkey using the # symbol for the Windows key, ^ for the control key, and ! for the alt key
#^!k::
{
    ; When the Hotkey Win+Ctrl+Alt+K is pressed, display a message box
    MsgBox The hotkey was pressed!
    return
}
