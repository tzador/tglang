;; This code snippet demonstrates a complex function in AutoHotkey that calculates the area of a rectangle

#SingleInstance, Force  ; Ensures only one instance of this script is running
SetTitleMatchMode, 2 ; Set window title matching mode to allow partial title matching

;; Define function to calculate area of rectangle
CalculateRectangleArea(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
    ;; Calculate length and width of rectangle
    length := Abs(x2 - x1)
    width := Abs(y2 - y1)

    ;; Calculate area
    area := length * width

    ;; Return calculated area
    return area
}

;; Define variable for window title of calculator program
windowTitle := "Calculator"

;; Loop to continuously check for calculator window
while (1) {
    ;; Get active window title
    activeTitle := WinGetTitle("A")

    ;; Check if calculator program is currently active
    if (activeTitle = windowTitle) {
        ;; Get coordinates of calculator window
        WinGetPos, windowX, windowY, windowWidth, windowHeight, %activeTitle%
        
        ;; Calculate coordinates of rectangle within calculator window
        rectX1 := windowX + (windowWidth * 0.25)
        rectY1 := windowY + (windowHeight * 0.25)
        rectX2 := windowX + (windowWidth * 0.75)
        rectY2 := windowY + (windowHeight * 0.75)

        ;; Call CalculateRectangleArea function and pass in rectangle coordinates
        result := CalculateRectangleArea(rectX1, rectY1, rectX2, rectY2)

        ;; Print result to console
        MsgBox, The area of the rectangle is %result% square units.
        
        ;; Exit loop since calculation is done
        break
    }
    ;; Wait for 1 second before checking again
    Sleep, 1000
