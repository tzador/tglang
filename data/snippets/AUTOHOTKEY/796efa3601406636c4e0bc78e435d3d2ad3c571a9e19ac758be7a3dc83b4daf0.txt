; This code snippet defines a custom hotkey that modifies the text currently selected in Notepad.
; First, it checks if Notepad is the active window.
; Then, it sets the Match Mode to 2 to allow for partial window title matches.
; Next, it defines the custom hotkey as Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C.
; As the hotkey is triggered, the code first clears the clipboard.
; Then, it sends the Ctrl+C hotkey to copy the selected text.
; The clipboard is modified using a regular expression to replace all instances of "1" with "l".
; The modified text is then pasted using the Ctrl+V hotkey.
; The cursor is moved to the end of the pasted text using the End key.
; Then, the first five characters of the pasted text are highlighted by sending the Left key five times.
; These characters are then cut using the Ctrl+Shift+X hotkey.
; The cursor is moved to the beginning of the pasted text using the Home key.
; Then, the last five characters of the pasted text are highlighted by sending the Right key five times.
; The modified text is then pasted before the highlighted characters using the Ctrl+Shift+V hotkey.
; Finally, the highlighted characters are deleted using the Backspace key.
