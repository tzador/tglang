; This script opens a program and simulates clicks and keystrokes to perform a specific task
Run, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Example Program.exe"
WinWait, Example Program
WinActivate, Example Program
MouseClick, left, 100, 100
Sleep, 500
Send, {Tab}{Enter}
; In this section, we create a loop to repeat the task multiple times
loop, 5 
{
    MouseClick, left, 200, 200
    Sleep, 500
    Send, {Tab}{Enter}
}

; This section captures the current time and waits for a specific image to appear on the screen
image := "C:\images\example_image.png"
ImageSearch, foundX, foundY, 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth, A_ScreenHeight, *30 %image%
startTime := A_TickCount
while (foundX = 0) or (A_TickCount-startTime < 10000)
{
    ImageSearch, foundX, foundY, 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth, A_ScreenHeight, *30 %image%
    Sleep, 500
}

; Once the image is found, the loop is terminated and the program continues
if (foundX != 0)
{
    MouseClick, left, foundX, foundY
    Sleep, 500
    Send, {Tab}{Enter}
}

; Finally, we close the program and exit the script
