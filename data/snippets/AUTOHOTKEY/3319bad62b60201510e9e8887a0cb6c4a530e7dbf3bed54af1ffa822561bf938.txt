; This is a code snippet in AUTOHOTKEY
; It contains multiple functions and variables used for automating tasks
; The purpose of this code is to simplify repetitive actions on a computer

#NoEnv  ; prevent automatic creation of variables/commands
#SingleInstance, Force  ; ensure only one instance of script is running

; Variables for file and folder paths
rootDir := "C:\Users\Username\Documents\" 
scriptDir := A_ScriptDir
logFile := scriptDir . "\log.txt"

        MsgBox, There was an error creating the folder.
        return false
