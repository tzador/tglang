;This is a long and complex code snippet written in AutoHotkey
;It includes various functions and conditional statements

;Create a blank variable to hold a random number
RandomVar =

;Use a loop to generate 10 random numbers between 1 and 100
Loop, 10
{
    ;Use the Random function to generate a random number between 1 and 100
    Random, RandNum, 1, 100
    
    ;Add the current random number to the RandomVar variable
    RandomVar = %RandomVar%%RandNum%
}

;Check if the value of RandomVar is greater than 500
if (RandomVar > 500)
{
    ;If it is, display a message stating "RandomVar is greater than 500"
    MsgBox, RandomVar is greater than 500
}
else
{
    ;If it is not, display a message stating "RandomVar is less than or equal to 500"
    MsgBox, RandomVar is less than or equal to 500
}

;Create a function to check if a number is divisible by 3
DivisibleBy3(number)
{
    ;Use the Mod function to check if the number is divisible by 3
    ModResult := Mod(number, 3)
    if (ModResult = 0)
    {
        ;If it is, return true
        return true
    }
    else
    {
        ;If it is not, return false
        return false
    }
}

;Use a loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 100
Loop, 100
{
    ;Check if the current number is divisible by 3 by calling the DivisibleBy3 function
    if (DivisibleBy3(A_Index))
    {
        ;If it is, display a message stating "Number A_Index is divisible by 3"
        MsgBox, Number %A_Index% is divisible by 3
    }
}

;Define a class called "Vehicle"
class Vehicle
{
    ;Add a constructor function that takes in two parameters, make and model
    __New(make, model)
    {
        ;Assign the make and model to variables within the class
        this.Make := make
        this.Model := model
    }
    
    ;Add a method to the class called "RevEngine"
    RevEngine()
    {
        ;Display a message stating "The [make] [model] revs its engine"
        MsgBox, The %this.Make% %this.Model% revs its engine
    }
}

;Create an instance of the Vehicle class with make "Ford" and model "Mustang"
myCar := new Vehicle("Ford", "Mustang")

;Call the RevEngine method on the myCar instance
myCar.RevEngine()

;Create a dictionary to store car models and their respective top speeds
carModels := {"Ford Mustang": "155 mph", "Chevrolet Camaro": "165 mph", "Dodge Challenger": "170 mph"}

;Loop through the dictionary
for model, topSpeed in carModels
{
    ;Display a message stating "The [model] has a top speed of [top speed]"
    MsgBox, The %model% has a top speed of %topSpeed%
}
