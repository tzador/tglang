; This code snippet uses Hotkey modifiers to create a complex function
; The function will move the mouse cursor to specific coordinates when triggered by a hotkey combination
; This is useful for automating repetitive clicking tasks in a specific location
^q:: ; This hotkey combination uses the "Ctrl" modifier and the "q" key
    MouseMove, 500, 500, 50, R ; This command moves the mouse cursor to the coordinates (500, 500) with a speed of 50 pixels per second and relative to the current position
    Sleep, 200 ; This pauses the script for 200 milliseconds
    MouseClick, left ; This command clicks the left mouse button
    Sleep, 200 ; This pauses the script for 200 milliseconds
    MouseClick, right ; This command clicks the right mouse button
    Sleep, 200 ; This pauses the script for 200 milliseconds
    MouseClick, middle ; This command clicks the middle mouse button
    Sleep, 200 ; This pauses the script for 200 milliseconds
    MouseClick, 3 ; This command clicks the third (wheel) mouse button
    Sleep, 200 ; This pauses the script for 200 milliseconds
    MouseMove, -500, -500, 50, R ; This command moves the mouse cursor to the coordinates (-500, -500) with a speed of 50 pixels per second and relative to the current position
    Send, Hello World! ; This command sends the text "Hello World!" to the active window
    Return ; This is the end of the function and it returns control to the script

; You can add additional hotkey combinations that call this function for different coordinates and actions
^w:: ; This hotkey combination uses the "Ctrl" modifier and the "w" key
    MouseMove, 1000, 1000, 50, R ; This command moves the mouse cursor to the coordinates (1000, 1000) with a speed of 50 pixels per second and relative to the current position
    Sleep, 200 ; This pauses the script for 200 milliseconds
    MouseClick, left ; This command clicks the left mouse button
    Sleep, 200 ; This pauses the script for 200 milliseconds
    MouseClick, right ; This command clicks the right mouse button
    Sleep, 200 ; This pauses the script for 200 milliseconds
    MouseMove, -1000, -1000, 50, R ; This command moves the mouse cursor to the coordinates (-1000, -1000) with a speed of 50 pixels per second and relative to the current position
    Send, Goodbye World! ; This command sends the text "Goodbye World!" to the active window
    Return ; This is the end of the function and it returns control to the script
