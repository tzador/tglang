; This code snippet is written in AutoHotkey, a free, open-source scripting language for Windows.
; It is used for automating repetitive tasks and creating hotkeys for shortcuts.

; The following code snippet creates a simple auto-clicker that clicks at a specified interval.
; It requires the A_MouseFix library, which can be found on the AutoHotkey forums.

Finally, "running" is a boolean flag to control the loop. */
