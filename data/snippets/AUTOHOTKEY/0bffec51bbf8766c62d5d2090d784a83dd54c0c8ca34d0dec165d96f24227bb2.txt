;This code snippet is a short script for automating key presses and mouse actions in Autohotkey
;It uses a combination of hotkeys and mouse clicks to simulate a drag and drop action

;First, we define our hotkeys that will trigger the automation
^!d:: ; Ctrl+Alt+D will activate our script
    MouseClick, left, 500, 500, 2, 30 ; A double left mouse click at coordinates (500, 500) with a speed of 30
    KeyWait, LButton, D ; Waits for the left mouse button to be held down
    CoordMode, Mouse, Screen ; Sets the coordinates mode to screen
    MouseMove, 520, 520, 0, R ; Moves the mouse to coordinates (520, 520) relative to its current position
    MouseClickDrag, left, 520, 520, 500, 400, 30 ; Simulates a drag from (520, 520) to (500, 400) with a speed of 30
    KeyWait, LButton, U ; Waits for the left mouse button to be released
    ExitApp ; Exits the script

;Next, we define our tool tip that will display when the script is activated
ToolTip, Press and hold left click to drag the mouse, 500, 500 ; Displays "Press and hold left click to drag the mouse" at coordinates (500, 500)

;Finally, we define our exit hotkey that will allow us to close the script
Esc::ExitApp ; Pressing the Esc key will close the script

;This concludes our code snippet for automating drag and drop actions in Autohotkey
;For more advanced automation, you can add in conditional statements and loops to perform multiple actions
