; This is a complex code snippet in AutoHotkey
; It involves file manipulation, loops, and hotkeys

#SingleInstance force ; Ensures only one instance of script is running

file := FileOpen("C:\Users\Username\Desktop\test.txt", "w+") ; Opens test.txt file in write mode

Loop, 10 ; Loops 10 times
{
    file.WriteLine("This is line number " A_Index) ; Writes a line with the current loop index
}

file.Close() ; Closes the file

; Setting a hotkey
#^!s:: ; hotkey Win+Ctrl+Alt+S
{
    file := FileOpen("C:\Users\Username\Desktop\test.txt") ; Opens test.txt file in read mode
    Loop, Read, file ; Loop through each line in the file
    {
        If (A_Index = 5) ; If the current line is the 5th line
        {
            msgbox % "The 5th line says: " . A_LoopReadLine ; Display a message with the content of the 5th line
            file := "" ; Clear file variable to prevent re-reading the file
            break ; Exit the loop
        }
    }
    file.Close() ; Close the file
}

; Main loop
Loop
{
    Sleep 100 ; Wait 100ms before repeating the loop
}
