;This code snippet uses loops and arrays to create a password generator
PasswordLength := 12 ;This is the desired length of the password
PossibleCharacters := "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*()" ;This is the pool of characters to choose from
Password := "" ;This will store the password that is generated
SetTimer, GeneratePassword, 50 ;Set a timer to start the password generation process every 50 milliseconds
GeneratePassword:
Random, RandomIndex, 1, %StrLen(PossibleCharacters%) ;Choose a random index in the PossibleCharacters string
RandomChar := SubStr(PossibleCharacters, RandomIndex, 1) ;Retrieve the character at that index
Password := Password . RandomChar ;Append the character to the Password string
If StrLen(Password) = PasswordLength ;Check if the desired password length has been reached
    SetTimer, GeneratePassword, Off ;If yes, turn off the timer
ClipBoard := Password ;Copy the generated password to the clipboard
SendInput, {Ctrl down}v{Ctrl up} ;Paste the password wherever the cursor is
Return
