; This code snippet demonstrates a complex and long AutoHotkey script

; Define a variable to store the current date and time in MM-dd-yyyy_HH-mm-ss format
currentDateTime := FormatTime, currentDate, MM-dd-yyyy_HH-mm-ss, A_Now

; Create a new folder with the formatted current date and time as its name 
FileCreateDir, %currentDate%

; Loop through all the files in the current directory
Loop, Files, *.txt

; Use the FileMove command to move each text file to the newly created folder
FileMove, %A_LoopFileFullPath%, %currentDate%

; Define a function to replace all instances of a specific string in a file
ReplaceStringInFile(strFile, strOld, strNew)
{
    ; Read the contents of the file into a variable
    FileRead, strContent, %strFile%

    ; Use the StrReplace command to replace all instances of the old string with the new string
    StrReplace, updatedContent, strContent, %strOld%, %strNew%

    ; Overwrite the file with the updated content
    FileDelete, %strFile%
    FileAppend, %updatedContent%, %strFile%
}

; Use the ReplaceStringInFile function to replace all instances of "Hello" with "Hi" in all text files in the current directory
ReplaceStringInFile(A_LoopFileFullPath, "Hello", "Hi")

; Show a message box to let the user know the script has finished running
MsgBox, The script has finished running. Check the newly created folder for your files.

; Disable the caps lock key
SetCapsLockState, AlwaysOff

; Wait for 5 minutes before exiting the script
Sleep, 300000
ExitApp
