; This is a code snippet to create a function in AutoHotkey that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion
; ===============================

; Declare a function named "factorial" that takes in one parameter, "num"
factorial(num) {
    ; Check if the value of "num" is equal to 1
    if (num = 1) {
        ; If it is, return 1
        return 1
    } else {
        ; If it isn't, multiply "num" by the factorial of "num-1" by calling the "factorial" function again (recursion)
        return num * factorial(num-1)
    }
}
; Declare a variable named "inputNum" and set its value to 5 (can be changed to any other number)
inputNum = 5
; Call the "factorial" function with the value of "inputNum" as the argument and store the result in "factorialResult"
factorialResult = factorial(inputNum)
; Display the result using the built-in "MsgBox" function
MsgBox, The factorial of %inputNum% is %factorialResult%
