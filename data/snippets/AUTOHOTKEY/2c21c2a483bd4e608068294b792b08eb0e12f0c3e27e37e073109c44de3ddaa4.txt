; This code snippet generates a random password of 12 characters
Loop, 12
{
  ; generates a random number between 33 and 126, inclusive
  Random, num, 33, 126 
  ; converts the number to its character representation
  char := Chr(num)
  ; checks if the character is a number
  If num >= 48 and num <= 57 
    ; replaces the number with a random uppercase letter
    char := Chr(Random(65, 90))
  ; checks if the character is a lowercase letter
  else if num >= 97 and num <= 122 
    ; replaces the letter with a random symbol
    char := Chr(Random(33, 47)) 

  ; appends the character to the password string
  password .= char 
}

; prints the generated password to the console
MsgBox % password
