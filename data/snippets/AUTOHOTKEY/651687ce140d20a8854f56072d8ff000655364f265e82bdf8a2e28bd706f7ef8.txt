; This is a complex code snippet in AUTOHOTKEY
; It contains a loop, conditional statements, and function calls
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; sets the working directory to the current script's directory
Loop, 10  ; loops through the code 10 times
{
    Random, random_number, 1, 100 ; generates a random number between 1 and 100
    if (random_number < 50) ; checks if the random number is less than 50
    {
        MsgBox, The random number is less than 50  ; displays a message box
        GoSub, Subroutine1 ; calls the Subroutine1 function

        GoSub, Subroutine2 ; calls the Subroutine2 function
    }
    Sleep, 1000 ; waits for 1 second before continuing the loop
