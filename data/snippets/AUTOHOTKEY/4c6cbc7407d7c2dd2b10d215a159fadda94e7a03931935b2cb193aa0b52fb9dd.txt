; This script is written in AutoHotkey, a scripting language for automating tasks on Windows.
 
; Create a hotkey that will be used to trigger the code.
^+p:: 

; Create an infinite loop that will keep the script running until the hotkey is pressed again.
While (1) 
{

  ; Get the currently selected text.
  Clipboard := %clipboard% 

  ; Convert the text to uppercase and add it to the clipboard.
  StringUpper, Clipboard, Clipboard
  Clipboard := Clipboard . " UPPER"

  ; Use the clipboard to type the modified text.
  SendInput %Clipboard% 

  ; Wait for a short period of time before repeating.
  Sleep, 200 
}

; End the loop when the hotkey is pressed again.
return 

; The resulting actions of this script are:
; 1. When the hotkey is pressed, the script will start running.
; 2. The currently selected text will be copied to the clipboard.
; 3. The text will be converted to uppercase and " UPPER" will be added to the end.
; 4. The modified text will be typed out.
; 5. This process will continue until the hotkey is pressed again, ending the loop.
; 
; Example: If the original text is "Hello world", the resulting text entered will be "HELLO WORLD UPPER".
