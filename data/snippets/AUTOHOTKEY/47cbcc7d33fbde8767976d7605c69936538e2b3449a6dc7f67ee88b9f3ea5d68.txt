#IfWinActive ; close conditional statement
; this code snippet defines two hotkeys, F1 and F2, when the Notepad window is active
; F1 sends whatever is in the clipboard as keystrokes
; F2 pastes the data from the clipboard onto a new line in Notepad
; this code snippet utilizes the conditional statement #IfWinActive to only activate these hotkeys when the Notepad window is active and prevent conflicts with other programs
