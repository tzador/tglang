; This code snippet is a script for automatically resizing and positioning windows on the screen
; It uses the Window Manager library for AutoHotkey, available at http://www.autohotkey.net/~dear/Window_Manager_v2/
; After running the script, hold down the Windows key and use the arrow keys to resize and position active windows
#UseHook On ; allows the script to override built-in Windows key hotkeys
#Include Window_Manager.ahk ; includes the Window Manager library

; sets the 4 possible screen edge sizes for windows (in pixels)
smallestSize := 50
smallSize := 100
mediumSize := 300
largeSize := 500

; sets the screen margins in pixels
marginTop := 50
marginBottom := 50
marginLeft := 50
marginRight := 50

SetWinManager("Colors") ; sets the window manager to use color coding for windows

WinAutoPosition("A", "top-left", marginTop, marginLeft, mediumSize, mediumSize) ; automatically positions and resizes the active window to the top left corner of the screen
WinAutoPositionEx("A", "down", "small", "right", marginBottom, mediumSize, smallSize, smallSize) ; automatically positions and resizes the active window below the first window, to the right of it, with a small size
WinAutoPositionEx("A", "down", "medium", "left", marginBottom, mediumSize, smallSize, smallSize) ; automatically positions and resizes the active window below the first window, to the left of it, with a medium size
WinAutoPositionEx("A", "down", "large", "left", marginBottom, mediumSize, largeSize, largeSize) ; automatically positions and resizes the active window below the first window, to the left of it, with a large size

; sets the window manager to use keyboard shortcuts for moving and resizing windows
SetWinManager("Shortcuts")

; defines custom keyboard shortcuts for moving and resizing windows
^!j::WinMove("A", "left", marginLeft) ; moves the active window to the left by the margin amount
^!k::WinMove("A", "right", marginRight) ; moves the active window to the right by the margin amount
^!h::WinMove("A", "up", marginTop) ; moves the active window up by the margin amount
^!l::WinMove("A", "down", marginBottom) ; moves the active window down by the margin amount
^!i::WinResize("A", marginTop, marginLeft, marginBottom, marginRight) ; resizes the active window to fill the screen

; defines custom keyboard shortcuts for cycling through different screen edge sizes
^!n::WinSize("A", smallestSize, smallestSize) ; sets the active window to the smallest size
^!m::WinSize("A", smallSize, smallSize) ; sets the active window to the small size
^!c::WinSize("A", mediumSize, mediumSize) ; sets the active window to the medium size
^!v::WinSize("A", largeSize, largeSize) ; sets the active window to the large size

#UseHook Off ; disables the script's hook on Windows key hotkeys
