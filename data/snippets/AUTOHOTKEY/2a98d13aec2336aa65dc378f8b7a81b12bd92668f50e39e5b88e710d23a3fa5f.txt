; This code snippet is a function written in AutoHotkey
; It calculates the area of a circle with a given radius
AreaOfCircle(r){
    ; Define the constant PI
    PI := 3.14159265359
    ; Square the radius
    rSquared := r * r
    ; Calculate the area using the formula A = Ï€r^2
    area := PI * rSquared
    ; Round the result to 2 decimal places
    area := Round(area, 2)
    ; Return the area as a string
    return "The area of the circle with radius " . r . " is " . area . " units."
}

; Call the function with a radius of 5
AreaOfCircle(5)
