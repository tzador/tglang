; This program uses the Hotstring feature of AutoHotkey to perform an automated download
; of a file from a specific website when a specified keyword is typed.

; ** SET UP HOTSTRING AND URL **
:*:downloadfile::
; The keyword "downloadfile" will trigger this hotstring.
URL := "https://www.example.com/file.zip" ; The URL of the file to download.
RegexMatch(URL, "([^\/]+?)(\.[a-z]+)$", m) ; Extract the file name and extension from the URL.
filename := m1 m2 ; Set the file name to be the first and second capture groups from the regular expression.
filepath := "C:\Temp\" . filename ; Set the destination file path to the Temp folder on the C drive.
FileExists, %filepath% ; Check if the file already exists at the destination.
fileexist := ErrorLevel
If fileexist ; If file exists, add a timestamp to the file name to avoid overwriting.
	filename := m1 "_" A_Now m2 ; A_Now is a built-in variable that contains current date and time.
	filepath := "C:\Temp\" . filename
