; This is a long and complex code snippet in AutoHotkey.

; Define the function "calculate"
Calculate()
{
	; Set the variable "a" to 10
	a := 10
	; Set the variable "b" to 20
	b := 20
	; Calculate the sum of a and b
	sum := a + b
	; Print the sum to the console
	MsgBox, %sum%
	; Calculate the difference of a and b
	diff := a - b
	; Print the difference to the console
	MsgBox, %diff%
	; Calculate the product of a and b
	prod := a * b
	; Print the product to the console
	MsgBox, %prod%
	; Calculate the quotient of a and b
	quot := a / b
	; Print the quotient to the console
	MsgBox, %quot%
	; Calculate the modulus of a and b
	mod := a % b
	; Print the modulus to the console
	MsgBox, %mod%
}
