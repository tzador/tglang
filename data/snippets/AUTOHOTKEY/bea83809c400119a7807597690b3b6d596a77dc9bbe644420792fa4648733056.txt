; This script is designed to automate mouse clicks to perform a series of tasks

; First, we define our variables to store the positions of the clicks and the delay time between clicks
ClickPosX := 500
ClickPosY := 200
ClickDelay := 100

; Next, we create a loop to perform the series of tasks
Loop, 10
{
    ; Move the mouse to the specified position
    MouseMove, %ClickPosX%, %ClickPosY%

    ; Click the left mouse button
    Click

    ; Wait for the specified delay time
    Sleep, ClickDelay

    ; Press the left arrow key
    Send {Left}

    ; Wait for the specified delay time
    Sleep, ClickDelay

    ; Press the right arrow key
    Send {Right}

    ; Wait for the specified delay time
    Sleep, ClickDelay
}

; Once the loop is completed, we display a message box
MsgBox, The task has been completed!

; Lastly, we exit the script
