; This is a long and complex code snippet in the programming language AutoHotkey.

; First, we define a variable for the current date and time.
Variable := A_Now

; Next, we use a loop to generate a list of random numbers between 1 and 10.
Loop, 10
{
	Random, Num, 1, 10
	L := L . Num . " "	; Concatenates each random number to the previous one with a space in between.
}

; We then use an if statement to check if the current date and time is after 12AM.
If (Variable > 12AM)
{
	; If it is, we display a message box with the list of random numbers.
	MsgBox, % "The list of random numbers generated after 12AM is: " . L
}
Else
{
	; If not, we add the current date and time to the list and display it in a message box.
	L := L . Variable . " " . A_Now
	MsgBox, % "The list of random numbers generated is: " . L
}

; Lastly, we use a switch statement to perform different actions based on the current weekday.
Switch A_YYYYMMDD
{
Case A_Sunday:
	; On Sundays, we generate a new list of random numbers and display it in a message box.
	NewList := ""
	Loop, 5
	{
		Random, Num2, 1, 10
		NewList := NewList . Num2 . " "
	}
	MsgBox, % "The new list of random numbers generated on Sundays is: " . NewList
Break	; Stops the switch statement.
Case A_Saturday:
	; On Saturdays, we use a function to add all the numbers in the list and display the total in a message box.
	MsgBox, % "The total of all the numbers in the list generated on Saturdays is: " . Total(L)
}
	
; Finally, we create a function to calculate the total of all the numbers in a list.
; It takes in a list of numbers as a parameter and returns the total.
Total(list)
{
	Sum := 0
	Loop, Parse, list
		Sum += A_LoopField	; Adds each number in the list to the total.
	Return Sum	; Returns the total.
