; This code snippet uses a loop structure to read data from an input file and manipulate it

Loop, read, input.txt ; Reads input from file "input.txt"
{
    StringSplit, line, A_LoopReadLine, `n ; Splits the line into an array based on new line character
    Loop, parse, line1, %A_Space% ; Parses each line based on space character
    {
        global, Index ; Specifies that 'Index' variable is global
        global, Name ; Specifies that 'Name' variable is global
        global, Age ; Specifies that 'Age' variable is global
        If (Index = 1) ; Checks if the index is 1 (first element in array)
        {
            Name := A_LoopField ; Assigns the first element to 'Name' variable
        }
        If (Index = 2) ; Checks if the index is 2 (second element in array)
        {
            Age := A_LoopField ; Assigns the second element to 'Age' variable
        }
        Index := Index + 1 ; Increments index by 1
    }
    StringTrimRight, Age, Age, 1 ; Trims off the last character of the 'Age' variable
    If (IsNumber(Age)) ; Checks if 'Age' variable is a number
    {
        Age := Age + 10 ; Adds 10 to 'Age' variable
        FileAppend, %Name% %Age%`n, output.txt ; Appends output to file "output.txt"
    }
