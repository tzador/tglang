;This is a complex code snippet in the AUTOHOTKEY programming language.

#IfWinActive, ahk_class Chrome_WidgetWin_1
;This line sets the condition for the code to only run if Chrome is the active window.
#MaxHotkeysPerInterval 1000
;Sets the maximum number of hotkeys that can be triggered per second.
;This is useful to prevent the script from running too fast and causing crashes.

;===== Custom Hotkeys =====
;To make these hotkeys work, the #IfWinActive condition must be met.
;These hotkeys will only function when Chrome is the active window.

;**Toggle AutoScroll** Hotkey
;This hotkey will toggle the AutoScroll feature in Chrome.
;If it is currently enabled, it will be disabled, and vice versa.
;This allows for quick and easy scrolling without having to hold down the scroll button.

#space::
;This sets the hotkey for the space bar.
Send, {WheelDown}
;This line sends the command to scroll down using the mouse wheel.
return
;End of hotkey code.

;**Toggle Private Browsing** Hotkey
;This hotkey will toggle the private browsing mode in Chrome.
;If it is currently in private mode, it will switch back to regular browsing, and vice versa.
;This allows for a quick and easy way to switch between browsing modes.

#!p::
;This sets the hotkey for Ctrl + P.
Send, ^+t
;This line sends the command to open a new tab.
Send, incognito
;This line sends the command to enter private browsing.
Send, {Enter}
;This line sends the command to confirm the action and switch to private browsing mode.
return
;End of hotkey code.

;**Custom Mouse Gesture** Hotkey
;This hotkey will activate a custom mouse gesture when performed.
;The gesture will be a right click, followed by a left click, and then a right click again.
;This gesture can be used to quickly open a new tab in Chrome.

~RButton & LButton::
;This sets the trigger as a right mouse click followed by a left mouse click.
Send, ^t
;This line sends the command to open a new tab.
Send, {Ctrl down}{Shift down}{ctrl up}{shift up}
;This line sends the command to switch back to the previous tab.
return
;End of hotkey code.

;===== Custom Functions =====
;These custom functions can be called by other hotkeys or used in the main script.

;**Function to Open Google Translate**
OpenTranslate()
;This calls the function when the hotkey is triggered.
{
	Send, ^t
	;Opens a new tab in Chrome.
	Send, https://translate.google.com/

	{
		;Start of loop.
		TabCount := 1
		;Sets the count for the tabs to 1.
		Loop, %TabLimit%
		;Starts a loop until the tab limit is reached.
		{
			Send, ^w
			;Sends the command to close the current tab.

		}
		If WinActive("ahk_class Chrome_WidgetWin_1")
			;Checks if Chrome is still the active window.
		{
			Loop, %TabLimit%
			;Starts another loop until the tab limit is reached.

				Send, {Ctrl up}
				;Releases the Ctrl key.
			}
		}
