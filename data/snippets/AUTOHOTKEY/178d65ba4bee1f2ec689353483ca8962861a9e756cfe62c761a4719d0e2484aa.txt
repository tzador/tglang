; This code snippet creates a function to automate text input and cursor movement

:loop
  ; Look for the specified text and store the position of the first match in the variable "matchPos"
  PixelSearch, matchPos, searchX, searchY, searchX + searchWidth, searchY + searchHeight, 0x000000, 5, Fast RGB
  if ErrorLevel = 0 ; If no match is found, ErrorLevel will be 1
  {
    ; Move the cursor to the found position
    MouseMove, %matchPosX%, %matchPosY%, 0

    ; Wait for 0.5 seconds to allow time for the text field to become active
    Sleep, 500

    ; Send the desired input text
    Send, Hello World!

    ; Wait for 0.5 seconds before moving the cursor back to the starting position
    Sleep, 500

    ; Move the cursor back to the starting position
    MouseMove, %searchX%, %searchY%, 0
  }
