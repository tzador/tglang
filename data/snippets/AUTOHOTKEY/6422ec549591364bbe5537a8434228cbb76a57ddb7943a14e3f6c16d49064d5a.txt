; This code snippet will create a function that performs a series of tasks when called

function performTasks() {
    ; Set variables to hold values needed for tasks
    local fileName := "example.txt"
    local filePath := "C:\Users\Documents"

    ; Create new file using InputBox for user input

    Send, ^o
    Send, %filePath%\%fileName%
    Send, {Enter}
    Send, %userInput%
    Send, {Enter}

    ; Use loop to repeat task multiple times
    Loop, 5
    {
        ; Display message box with loop count
        MsgBox, Task number %A_index%

        ; Open new tab in browser and navigate to specific URL
