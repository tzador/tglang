; This code snippet uses AutoHotkey to create a tool for automating mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.

; First, we define a hotkey that will trigger the automation:
~^F1::
  SetTimer, AutoClick, 1000
return

; This hotkey will execute our AutoClick subroutine every 1 second.

; Next, we define the AutoClick subroutine:
AutoClick:
  Click 100, 100 ; clicks at coordinates (100, 100) on the screen
  Send hello ; sends "hello" as keyboard input
return

; Now, when the hotkey (~^F1) is pressed, the AutoClick subroutine will be executed every second, effectively automating the click and keyboard input.

; We can also add more complexity to our automation, such as using variables and loops:
~^F2::
  SetTimer, AutoClick2 1000
return

AutoClick2:
  Loop, 5 {
    Random, x, 200, 500 ; generates a random number between 200 and 500
    Random, y, 200, 500 ; generates a random number between 200 and 500
    Click %x%, %y% ; clicks at the random coordinates
  }
return

; This hotkey (~^F2) will execute our AutoClick2 subroutine every 1 second. The subroutine uses a loop to generate 5 random clicks within a specific range of coordinates.

; By using the power of variables and loops, we can create more intricate automation scripts for repetitive tasks.
