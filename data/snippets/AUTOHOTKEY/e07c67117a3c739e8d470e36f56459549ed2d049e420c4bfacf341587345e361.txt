; Function to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return 1 ; Factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
    }
    else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1) ; Recursively call the function with n-1
    }
}

; Function called with parameter 5 to calculate factorial
result := factorial(5)

MsgBox, % "The factorial of 5 is " . result

; Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
