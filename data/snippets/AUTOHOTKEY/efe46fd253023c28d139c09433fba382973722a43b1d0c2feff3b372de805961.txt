; This is a code snippet in AutoHotkey that showcases a complex function
; It takes in two parameters, n1 and n2, and calculates the sum of all even numbers between them.

; Define function sumEven
sumEven(n1, n2) 

{
   ; Initialize variables
   sum := 0
   i := n1

   ; Use loop to iterate through numbers between n1 and n2
   Loop % (n2 - n1 + 1)

   {
      ; Add current number to sum if even
      if (Mod(i, 2) = 0)
         sum := sum + i

      ; Increment counter
      i := i + 1
   }

   ; Return the final sum
   return sum
}

; Call function and store result in variable
evenSum := sumEven(1, 10)

; Display output
MsgBox % "The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 10 is " . evenSum
