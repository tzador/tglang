; This code snippet is a calculation program designed to calculate the area of a circle

; Define the radius variable
radius := 5

; Define the pi constant
pi := 3.14159

; Calculate the area of the circle using the formula A = πr^2
area := pi * radius ** 2

; Print the calculated area to the user
MsgBox % "The area of the circle with radius " . radius . " is " . area

; Create a function to calculate the circumference of a circle
Circumference(radius) {
	; Calculate the circumference using the formula C = 2πr
	return 2 * pi * radius
}

; Call the function and save the result to a variable
circ := Circumference(radius)

; Print the calculated circumference to the user
MsgBox % "The circumference of the circle with radius " . radius . " is " . circ
