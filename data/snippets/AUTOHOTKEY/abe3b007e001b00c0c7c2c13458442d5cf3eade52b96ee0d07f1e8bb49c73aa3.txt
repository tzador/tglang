; This code snippet creates a loop that will type out a sentence 
; five times with a randomized pause between each iteration.

sentence := "This is a sentence."

; Create a function to generate a random number between 1 and 5
RandomTime() {
    Random, num, 1, 5
    return num
}

; Set initial counter to 0
counter := 0

; Start loop while counter is less than 5
while(counter < 5) {

    ; Type out the sentence
    Send %sentence%

    ; Generate a random pause time
    pause := RandomTime()

    ; Pause for random amount of time
    sleep %pause% * 1000

    ; Increment counter
    counter++
}
