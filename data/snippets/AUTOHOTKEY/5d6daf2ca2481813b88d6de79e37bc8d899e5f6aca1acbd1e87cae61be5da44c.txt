; This code snippet creates a simple loop that outputs numbers from 1 to 10
; It uses a variable to keep track of the current number and uses a while loop to iterate
; Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

counter := 1            ; initialize counter variable to 1

while (counter <= 10)   ; while loop to iterate from 1 to 10
{
    msgbox % counter    ; displays the current number in a pop-up message box
    counter++           ; increase the counter by 1 for the next iteration
}                       ; end of while loop
