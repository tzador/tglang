; This code snippet creates a customizable text-based game in AutoHotkey
; The game is called "Hunt for the Hidden Treasure" and the player has to explore a mysterious island to find the treasure
; The game uses user input through a GUI and includes various functions and loops

#SingleInstance, force  ; Ensures only one instance of the game is running at a time

; Set up game variables
global game_running := true  ; Indicates if the game is currently running or not
global player_name := ""  ; Stores the player's name
global player_location := "Beach"  ; Indicates the player's current location on the island

; Create GUI for user input
Gui, Add, Text,, Welcome to Hunt for the Hidden Treasure! Please enter your name:
Gui, Add, Edit, vPlayerName,  ; Stores the player's input for their name
Gui, Add, Button, x+10 y+10 gStartGame, Start Game  ; Button to start the game
Gui, Show  ; Displays the GUI to the user

; Start game by initiating a loop
StartGame:
while (game_running)  ; Loop will continue until game_running variable is false
{
	; Display current location and provide options for player to choose from
	Gui, Add, Text,, You are currently at %player_location%. Where would you like to go next?
	Gui, Add, Radio, vNewLocation1, Temple  ; Radio button options for player to choose from
	Gui, Add, Radio, vNewLocation2, Cave
	Gui, Add, Radio, vNewLocation3, Forest
	Gui, Add, Radio, vNewLocation4, Stay at current location
	Gui, Add, Button, x+10 y+10 gContinueGame, Continue Game  ; Button to continue game
	Gui, Show  ; Updates the GUI with new options
}

; Function to check if player has found the hidden treasure
CheckForTreasure:
if (player_location = "Treasure")  ; Checks if player is at the treasure location
{
	MsgBox, Congratulations %player_name%! You have found the hidden treasure!
	game_running := false  ; Ends the game loop
	ExitApp  ; Exits the game
}
else
{
	player_location := "Beach"  ; Resets player location if they have not found the treasure
}

; Function to handle user input and move player to chosen location
GoToLocation:
if (NewLocation1 = 1)  ; Checks if player has selected the first location option
{
	player_location := "Temple"
}
else if (NewLocation2 = 1)  ; Checks if player has selected the second location option
{
	player_location := "Cave"
}
else if (NewLocation3 = 1)  ; Checks if player has selected the third location option
{
	player_location := "Forest"
}
; No code for the fourth option as player will stay at the current location

ContinueGame:
Gui, Destroy  ; Destroys the current GUI to update with new options
GoToLocation()  ; Calls the function to handle the player's chosen location
CheckForTreasure()  ; Calls the function to check if player has found the hidden treasure
}
