; This code snippet is a complex function in Autohotkey that calculates the average of a given list of numbers
; The code snippet takes in a list of numbers and returns the average as a float value

; Variable declaration
nums := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ; change this list to any set of numbers you want to find average of
sum := 0 ; variable to hold the sum of all numbers
average := 0 ; variable to store the calculated average

; Loop through the list of numbers
for index, num in nums
{
    ; Add each number to the sum variable
    sum := sum + num

    ; Check if it is the last number in the list
    if (index = nums.Length() - 1)
    {
        ; Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of numbers in the list
        average := sum / nums.Length()

        ; Display the average in a message box
        MsgBox, The average of the numbers is %average%

        ; Exit the loop
        break
    }
}

; Function that calculates the average using recursion
CalcAverage(VarNums, start=1, end=VarNums.Length())
{
    ; Base case: if only one number remains, return that number
    if (end = start)
        return VarNums[end]

    ; Use recursion to divide the problem into smaller parts
    average := (VarNums[start] + CalcAverage(VarNums, start+1, end)) / end

    ; Return the calculated average
    return average
}

; Call the recursive function
recursiveAverage := CalcAverage(nums)

; Display the recursive average in a message box
MsgBox, The average of the numbers using recursion is %recursiveAverage%
