; This code snippet uses 'for' loop to iterate through a list of numbers and perform a calculation on each number.
; The output is a new list with the calculated values.

numbers := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ; Create a list of numbers

new_list := [] ; Create an empty list to store the calculated values

for number in numbers { ; Start 'for' loop to iterate through the list
    result := number * number ; Perform calculation on each number
    new_list.push(result) ; Add the calculated value to the new list
}

msgbox % "Original list: " . numbers . "`nCalculated list: " . new_list ; Display the original and calculated lists in a message box

; Output:
; Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
; Calculated list: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
