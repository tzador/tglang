; This code snippet generates a random password with specific criteria

; Define the string of characters to be used in the password
characters := "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()"

; Get the user's desired length for the password
inputBox("Enter the desired length of the password:", "Password Generator", "", "passwordLength")

; Set initial values for the variables
counter:= 0
password := ""

; Loop through the number of characters to be used
Loop, % passwordLength
{
    ; Get a random number within the range of the string of characters
    Random, randomChar, 1, StrLen(characters)

    ; Get the character at the random index in the string
    char := SubStr(characters, randomChar, 1)

    ; Check if the character is already present in the password
    if NotInStr(password, char)
    {
        ; If not present, add it to the password
        password .= char
        
        ; Increment the counter
        counter += 1
        
        ; If the counter reaches the desired length, end the loop
        if (counter = passwordLength) 
            break
    }
    ; If the character is already present, decrement the loop and try again
    else {
        A_Index--
    }
}

; Display the generated password in a message box
MsgBox, 0, , Your randomly generated password is:`n`n%password%
