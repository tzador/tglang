; This code snippet is a function in AutoHotkey that takes in two strings, checks if they are equal and returns a boolean value

; Define the function called "CompareStrings"
CompareStrings(firstString, secondString) {

    ; Declare a boolean variable called "result" and set it to false
    result := false

    ; Check if the two strings are equal by using the "if" statement
    if (firstString == secondString) {
        ; If they are equal, set "result" to true
        result := true
    }

    ; Return the result
    return result
}

; Call the "CompareStrings" function with two strings as parameters
; Assign the returned value to a variable called "isEqual"
isEqual := CompareStrings("Hello", "Hello")

; Display the value of "isEqual"
MsgBox % isEqual
