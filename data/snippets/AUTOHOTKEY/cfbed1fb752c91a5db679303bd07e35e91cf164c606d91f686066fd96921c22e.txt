; This code snippet generates a random password using AUTOHOTKEY language
; The user can specify the length of the password and whether to include numbers or special characters

#SingleInstance force
; Sets AutoHotkey to only allow one instance of the script to run

length := 10 
; Specifies the default length of the password, can be changed by the user

includeNumbers := True 
; Specifies whether the password should include numbers (True) or not (False)

includeSpecialChars := True
; Specifies whether the password should include special characters (True) or not (False)

characters := "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" 
; Specifies the characters that can be used in the password

if (includeNumbers) 
	{
		 characters .= "0123456789" 	
	; Adds numbers to the list of allowed characters if includeNumbers is set to True
	}

if (includeSpecialChars) 
	{
		 characters .= "`~!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]\|;:'"<>,./?"
	; Adds special characters to the list of allowed characters if includeSpecialChars is set to True
	}

password := ""
; Initializes the password variable to an empty string

Loop %length% 
	{
		random, index, 1, StrLen(characters) 
	; Generates a random number between 1 and the length of the characters string

		Char := SubStr(characters, index, 1) 
	; Retrieves the character at the randomly generated index from the characters string

		password .= Char 
	; Appends the retrieved character to the password string
	}

MsgBox, %password% 
; Displays the generated password in a message box
