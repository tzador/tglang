;This code snippet is an example of a function that uses loops and arrays in AutoHotkey.
;The goal of this function is to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.

;Create an array with unsorted numbers
numbers := [5, 3, 8, 1, 6, 4, 9, 2, 7]

;Define a function to sort the array
Sort(array) {
    ;Use a while loop to continue sorting until array is in correct order
    while (1) {
        swapped := false ;Initialize variable to track if a swap has been made
        ;Use a for loop to iterate through the array
        for (i := 1; i < array.Length(); i++) {
            ;Compare current element with next element
            if (array[i] > array[i+1]) {
                ;Swap elements if current element is larger than next element
                temp := array[i]
                array[i] := array[i+1]
                array[i+1] := temp
                swapped := true ;Indicate that a swap has been made
            }
        }
        ;If no swaps were made in the previous for loop, then array is sorted
        if (!swapped) {
            break ;Exit while loop
        }
    }
    ;Return the sorted array
    return array
}

sorted_numbers := Sort(numbers) ;Call the sort function and assign the sorted array to a variable

;Print the sorted array
Loop % sorted_numbers.Length()
    ;Use the index of the loop to access each element in the array and print it
    MsgBox, % "Number " . A_Index . " is " . sorted_numbers[A_Index]
