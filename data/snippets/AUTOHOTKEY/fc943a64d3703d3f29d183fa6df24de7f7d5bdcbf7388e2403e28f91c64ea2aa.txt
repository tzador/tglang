; This is a complex code snippet in AutoHotkey using a function
; that generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

; define a function to generate a Fibonacci sequence
Fibonacci(n) {
    if (n < 2) ; check if n is less than 2 (the first 2 numbers in a Fibonacci sequence are always 0 and 1)
        return n ; if n is less than 2, return n
    else ; if n is greater than or equal to 2
        return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2) ; return the sum of the previous 2 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
    
}

; prompt the user for a number to generate the sequence up to
InputBox, maxNumber, Enter number, Enter a number to generate Fibonacci sequence up to:, , 300, 150

; initialize variables for the first 2 numbers in the sequence
num1 := 0
num2 := 1

; create a loop to generate the sequence
Loop % maxNumber {
    ; use the Fibonacci function to calculate the next number in the sequence
    nextNum := Fibonacci(A_Index)
    
    ; print the number to the user
    MsgBox, % "Number at position " A_Index " is: " nextNum
    
    ; update the variables for the next iteration of the loop
    num1 := num2
    num2 := nextNum
}
