This code snippet creates a program that automates a repetitive task of opening multiple tabs in a web browser and filling them with specific URLs.

#SingleInstance, force ; ensures that only one instance of the program is running at a time

; { } create a block of code with multiple statements
; the "Hotkey" keyword creates a keyboard shortcut
; "!^z" represents the Alt+Ctrl+Z keyboard combination
; "::" is the syntax for creating a hotkey

Hotkey, !^z::
{
    ; "Loop" is used to repeat a block of code a specified number of times
    ; In this case, we want to open 10 tabs, so "10" is used as the number of repeats
    Loop, 10
    {
        ; "Run" is used to open a program or file
        ; In this case, we want to open a web browser, so the URL is specified after "Run"
        Run, www.example.com
        
        ; "::" is used to separate multiple statements in a single line
        ; "^t" represents the Ctrl+T keyboard combination
        ; "{Left}" is used to simulate pressing the "left" arrow key
        SendInput, ^t::{Left}
        
        ; "ClipWait" waits for the Clipboard to be updated before continuing to the next line of code
        ; This is necessary because the URL may take some time to load, and we want to ensure that the next line of code is only executed once the URL has been copied to the Clipboard
        ClipWait
        
        ; "SendInput" sends keyboard input to the active window
        ; In this case, we want to paste the URL from the Clipboard into the address bar of the web browser
        ; "{Enter}" simulates pressing the "Enter" key
        SendInput, ^v{Enter}
        
        ; "Sleep" pauses the program for a specified number of milliseconds
        ; This is to allow the webpage to fully load before moving on to the next iteration of the loop
        Sleep, 5000
        
        ; "Alt" sends an Alt key press
        ; "{F4}" simulates pressing the "F4" key
        ; This closes the current tab in the web browser
        SendInput, !{F4}
        
        ; "Sleep" again to allow for the tab to close before moving on to the next iteration of the loop
        Sleep, 500
    }
