; This code snippet is written in AutoHotkey, a free and open-source scripting language for automating Windows tasks.
; It demonstrates how to create a custom user interface using the GUI commands in AutoHotkey.

; First, we need to define a function that will be triggered when a specific button is clicked on our custom GUI.
; We will call this function "OpenFile".
OpenFile()
{
  ; Shows a file open dialog box and stores the selected file path in the variable "FilePath".
  FileSelectFile, FilePath
  ; Now we can use the "MsgBox" command to display a message with the selected file path.
  MsgBox Selected file path: %FilePath%
}

; Next, we will define our main GUI window using the "Gui" command.
; We will give it a title, set its size and position on the screen, and specify that it should be resizable.
Gui, Add, Text, x20 y20 w100 h40, Select a File to Open
; This creates a static text element with the specified position and size.
; We will use it to give some information to the user about what to do next.
Gui, Add, Button, x20 y60 w80 h30 gOpenFile, Open File
; This creates a button element with the specified position, size, and the "gOpenFile" option.
; The "gOpenFile" option tells AutoHotkey to trigger the "OpenFile" function when the button is clicked.
Gui, Show, w150 h120, My Custom GUI
; Finally, we show the GUI window with the specified title and size.

; Lastly, we need to add a hotkey to our script that will trigger the GUI to show up when pressed.
^+o::Gui, Show
; This creates a hotkey (control + shift + o) that will trigger the GUI's "Show" command when pressed.

; And that's it! Now, when we run our script, a small GUI window will appear.
; Clicking on the "Open File" button will open up a file dialog box and display the selected file path in a message.
; This snippet is just a basic example of what can be done with AutoHotkey's GUI commands, the possibilities are endless.
