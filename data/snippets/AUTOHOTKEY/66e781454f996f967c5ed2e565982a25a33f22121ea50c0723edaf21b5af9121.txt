; This code snippet generates a randomized password of given length using AUTOHOTKEY

Random, length, 10, 20 ; generates a random number between 10 and 20 to determine password length
Loop %length% ; iterates through the chosen length
{
    Random, char, 33, 126 ; generates a random number between 33 and 126 to determine ASCII character
	chr := Chr(char) ; converts the ASCII number to a character
    pass .= chr ; appends character to password
}
MsgBox, % pass ; displays the generated password in a pop-up message box
