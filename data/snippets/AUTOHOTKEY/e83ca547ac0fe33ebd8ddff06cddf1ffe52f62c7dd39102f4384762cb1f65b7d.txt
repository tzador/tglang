; This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
Factorial(n) {
    ; Initialize result with 1
    result := 1
    ; Loop through numbers from 1 to n
    Loop, %n%
    {
        ; Multiply result with the current number
        result *= A_Index
    }
    ; Return calculated factorial
    return result
}
