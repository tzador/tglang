; This code snippet demonstrates the use of a while loop in AutoHotkey
; The loop will continue until the user types "exit" 
; It will also count the number of times the loop is executed and 
; print it out after the loop finishes

counter := 0

; Start of while loop
while(true) {

    ; Prompting user for input
    InputBox, userInput, Please enter a value, Type "exit" to stop the loop

    ; Checking if user input is "exit", if yes, exit the loop
    if (userInput = "exit") {
        break
    }

    ; Incrementing counter by 1 for each loop iteration
    counter := counter + 1

}

MsgBox, The loop has executed %counter% times.
