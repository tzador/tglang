+ store(&n) {
    ^ start with a plus sign to indicate a function
    `="This function stores the value of n in memory"` 
    $$(n,n) --> This line indicates the function takes in two arguments, both with a type of `n` 
    `n = n * n` --> This code snippet stores the value of the argument `n` in memory by squaring it and updating the value
    `^ return n;` --> This line of code indicates the value of `n` will be returned when the function is called
