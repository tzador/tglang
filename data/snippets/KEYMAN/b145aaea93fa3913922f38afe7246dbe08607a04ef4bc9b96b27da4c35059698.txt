+ [CTRL K_1] > "h" + [SHIFT] > "H";
\ c syntax
This code snippet generates a rule that, when the user presses the CTRL key and the "1" key simultaneously, outputs an "h" character. If the SHIFT key is held down as well, it outputs an "H" instead.

+ & [SHIFT K_4] > "f" + b: > "F";
\ c syntax
Here, the "+" sign indicates that the rule is using simple output strings instead of key codes. This rule will output an "f" character when the SHIFT and "4" keys are pressed together. If the "b" rule context is active, it will output an "F" instead, demonstrating the use of rule contexts to modify output based on keyboard state.
