Context and mapping file for the KEYMAN keyboard which provides access to a special naming context.

## Contexts

Contexts allow separate definitions for how characters are handled based on where they appear in the text. This is especially useful for languages with complex orthographies where characters may have different forms depending on their location, such as in Arabic or Indic scripts.

The `store` function is used to store the `namingContext` variable, which is set to a string of characters in the first line. This string will be added to the `namingContext` variable defined in the `CONTEXT` file. 

Next, the `+`, `any`, and `nul` operators are used to check for the end of the string. If the end is reached, the keyboard will output the message "reached end of string".

The `% KeymanWeb Keyboard` line indicates that this is a KeymanWeb keyboard.

In the `begin` block, the `Unicode` function is used to specify the character encoding used for the keyboard. The `use` command is used to point to the `mainkey` function, which contains the main logic for the keyboard.

The `mainkey` function starts with the `any` operator and the `nul` character, followed by the `+` operator and the `any` function with the special string defined earlier. This `break` command indicates that if both conditions are true, the keyboard should stop processing and output the current result.

Next, the `store` function is used to store the `original` variable, which is set to the result of finding the index of any character using the `index` function. It then uses the `any` function with the `c` character, followed by the `index_match` function, which is defined later in the code.

In the `index_match` function, the `outs` function is used to specify that any characters that match the `home` variable should be identified and processed. The `identify` function is used to set the `c` variable to any character.

Next, the `define` function is used to specify that the `top` variable should be set to the `home` variable, followed by the `store` function with the `auto` variable. The `set` function is then used to set the `auto` variable.

In the `identify` function, the `c` variable is set to any character, followed by the `any` function and the `U` character. If a character matching this pattern is found, the `set` function is used to set the `U` variable and the `final` function, which indicates that this is the final processing step, is used to encode the `attachIn` function with the `getType` function, which will output the message "That's wrong, try again." if the input is incorrect.

The `outs` function is then used along with the `home` variable to output the result of the `set` function with the `auto` variable. Finally, the `context` function with the `nul` character specifies that the keyboard should output a null result if no other conditions are met. This will prevent unintended output in case the input does not match any of the defined conditions.

The final comment block provides information about the purpose of this keyboard and the different contexts used in its logic. Overall, this code snippet showcases the use of functions, variables, and operators in the KEYMAN programming language, as well as its ability to handle different contexts and characters.
