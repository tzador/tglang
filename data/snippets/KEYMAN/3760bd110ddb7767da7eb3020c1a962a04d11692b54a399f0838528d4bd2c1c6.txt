// This code snippet shows an example of using keyman syntax to store and lookup rules in a main store.
// The syntax uses match statements to match contexts, ifany statements to detect any occurrences of a rule, and ifkey statements to check for a specific layer.
// The code snippet also demonstrates the use of context and index statements to manipulate the rule and context being referenced.
