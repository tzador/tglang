<!-- The code snippet creates a use function that takes in a store parameter and matches it against various secure inputs. Depending on the input type, a specific key is retrieved from the manage object. The store object contains a secure_input object with nested objects and their respective keys. In this example, the use function is retrieving the username, password, email, and phone keys from the manage object and matching them to the input values provided in the store object.  -->
