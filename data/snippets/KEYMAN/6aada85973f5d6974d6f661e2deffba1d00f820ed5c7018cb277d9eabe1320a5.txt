+MANUAL SAM_GHOST Sil+ c > "ghost sil: " + " " + sp 1

Adobe Inc.'s KEYMAN programming language is a keyboard layout editor designed to facilitate the creation of customized keyboards for various languages and scripts. This code snippet creates a new rule that will insert the text "ghost sil:" followed by a space, and then inserts a manual silent ghost character, indicated by the "Sil" keyword. The "c" before the greater than symbol ">" indicates that this rule should only apply when the letter "c" is typed. The "+" before "MANUAL" indicates that this rule should not interrupt text flow. The "sp" command adds a space between the ghost character and any subsequent text.
