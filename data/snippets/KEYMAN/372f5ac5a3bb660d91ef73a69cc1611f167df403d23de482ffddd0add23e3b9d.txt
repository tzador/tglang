This code snippet in KEYMAN creates a store function called "main" that uses any consonant followed by any vowel and any consonant.
The output is then indexed in the "main" group and used for any subsequent consonant.
The characters "c", "d", "e", "p", and "t" are assigned with specific Unicode characters, allowing for easier typing and processing of these letters.
The ".end" tag marks the end of the code snippet.
