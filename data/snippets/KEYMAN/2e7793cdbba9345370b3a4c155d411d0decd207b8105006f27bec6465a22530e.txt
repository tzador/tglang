store(&test) 'This is a test store'   # This is a store statement that stores a string value in a variable called 'test'
if(nothing) 'This is a test if statement' + 'This is a second part of the test'   # This is an if statement with two parts, the first being a condition and the second being a concatenation of two strings
else                            # Else statement that will be executed if the condition in the if statement is false
    outs('Hello world!')        # This is an outs statement that will output the string 'Hello world!' to the keyboard
begin                           # Begin statement that marks the start of the main code block

    outs('This is a consonant')     # Outs statement that will output the string 'This is a consonant' to the keyboard
match(vowel) 'This is a test match statement for vowels'       # Match statement that will be executed if the character is a vowel
outs('This is a vowel')     # Outs statement that will output the string 'This is a vowel' to the keyboard

define('Function1', '(a,b) return a + b')     # This is a function definition that takes two parameters and returns their sum
define('Function2', '(a) return a * a')        # This is another function definition that takes one parameter and returns its squared value
call('Function1', 2, 5)     # Call statement that will call 'Function1' with the arguments 2 and 5
call('Function2', 3)        # Call statement that will call 'Function2' with the argument 3
