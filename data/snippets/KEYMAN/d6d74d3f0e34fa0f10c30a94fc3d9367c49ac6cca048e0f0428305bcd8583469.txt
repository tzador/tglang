Exploration based on specified letter(base) and KEYCODE_BASE.
Outputs the specified execution and top value of the keyman.

The code starts with the `<![CDATA[` tag, indicating that the following code is to be treated as raw data. This is common practice in the Keyman language.

Next, we define a rule using the `+` symbol. This rule is triggered by the `any` function, which means it can match any input. It includes a `base` parameter that can take any value. The rule is then followed by a string literal, `"r"`, and the `base` parameter enclosed in double quotes. This means that the output will be the letter "r" followed by whatever value was passed in as the `base` parameter.

The next line defines another rule using the `any` function, but this time it expects a `letter(base)` input. This means it will only match a letter value followed by the value of the `base` parameter. The rule is then followed by the `base` parameter, the `KEYCODE_BASE` constant, and the `output` function with the `top` value passed in as a parameter. This means that when this rule is triggered, it will output the execution and top value of the keyman.

Finally, the last line contains an `afterN` function, which defines the number of characters that should be skipped before executing the rule. In this case, it is set to the `base` parameter, meaning that the rule will only be executed if the character that triggered it is found after the specified number of characters, in this case `base`.

This complex code snippet showcases some of the advanced features of the Keyman language, such as the use of functions and parameters, as well as the `afterN` function for more precise rule matching.
