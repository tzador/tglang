Group(any+latin) Using keys
    + [CTRL ALT o] > U+00F6

This code snippet creates a group for any Latin characters and assigns the key sequence CTRL ALT o to output the character Ã– (U+00F6). The plus sign indicates that the key combination should be added to the existing combination, and the greater than sign indicates which character to output. This group can be used in a keyboard layout to make it easier to type Latin-based characters.
