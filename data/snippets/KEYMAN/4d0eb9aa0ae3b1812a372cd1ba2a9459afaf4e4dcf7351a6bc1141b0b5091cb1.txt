# THIS IS A COMPLEX CODE SNIPPET IN KEYMAN

store(&Name) 'KEYMAN'   c This stores the string value 'KEYMAN' in the variable &Name.
store(&Lang) 'Programming Language'   c This stores the string value 'Programming Language' in the variable &Lang.

begin    c This is the beginning of the code.

    + any(cons)  c This rule will match when any consonant is typed.

    match ([AEIOU]) '[$1$1]'    c This rule will match when any vowel (A, E, I, O, U)
                                c is typed and output the matched vowel twice.

    + "=" > context(KEYMAN) '{&Lang}(($1))'    c This rule will match when the equals sign is typed.
                                                c It will output 'Programming Language' in parenthesis
                                                c after the variable &Lang and the typed value in
                                                c curly braces.

    nomatch() 'Please type something else.'     c This rule will match when no other rules are matched.
                                                c It will output the message 'Please type something else.'

end    c This is the end of the code.

# THIS COMPLEX CODE SNIPPET WILL OUTPUT:

# If the user types a consonant, it will output the value stored in &Name.
# If the user types a vowel, it will output the matched vowel twice.
# If the user types an equals sign, it will output the variable &Lang with the string 'Programming Language' in parenthesis and the typed value in curly braces.
# If the user types anything else, it will output the message 'Please type something else.'
