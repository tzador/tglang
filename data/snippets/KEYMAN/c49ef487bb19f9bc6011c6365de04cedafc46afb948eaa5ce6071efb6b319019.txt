+$ n @k  ** [a 0] ^ [A 0]   + k ^ ^ 

// This is a code snippet in KEYMAN language that creates a basic keyboard layout.

// The + sign adds a new character or rule to the keyboard.

// The $ symbol indicates that the following characters should be available once the keyboard is turned on.

// The n symbol indicates that when the user presses the "n" key, the keyboard should go into a new key shift state.

// The @k command sets the current keyboard state to "k", which means that when the user types "n" followed by "k", it will output the character "@k".

// The ** symbol indicates that all the following rules should be applied to the "k" key shift state.

// The [a 0] rule creates a new key that outputs the lowercase "a" character.

// The ^ symbol indicates that the following rule should only be applied in the next key shift state.

// The [A 0] rule creates a new key that outputs the uppercase "A" character.

// The + symbol indicates that the following rule should be added to the existing key shift state.

// The k symbol indicates that this rule should be applied in the "k" key shift state.

// The ^ symbol indicates that the following rule should only be applied in the next key shift state.

// The ^ symbol indicates that the following rule should only be applied to the previous key shift state.

// The output of this code snippet would be a keyboard layout where typing "nk" would output "@k", and pressing the "k" key would output the lowercase "a" character, but only in the key shift state "k".
