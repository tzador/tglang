/*
This code snippet in KEYMAN programming language creates a deadkey that replaces any chosen character with a special "JKL" character. The deadkey is triggered when the user presses 'CTRL + F4' and releases, and it stores the character code in 'x' for later use.
First, the deadkey is triggered, and the character code is stored in 'x' and passed through the 'f' function. Then, the deadkey uses the 'store' function to store an empty string in 'x'. This effectively replaces the original character with an empty string.
Next, the deadkey passes the modified character code through the 'c' function, which converts it to the desired "JKL" character code. Finally, the modified character code is returned and the 'CTRL + F4' key combination is pressed again, resulting in the output of the "JKL" character.*/
