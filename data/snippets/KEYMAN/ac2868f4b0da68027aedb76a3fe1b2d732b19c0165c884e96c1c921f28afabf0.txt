To understand the code, here is a brief explanation:

This code snippet shows how to create a custom keyboard layout in the programming language KEYMAN. It first waits for the keyboard to be activated, then defines a context and a layer list as empty strings. It then stores the value of b1, which represents the first layer, in a variable. The next section of the code defines the actions for different key combinations, using the + symbol to indicate a key combination and > to indicate the output of the combination. Some keys, such as the NumPad0 and [Ctrl Left], have multiple outputs that are separated by the symbol `. The code also includes instructions for adding special characters, such as emojis or Greek letters, as outputs for specific key combinations. Finally, the code defines a sequence to clear the variables used in the layer list and exits the script.
