" Defines a basic function to return the sum of two numbers
+ & [c] [d] 'Add_and_print_2_numbers (c,d)
  ' Calculate the sum and store in 'output'
  ' 'Function' signal to Keyman compiler to recognize as a function
  'Keyman compiler reads the name of the function and its parameters
  'c' and 'd' are the names of the parameters passed to the function
  x 'the sum of the two numbers
  x = c + d
  ' 'Return' signal to Keyman compiler to end function and output result
  ' By default, Keyman assumes 'integer' for function return type
  ' Use 'Output()' function to return result as string
  ' ';' is used to add comments in Keyman code
  ' the final output will be in the format 'The sum of x and y is z'
  ' Example: 'The sum of 3 and 5 is 8'
  ' operator '+' is used to concatenate strings
  ' return result as string
  ' ';' is used to add comments in Keyman code
  Output("The sum of " + c + " and " + d + " is " + x + ".");'
  ' Note: the names of the parameters passed can be changed, but the function name and number of parameters should match the definition.
  ' End signal to Keyman compiler to end function
  ' This function can now be called by another function or in the main code 
  ' '+' operator also used for arithmetic addition if both parameters are numbers
