store(n); + 'dfg' > CONTEXT n + "^$% # Matches a key with name 'dfg' 
                  + the current value of 'n' + '^$%'
                  + Any char not in '^$%' zero or more times`

Using the above code snippet, you can store a value in the KEYMAN context for later use. The CONTEXT command allows you to create a context and the store() function allows you to store a value in that context. In this example, the value being stored is the string 'dfg' and it will be concatenated with the current value of n and the string '^$%' to form the matched key. The '^$%' specifies that any character, except for '^', '$', and '%' can be matched zero or more times. This code snippet can be used in various applications that require dynamic key generation.
