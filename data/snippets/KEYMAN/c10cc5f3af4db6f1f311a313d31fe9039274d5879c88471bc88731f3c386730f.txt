' This is a function that takes in two parameters and returns an integer
' First parameter, n, is the number for which the factorial is to be calculated
' Second parameter, k, is the modulo by which the factorial is to be calculated
' This function uses recursion to calculate the factorial and handles negative input values
' by returning 0
Function Factorial(n, k) {
    If n < 0 Then
        Return 0
    Else
        Return n * Factorial(n - 1, k) Mod k
    Endif
}

' Main program that prompts user for input and calls the Factorial function
' Prints the factorial result with the specified modulo to the console
Begin Main
    ' Get input from user
    Input "Enter a number: ", n
    Input "Enter modulo: ", k

    ' Call the Factorial function and store result in variable x
    Let x = Factorial(n,k)

    ' Print the result to the console with explanation
    Output "The factorial of " + n + " mod " + k + " is " + x
End Main
