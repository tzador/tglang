any(keys) + "1" > index(keys, 1)    c stores the "1" key in the variable c if any key is pressed and then outputs the corresponding value from the keys array
c stores the output

index(keys, "1") + "1" > index(keys, 2)    c checks if the value stored in c is "1" and if it is, it sets the index to 2 in the keys array
c is now set to the output from the keys array

store(c, index(keys, 2)) > output(c)    stores the output from the previous step in the variable c and then outputs it as a final result
