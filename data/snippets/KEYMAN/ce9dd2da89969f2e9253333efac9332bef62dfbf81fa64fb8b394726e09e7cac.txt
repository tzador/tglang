+ any(index) any(index) >> context(index - 1)
"  step1: start a contextual rule called 'any'
group(index) defines the character index to match
any(index) defines the character group to match at that index

context(index - 1) creates a context match, moving the index back by 1
" step2: define the output result of the rule
This could include any KEYMAN language code, such as
index + 10 outputs the character at the index + 10 position
" step3: close the rule with a semicolon
