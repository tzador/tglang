+ store(&gcs);
store is a built-in function in KEYMAN that allows for storing text or variables into a variable.
&gcs is the name of the variable that will store the text or value.
The plus sign indicates the beginning of the line and signifies that this is a function call.

+ if(exists(&gcs)) {
The if() function checks if the variable exists and will only execute the code inside the curly braces if the variable exists.

    &value = getvalue(&gcs);
Inside the curly braces, we can store the value of the existing variable into a new variable using getvalue().
&value is the name of the new variable.
&gcs is the name of the existing variable that we want to store the value of.
    if &value contains "Hello" {
        alert("Hello World!");
    }
    The if statement inside the if() function allows for further checks on the value of the existing variable.
    This if statement checks if &value contains the string "Hello" and if it does, it will display an alert with the message "Hello World!".
}

+ add(&gcs, "Keyman")
The add() function allows for adding text or numbers to an existing variable.
In this case, we are adding the string "Keyman" to the variable &gcs.

+ output(&gcs, "myVar.txt")
The output() function allows for printing the value of a variable to a file.
In this example, we are printing the value of &gcs to a file named "myVar.txt".
