// This code snippet is a program written in the KEYMAN programming language.
// It calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
// The KEYMAN programming language is used for creating keyboard layouts and input methods.

// Define a function to calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
func fibonacci(n) {
    if n <= 1 {
        // If the input is 0 or 1, return the input as it is the base case
        return n
    }
    else {
        // If the input is greater than 1, recursively call the function to calculate the previous 2 terms and add them together
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    }
}

// Get user input for the desired term in the Fibonacci sequence
var term = input("Enter the term you want to calculate: ")

// Convert the input to an integer
var num = int(term)

// Call the fibonacci function with the input value and store the result in a variable
var result = fibonacci(num)

// Print the result to the screen
print("The " + term + " term in the Fibonacci sequence is: " + result)
