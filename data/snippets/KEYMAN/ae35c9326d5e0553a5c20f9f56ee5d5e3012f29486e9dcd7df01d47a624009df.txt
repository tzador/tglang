store(&ch, "abc") + [ "h" "'" "i" ] > nul + key "a" "b" "c" > "h" "'" "i"

// This code stores the string "abc" in the variable "ch" and then adds the characters "h" and "'" and "i" to the end of the string. The "nul" command is used to ensure that there is no output when the key "abc" is pressed. When the key "abc" is pressed, the Keyman engine will output the characters "h" "'" "i".
