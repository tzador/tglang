## This is a complex code snippet in the KEYMAN programming language.

store(vowels) "aeiou"                         ## Stores a string of vowels in a variable.

store(consonants) "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"      ## Stores a string of consonants in a variable.

begin_group                                 ## Starts a group.
