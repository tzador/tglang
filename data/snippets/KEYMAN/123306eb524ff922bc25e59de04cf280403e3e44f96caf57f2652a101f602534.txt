+ [bam] store(&km_keyboard, u'basic_keyboard') 

This code snippet creates a new keyboard, named "basic_keyboard", and stores it for later use.

The first parameter specifies the variable or object to store the keyboard in, in this case the variable "km_keyboard".
The second parameter is the name of the keyboard, in this case "basic_keyboard" enclosed in single quotes.
