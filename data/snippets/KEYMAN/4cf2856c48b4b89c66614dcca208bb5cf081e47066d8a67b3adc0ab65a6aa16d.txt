This code snippet is a sample keyboard layout created using KEYMAN, a language used for creating customized keyboard layouts. The layout includes multiple rules and variables to define specific components and key mappings. It also uses context rules to insert special characters like stress marks and accent marks. The code is written in KEYMAN and can be executed to generate a custom keyboard layout.
