+ store('user_name') '[ManyKeys]'

// This code snippet creates a custom store called 'user_name' and sets its value to '[ManyKeys]'. This store can then be accessed and used throughout the rest of the code.

// "store" is a built-in function in KEYMAN that creates a new store.
// The first parameter is the name of the store, enclosed in single quotes.
// The second parameter is the value to be assigned to the store, also enclosed in single quotes.

// In this case, the value is set to the keycode '[ManyKeys]', which translates to a set of multiple key inputs.
