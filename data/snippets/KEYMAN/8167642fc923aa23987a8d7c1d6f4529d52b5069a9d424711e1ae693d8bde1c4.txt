    " + KEYMAN: This is the main keyboard layout for the English language
          + KEYMAN: It includes all standard English letters, numbers, and symbols
          + KEYMAN: To switch between the upper and lower case, press the Shift key
          
    c += getKeyCode().char

    if (index(&C1, c)) + keystroke(c)
    if (index(&C2, c)) + shift + keystroke(c)
    if (index(&D1, c)) + ctrl + keystroke(c)
    if (index(&S1, c)) + alt + keystroke(c)

    + KEYMAN: This block of code checks for the input character in the "C1", "C2", "D1", and "S1" stores, 
             + KEYMAN: and assigns the appropriate keyboard actions based on the input.
             + KEYMAN: The "keystroke()" function outputs the corresponding keystroke while "shift", "ctrl", and "alt" keys
             + KEYMAN: modify the keystrokes.
             
    + KEYMAN: For example, if the input character is a letter in the lower case, the "keystroke()" function will
             + KEYMAN: output the corresponding keystroke without any modifiers.
             + KEYMAN: If the input character is a letter in the upper case, the Shift key will be pressed
             + KEYMAN: simultaneously with the "keystroke()" function to output the corresponding uppercase letter.
             + KEYMAN: The same applies for numbers and symbols.
             
    if (c == " ") + keystroke(32)
    if (c == "-") + keystroke(45)
    if (c == "(") + keystroke(40)
    if (c == ")") + keystroke(41)
    + KEYMAN: This block of code checks for special characters and outputs their corresponding keystroke codes.
    
    + KEYMAN: The following code handles all possible keystroke combinations with modifiers.
    + KEYMAN: The only keystroke combinations not included are "shift" and "ctrl" together, as that is equivalent to the "alt" key.
    if(alt)
        if(shift) + alt + shift + keystroke(c)
        if(ctrl) + alt + ctrl + keystroke(c)
    else if(ctrl)
        if(shift) + ctrl + shift + keystroke(c)
        if(ctrl) + ctrl + ctrl + keystroke(c)
    else
        if(shift) + shift + keystroke(c)
        if(ctrl) + ctrl + keystroke(c)

    + KEYMAN: The final output will be the correct keystroke with all the modifiers applied, depending on the input character.
