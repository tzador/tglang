The code snippet above is a set of KEYMAN rules that will replace any invalid characters with the corresponding valid character. Each rule starts with the `+Use(n)` command, indicating that we want to replace invalid characters for the character `n`. Next, we use the `c(n)` command to specify the current character and the `&` symbol to indicate that we want to preserve the current character.

The rest of the rule uses the `>` symbol to indicate the replacement string. For example, in the rule `"c(1) $+ c(0) + "/" > "c(1)"`, we are replacing any instances of `c(1)` (the current character) followed by `c(0)` (any invalid character) and a `/` symbol with just `c(1)`, effectively removing the invalid character from the output.

We repeat this process for various invalid characters, such as `*`, `:`, `#`, etc. Each invalid character is replaced with the corresponding valid character, effectively sanitizing the input.

Lastly, we have a special rule for the character `c`, which will change the cursor position to the next character in the output. This is indicated by `c(1) + "change cursor position to the next character"`, where `c(1)` is the current character and the string is the explanation for the rule.

The end result is a set of complex KEYMAN rules that efficiently handle invalid characters and produce the desired output.
