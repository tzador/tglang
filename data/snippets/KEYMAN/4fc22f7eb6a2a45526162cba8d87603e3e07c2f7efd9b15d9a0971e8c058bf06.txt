+ store(NumRows) "1-9"

This code snippet is used to create a store in Keyman, which can store a set of characters that can be used in the keyboard layout.

To start, we use the "+" symbol to indicate that we are defining a store.

Next, we use the "store" keyword, followed by a name for our store, "NumRows".

Inside the parentheses, we specify the characters that we want to store, in this case, the numbers 1-9.
