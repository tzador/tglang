store(less than) "ᚠ"
store(greater than) "ᛠ"

+ [LT <] > "\\U+R140 >" + (context) 1
% This stores the unicode character for "ᚠ", the character for "greater than", and uses it to switch to a new context if the previous character was less than. The new context then prints the "greater than" character.

- [LT <] > "\\U+R141 <" + (context) 2
% Same as above, but for when the previous character was greater than.

+ any(numbers "1234567890") + [LT <] > "ᚠ́ >" + (context) 4 . + any(spacebar) > "ᛠ́ >" + (context) 5
% This context activates when any number is typed, and then checks if the previous character was less than. If it was, it prints the accented version of the "ᚠ" character. The next line checks for a spacebar and prints the accented "ᛠ" character if the previous character was less than.

+ any(spacebar) > "ᛠ >"
% This context simply prints the "ᛠ" character if a spacebar is pressed.

+ any(letter) > any(letter) + [GT >] "ᛠ ́ <" + (context) 6
+ (context) 4 > any(letter) + [GT >] "ᛠ́ >" + (context) 6
+ (context) 5 any(letter) + [GT >] "ᛠ ́ <" + (context) 6
% These three contexts check if the previous context was 4, 5, or 6, and if so, prints an accented "ᛠ" character and reactivates the same context. This allows for typing multiple accented characters in a row.
