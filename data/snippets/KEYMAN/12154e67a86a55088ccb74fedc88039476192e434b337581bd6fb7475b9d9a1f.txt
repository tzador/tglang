With this code snippet, we are creating a basic store of vowels, as well as two additional stores using a wildcard symbol and a range of characters. Then, we are creating stores for uppercase and lowercase letters.

The '+' sign indicates the start of a rule. In this rule, we are using the context index to find the position of the first uppercase letter in the string, and then using that as the starting point for a context index within the lowercase letters. This rule will find all uppercase letters and move them to the index of the next lowercase letter.

Output: `'^' + any(upperset) > context index(lower set) + any(upperset)`
