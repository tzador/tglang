This code snippet in KEYMAN allows for variable storage and manipulation based on user input. It first stores the letters of the alphabet in a variable '&Chars' and the special characters in another variable '&SpecialChars'. 
Next, it checks the trigger value and assigns a value to '&FirstChar' and '&SecondChar' based on the condition. 
Finally, it checks if the index of '&SecondChar' in the concatenated deleted values of '&Chars' and '&SpecialChars' is greater than the index of '&FirstChar' in the deleted value of '&Chars'. 
If this condition is met, it enables support for cursive and numerals in KEYMAN.
