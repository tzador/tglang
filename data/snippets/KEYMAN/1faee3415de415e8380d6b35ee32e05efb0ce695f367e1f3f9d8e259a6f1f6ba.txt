// This code snippet is for a KEYMAN keyboard layout, using the + use() function to define a new keyboard layout.
// Inside the function, we have a ^ save() command, which saves the specified key combination (in this case, Ctrl+S) for later use.
// Within the ^ save() command, we set the context to "Any", meaning that the key combination can be used in any context.
// Next, we have the output() command, which specifies the keys to be output when the saved key combination is pressed.
// Inside the output() command, we use the = use() function again, this time defining a new layout for the "Brass" context.
// Within the = use() function, we have several : commands, which define key combinations and the keys to be output when those combinations are pressed.
// In this case, we have defined that pressing shift+3 will output a left curly bracket, shift+4 will output a right curly bracket, and shift+5 will output a pipe symbol.
// This creates a custom layout for the "Brass" context, which can be activated by pressing Ctrl+S.
