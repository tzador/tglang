// This code snippet creates a Person class with properties for name, age, and height

class Person(
    val name: String,       // stores the name of the person as a string value
    val age: Int,           // stores the age of the person as an integer value
    val height: Double      // stores the height of the person as a double value, representing meters
) {
    fun introduceMyself() {  // creates a function that will introduce the person
        println("Hi, my name is $name and I am $age years old. I am $height meters tall.")
    }
}

// creates an instance of the Person class with the given values for name, age, and height
val person1 = Person("Jane", 25, 1.68)

// calls the introduceMyself function on the person1 instance, prints out the introduction
person1.introduceMyself()
