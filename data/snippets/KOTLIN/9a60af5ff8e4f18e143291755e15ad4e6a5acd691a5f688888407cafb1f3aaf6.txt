// This code snippet uses the concept of higher order functions to manipulate a list of integers
// It filters out even numbers, maps them to their square and then reduces them by summing them up

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) // creates a list of integers
val result = numbers // assigns the list to a variable
    .filter { it % 2 == 0 } // creates a higher order function to filter out even numbers
    .map { it * it } // creates a higher order function to square each number
    .reduce { acc, i -> acc + i } // creates a higher order function to sum up all the numbers
println(result) // prints the result of the higher order functions (which is 220)
