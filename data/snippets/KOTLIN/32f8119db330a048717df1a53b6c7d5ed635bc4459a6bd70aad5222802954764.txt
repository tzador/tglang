//This code snippet creates a coroutine that calculates the sum of two numbers

//Declaring variables to hold the two numbers
val num1 = 10
val num2 = 20

//Creating a coroutine 
val sumCoroutine = GlobalScope.launch {
    //Using the `delay` function to simulate network call or any other long running operation
    delay(1000)

    //Calculating the sum of the two numbers
    val sum = num1 + num2

    //Printing the result
    println("Sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum")
}

//Launching the coroutine
sumCoroutine.start()
