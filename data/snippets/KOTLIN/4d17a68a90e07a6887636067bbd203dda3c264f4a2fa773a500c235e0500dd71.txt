//A function that returns the Fibonacci series up to a given number

fun fibonacci(number: Int): List<Int> {
    var result = mutableListOf(0, 1) //initializes the first two numbers of the series to 0 and 1
    var nextNum = 1
    while (nextNum < number) { //loops until the next number is equal to or greater than the given number
        nextNum = result[result.size - 2] + result[result.size - 1] //calculates the next number in the series by adding the last two numbers
        result.add(nextNum) //adds the next number to the result list
    }
    return result
}

//Example usage
println(fibonacci(10)) //outputs [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
