Explanation:
1. The code defines a function called `factorial` that takes in an integer `number` as a parameter and returns an integer.
2. The `if` statement checks for the base case - if the input number is 0, the function returns the value 1.
3. The `else` statement is the recursive case, where the function calls itself with the `number` parameter decreased by 1 and multiplies it with the current `number` value.
4. After defining the function, the code prompts the user for input and reads it using the `readLine()` function, which returns a string.
5. The `!!` operator is used to secure the non-null type of the `input` variable.
6. The `toInt()` function is used to convert the input from a string to an integer.
7. The `factorial` function is then called with the input as an argument and its return value is stored in a variable `result`.
8. Finally, the result is printed to the console along with a string that includes the original input number for context.
9. This code uses recursion, which is a complex concept in programming, to calculate the factorial of a given number.
