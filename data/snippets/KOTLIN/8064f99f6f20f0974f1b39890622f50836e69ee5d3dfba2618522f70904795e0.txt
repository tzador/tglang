// This is a complex code snippet written in the Kotlin programming language

// Declare a data class named "Person" with properties for name and age
data class Person(
        val name: String,
        val age: Int
)

// Create an extension function to calculate the person's age in days
fun Person.calculateAgeInDays(): Int {
    return this.age * 365
}

// Define a list of Person objects
val people = listOf(
        Person("John", 32),
        Person("Jane", 28),
        Person("Mike", 45),
        Person("Sarah", 19)
)

// Use a higher-order function to filter the list and only return people under the age of 30
val youngPeople = people.filter { it.age < 30 }

// Use a for loop to iterate through the list and print the name and calculated age in days
for (person in youngPeople) {
    println("${person.name} is ${person.calculateAgeInDays()} days old")
}
