//This code snippet creates a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of only the even numbers in the list

fun sumOfEvenNumbers(numbers: List<Int>): Int {
    var sum = 0 //create a variable to store the sum
    for (num in numbers) { //iterate through the list of numbers
        if (num % 2 == 0) { //check if the number is even
            sum += num //add the even number to the sum variable
        }
    }
    return sum //return the sum of even numbers
}

/* Example usage:
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) //create a list of numbers
val evenNumbersSum = sumOfEvenNumbers(numbers) //call the sumOfEvenNumbers function and pass in the list
println(evenNumbersSum) //output: 30, which is the sum of even numbers in the list
