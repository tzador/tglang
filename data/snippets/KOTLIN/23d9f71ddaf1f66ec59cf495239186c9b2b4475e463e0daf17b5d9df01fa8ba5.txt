// This is a Kotlin code snippet

// Define a class representing a book with properties for title, author, and publication year
class Book(val title: String, val author: String, val publicationYear: Int) {

    // Define a function that returns a formatted string of the book's details
    // The function takes an optional parameter for the book's genre
    fun getDetails(genre: String = "Fiction"): String {
        if (genre == "Fiction") {
            // Use string interpolation to format the details string
            return "$title by $author, published in $publicationYear, is a $genre novel."
        } else {
            return "$title by $author, published in $publicationYear, is a $genre book."

// Create an instance of the Book class and store it in a variable
val myBook = Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", 1960)

// Call the getDetails function on the book and print the result to the console
println(myBook.getDetails()) // Output: To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, published in 1960, is a Fiction novel.
