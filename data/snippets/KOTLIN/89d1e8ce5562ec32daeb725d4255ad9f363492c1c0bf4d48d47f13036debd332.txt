//This is a complex code snippet in KOTLIN that utilizes classes, inheritance, and arrays
//First, we define our base class "Item" which will have a string variable "name" and a function "printName" to print it out
open class Item(val name: String){
    fun printName() {
        println("This item is called $name")
    }
}

//Next, we create a class "Weapon" that inherits from "Item" and has an additional variable "damage"
class Weapon(name: String, val damage: Int) : Item(name) {
    fun attack() {
        println("$name deals $damage damage!")
    }
}

//Then, we create a class "Armor" that also inherits from "Item" and has an additional variable "protection"
class Armor(name: String, val protection: Int) : Item(name) {
    fun defend() {
        println("$name absorbs $protection damage!")
    }
}

//Now, we create an array of "Item" objects, including one weapon and one armor
val items = arrayOf(
    Weapon("Sword", 10),
    Armor("Shield", 5)
)

//Finally, we loop through the array and call the respective functions depending on the type of object
for (item in items) {
    if (item is Weapon) {
        item.attack()
    } else if (item is Armor) {
        item.defend()
    }
}

//Output:
//Sword deals 10 damage!
//Shield absorbs 5 damage!
