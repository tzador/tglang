//[KOTLIN] Function to calculate factorial of a given number
fun factorial(num: Int): Int {
    var factorial = 1 //variable to store the factorial value
    if (num < 0) { //check if the number is negative
        return -1 //return -1 if number is negative (factorial not possible)
    }

        factorial *= i //calculate the factorial by multiplying with i
    }

}

//Example usage
val num = 5 //declare and initialize variable to store number
val result = factorial(num) //call factorial function with given number
println("The factorial of $num is $result") //print the result to console
