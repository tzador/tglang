//This code snippet shows how to use Kotlin's Functional API to manipulate collections.
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val squaredNumbers = numbers.map { it * it } //use map to square each element in the list
val evenNumbers = squaredNumbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 } //use filter to only keep even numbers
val sum = evenNumbers.reduce { acc, n -> acc + n } //use reduce to find the sum of the even numbers
println("The sum of the squares of even numbers in $numbers is $sum")
//Output: The sum of the squares of even numbers in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 20
