// This code snippet is a function that takes in a list of numbers,
// multiplies each number by 2, and returns the sum of the multiplied numbers
fun calculateSum(numList: List<Int>): Int {

    var sum = 0 // initialize sum variable
    for (num in numList) { // loop through numbers in the list
        sum += num * 2 // multiply each number by 2 and add it to the sum
    }
    return sum // return the final sum
}
// example usage:
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) // create a list of numbers
val sum = calculateSum(numbers) // call the calculateSum function
println(sum) // print the sum, which should be 30 since each number was multiplied by 2 and added together
