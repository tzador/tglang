// This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
fun factorial(n: Int): Int {
    if (n < 0)
        return -1 // factorial of negative numbers is undefined

    else if (n == 0)
        return 1 // factorial of 0 is 1

    else {
        var result = 1
        for (i in 1..n) {
            result *= i
        }
        return result // return the factorial of n
    }
}

// Main function to print the output
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val num = 5 //input the number whose factorial is to be calculated
    val result = factorial(num) //call the factorial function
    println("Factorial of $num is $result") //output the result
}

// Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
// Explanation: The factorial function takes in an integer as its argument and calculates the factorial using a for loop. The main function calls the factorial function, passing in the input number and prints the result. In this case, the factorial of 5 is 120.
