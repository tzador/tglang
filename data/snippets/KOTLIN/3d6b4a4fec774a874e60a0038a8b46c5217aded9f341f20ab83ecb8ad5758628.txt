//This is a sample Kotlin code snippet

//Declaring a class with two properties, a constructor, and a method
class Person(val name: String, var age: Int){
    
    //Method to print out the person's information
    fun printInfo() {
        println("Name: $name")
        println("Age: $age")
    }
}

//Creating an instance of Person class and calling the method
val person = Person("John", 26)
person.printInfo()
