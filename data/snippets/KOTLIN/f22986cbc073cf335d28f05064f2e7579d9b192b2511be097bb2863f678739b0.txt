// Define a function called "calculateAverage" that takes in two parameters, "num1" and "num2" of type Int and returns a Double
fun calculateAverage(num1: Int, num2: Int): Double {

    // Return the average

val names = listOf("Jane", "John", "Mary", "Alex")

// Using a for loop, print each name in the list
for (name in names) {

// Define a class called "Car" with two properties: "color" of type String and "year" of type Int

// Create an instance of the Car class

// Define a higher-order function called "runFiveTimes" that takes in a function of type () -> Unit as a parameter
