// This code snippet is a function that calculates the area of a triangle
// given the length of its three sides using Heron's formula

fun calculateArea(a: Float, b: Float, c: Float): Double {

    //calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle
    val s = (a + b + c) / 2

    //calculate the difference between the semi-perimeter and each side
    val x = s - a
    val y = s - b
    val z = s - c

    //calculate the square root of the product of the semi-perimeter and the differences
    val root = Math.sqrt(s * x * y * z)

    //return the area rounded to two decimal places
    return Math.round(root * 100.0) / 100.0
}

//example input
val area = calculateArea(4.0, 5.0, 6.0)

//expected output: 9.92
