// Here we define a function called "fibonacci" which takes in one parameter "num" of type Int and returns another Int value.
fun fibonacci(num: Int): Int {
    // If the input number is less than or equal to 1, then the result will be the same number.
    if (num <= 1) {
        return num
    }
    // Otherwise, we will use recursion to calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.
    else {
        // We will call the "fibonacci" function twice with the numbers (num-1) and (num-2) as parameters and store the results in variables "first" and "second".
        val first = fibonacci(num - 1)
        val second = fibonacci(num - 2)
        // Finally, we add the results of the "first" and "second" variables and return the result.
        return first + second
    }
}

// Here we call the "fibonacci" function and pass in the number 10 as the input.
val result = fibonacci(10)
// The expected output would be: 55
