//This code snippet is a function that calculates the area of a circle
fun calculateCircleArea(radius: Double): Double {
    val pi: Double = 3.14159 //constant value for pi
    val area = pi * radius * radius //formula for calculating area
    return area
}

//Example usage:
val radius = 3.5
val area = calculateCircleArea(radius)
println("The area of a circle with radius $radius is $area")
//Output: The area of a circle with radius 3.5 is 38.4849375
