//This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
fun factorial(num: Int): Int {

    //Base case, if the number is 0 or 1, return 1
    if (num <= 1) {
        return 1
    }

    //Recursive case, multiply the current number with the factorial of the number-1
    else {
        return num * factorial(num - 1)
    }
}

//Example of calling the function and printing the result to the console
val num = 5
val result = factorial(num)
println("The factorial of $num is $result")

//Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
