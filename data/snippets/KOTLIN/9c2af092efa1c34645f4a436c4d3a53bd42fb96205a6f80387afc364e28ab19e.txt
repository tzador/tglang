//Here is a complex code snippet in Kotlin

//Create an interface for a Shape class
interface Shape {
    fun calculateArea(): Double
    fun calculatePerimeter(): Double
}

//Create a Circle class that implements the Shape interface
class Circle(val radius: Double) : Shape {
    override fun calculateArea(): Double {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius
    }

    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {
        return 2 * Math.PI * radius
    }
}

//Create a Rectangle class that implements the Shape interface
class Rectangle(val length: Double, val width: Double) : Shape {
    override fun calculateArea(): Double {
        return length * width
    }

    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {
        return 2 * (length + width)
    }
}

//Create a Square class that extends the Rectangle class
class Square(side: Double) : Rectangle(side, side)

//Create a Triangle class that implements the Shape interface
class Triangle(val base: Double, val height: Double) : Shape {
    override fun calculateArea(): Double {
        return 0.5 * base * height
    }

    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {
        val hypotenuse = Math.sqrt((base * base) + (height * height))
        return base + height + hypotenuse
    }
}

//Create a list of different Shapes
val shapesList = listOf(
    Circle(5.0),
    Rectangle(4.0, 6.0),
    Square(3.0),
    Triangle(5.0, 4.0)
)

//Loop through the Shapes and calculate their area and perimeter
for (shape in shapesList) {
    println("The area of the ${shape.javaClass.simpleName} is ${shape.calculateArea()}")
    println("The perimeter of the ${shape.javaClass.simpleName} is ${shape.calculatePerimeter()}")
}

//Output:
//The area of the Circle is 78.53981633974483
//The perimeter of the Circle is 31.41592653589793
//The area of the Rectangle is 24.0
//The perimeter of the Rectangle is 20.0
//The area of the Square is 9.0
//The perimeter of the Square is 12.0
//The area of the Triangle is 10.0
//The perimeter of the Triangle is 15.0
