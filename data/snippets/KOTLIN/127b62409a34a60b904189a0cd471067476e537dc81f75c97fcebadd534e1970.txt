// This is a Kotlin code snippet that declares a function to find the factorial of a number recursively

// The main function that will be executed first
fun main() {

    val number = 5
    
    // Calling the function to find the factorial of the given number
    val result = factorial(number)
    
    // Printing the result
    println("The factorial of $number is $result")
}

// Function to find the factorial of a number recursively
fun factorial(num: Int): Int {
    // Base case - if the number is 0 or 1, its factorial is 1
    if (num == 0 || num == 1) {
        return 1
    } else {
        // Recursive call to find the factorial of the number - 1
        // For example, if the given number is 5, then the recursive call will be factorial(4)
        // This process continues until the number becomes 0 or 1, which returns 1
        // After that, the recursive calls will be resolved and the final result will be calculated
        return num * factorial(num - 1)
