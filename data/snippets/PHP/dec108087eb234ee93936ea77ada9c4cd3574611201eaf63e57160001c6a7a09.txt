<?php
// This is a complex code snippet that demonstrates the use of inheritance in PHP
// It creates a class called "Animal" with properties and methods
// Then it creates a child class called "Dog" that extends the "Animal" class
// The child class has its own additional properties and methods, while also inheriting the ones from the parent class

// Parent class
class Animal {
    // Properties
    protected $name;
    protected $color;

    // Constructor function
    public function __construct($name, $color) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    // Methods
    public function eat() {
        echo "{$this->name} is eating.";
    }

    public function sleep() {
        echo "{$this->name} is sleeping.";
    }
}

// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Additional properties
    private $breed;

    // Constructor function
    public function __construct($name, $color, $breed) {
        // Call parent constructor
        parent::__construct($name, $color);

        $this->breed = $breed;
    }

    // Additional method
    public function bark() {
        echo "{$this->name} the {$this->color} {$this->breed} is barking.";
    }

    // Override parent method
    public function sleep() {
        echo "{$this->name} the {$this->color} {$this->breed} is snoring.";
    }
}

// Create new instance of the Dog class
$dog = new Dog("Max", "brown", "Labrador");

// Call methods
$dog->eat();
$dog->bark();
$dog->sleep();

// Output: Max is eating. Max the brown Labrador is barking. Max the brown Labrador is snoring.
