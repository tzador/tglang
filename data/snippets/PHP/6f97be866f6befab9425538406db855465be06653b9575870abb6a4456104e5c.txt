/*
This is a complex code snippet in PHP.
It creates a variable named $numbers and assigns an array of numbers to it.
It then uses a for loop to iterate through the array and performs a mathematical
operation on each number, storing the result in a new array called $results.
Finally, it prints the contents of the $results array using a foreach loop.
*/
$numbers = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
$results = array();
for ($i = 0; $i < count($numbers); $i++) {
    $results[$i] = $numbers[$i] * 2; // multiply each number by 2
}

foreach ($results as $result) {
    echo $result . " "; // print each result followed by a space
}

// Output: 2 4 6 8 10
