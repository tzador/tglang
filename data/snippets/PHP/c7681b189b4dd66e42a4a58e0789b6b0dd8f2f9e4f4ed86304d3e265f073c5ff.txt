// This is a PHP code snippet that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of the even numbers from 1 to 100

$sum = 0; // variable to store the sum
for ($num = 2; $num <= 100; $num += 2) { // for loop to iterate through numbers from 2 to 100, incrementing by 2
    $sum += $num; // add the current number to the sum
}

echo $sum; // output the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100

/* Output:
2550
