/**
 * This code snippet uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number
 *
 * @param int $num The number whose factorial is to be calculated
 * @return int The factorial of the given number
 *
 * The recursive function takes the number and multiplies it by the result of the function called on the number-1.
 * This continues until the number is reduced to 1, resulting in the factorial of the original number.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: 5
 * Output: 120 (5*4*3*2*1)
 */

function factorial($num) {
    if ($num === 1) { // base case - when number is reduced to 1

    } else { // recursive case - when number is greater than 1
        return $num * factorial($num - 1); // multiply number with the result of the function called on (number-1)
    }
}

// Example usage:
echo factorial(5); // Outputs 120 (5*4*3*2*1)
