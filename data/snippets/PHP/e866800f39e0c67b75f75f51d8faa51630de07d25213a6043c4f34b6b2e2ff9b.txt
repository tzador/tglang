<?php 
// This is a long and complex code snippet in PHP
// First, we define a class called 'Car'
class Car {
  // The following properties are defined for a Car object
  public $make;
  public $model;
  public $year;
  public $color;
  
  // A constructor function is defined to set the properties upon object creation
  function __construct($make, $model, $year, $color) {
    $this->make = $make;
    $this->model = $model;
    $this->year = $year;
    $this->color = $color;
  }
  
  // A method is defined to display the car's information
  function displayCarInfo() {
    echo "This car is a " . $this->year . " " . $this->make . " " . $this->model . " in the color " . $this->color;
  }
}

// Now, we create a new Car object called 'myCar'
$myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", "2020", "red");

// We can use the 'displayCarInfo()' method to show the information of the car
$myCar->displayCarInfo();

// The output of the snippet should be: 
// This car is a 2020 Toyota Camry in the color red
