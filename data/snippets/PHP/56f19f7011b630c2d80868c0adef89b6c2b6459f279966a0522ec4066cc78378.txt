// This code snippet is a basic example of using a while loop in PHP.
// While loops are often used when we want to repeat a certain block of code while a condition is met.
// In this example, we initialize a variable $i to 1 and keep incrementing it by 1 until it reaches 5.
// The code inside the while loop will be executed as long as $i is less than or equal to 5.

$i = 1; // initialize variable i to 1

// while loop with condition $i is less than or equal to 5
while ($i <= 5) {
  echo "The value of i is: " . $i . "\n"; // print the value of $i
  $i++; // increment $i by 1
}

// Output:
// The value of i is: 1
// The value of i is: 2
// The value of i is: 3
// The value of i is: 4
// The value of i is: 5
