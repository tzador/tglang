<?php
// This is a complex code snippet that demonstrates the use of recursion in PHP

// Here we define a recursive function called calculateFactorial
function calculateFactorial($num) {
    // Base case: if the number is less than or equal to 1, return 1
    if ($num <= 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        // Recursive call: multiply the number with the factorial of the number minus 1
        return $num * calculateFactorial($num - 1);
    }
}

// Now we call the function and pass in a number to calculate its factorial
$factorial = calculateFactorial(5);

// Print the result
echo " Factorial of 5 is: $factorial";
