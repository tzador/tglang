// Example of a complex code snippet in PHP dealing with arrays and loops

// An array of fruits
$fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango", "grape"];

// An array of prices for each fruit 
$prices = [2.50, 3.00, 1.75, 4.00, 2.25];

// A variable to store the total cost
$total_cost = 0;

// Loop through the fruits array and print each fruit with its corresponding price
for ($i = 0; $i < count($fruits); $i++) {
    echo $fruits[$i] . ": $" . $prices[$i] . "\n";
    
    // Add the price of each fruit to the total cost
    $total_cost += $prices[$i];
}

// Print the total cost
echo "Total cost: $" . $total_cost . "\n";

// Check if the total cost is greater than $10
if ($total_cost > 10) {
    echo "Total cost is greater than $10";
} else {
    echo "Total cost is less than or equal to $10";
