<?php
// This is a PHP code snippet that generates a list of random numbers and sorts them in ascending order.
// First, we create an empty array to store the random numbers.
$numbers = array();

//Next, we use a for loop to generate 10 random numbers and add them to the array.
for($i=0; $i<10; $i++){
  $numbers[] = rand(1, 100);
}

//Now, we use the built-in sort function to sort the numbers in ascending order.
sort($numbers);

//Finally, we use a foreach loop to print out each number in the array.
foreach($numbers as $num){
  echo $num . "\n";
}

//The output will look something like this:
//12
//20
//26
//39
//51
//59
//62
//73
//84
//97

//Note: This is just one way to generate and sort random numbers in PHP, there are many other methods and functions that can be used.
