<?php
// This is a long and complex code snippet in PHP
// It includes conditional statements, nested loops, and variable assignments

// Define an array of numbers
$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Loop through the array and check if a number is even or odd
foreach ($numbers as $number) {
    if ($number % 2 == 0) {
        echo "$number is even\n";

        // Another loop to print all numbers smaller than the current one
        for ($i = 0; $i < $number; $i++) {
            echo "$i\n";
        }

    } else {
        // If the number is odd, assign it to a variable
        $oddNumber = $number;

        // Loop through the array again to find an even number to multiply with
        foreach ($numbers as $num) {
            if ($num % 2 == 0) {
                // Multiply the odd number with the even number
                $result = $oddNumber * $num;

                // Check if the result is divisible by 3
                if ($result % 3 == 0) {
                    echo "$result is divisible by 3\n";
                }
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

// Output:
// 2 is even
// 0
// 1
// 4 is even
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 10 is divisible by 3
// 1 is odd
// 4 is even
// 12 is divisible by 3
