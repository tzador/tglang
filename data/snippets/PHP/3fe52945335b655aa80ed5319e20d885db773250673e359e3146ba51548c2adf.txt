// This is a simple PHP function that calculates the factorial of a given number
// It uses recursion to continuously call itself until the base case is reached
// In this case, the base case is when the input number is equal to 1
// The code includes comments to explain each step

function factorial($n)
{
    // Base case
    // If the input number is equal to 1, then return 1
    if ($n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Recursive call
    // If the base case is not met, then call the factorial function again with a smaller number
    return $n * factorial($n - 1);
}

// Call the factorial function and assign the result to a variable
$number = 5;
$result = factorial($number);

// Output the result
echo "The factorial of " . $number . " is " . $result;

// Output:
// The factorial of 5 is 120
