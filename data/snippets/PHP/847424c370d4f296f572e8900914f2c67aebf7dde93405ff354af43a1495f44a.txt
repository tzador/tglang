 * The function is named "sum" and uses a for loop to iterate and add each number.
 * @param int $num1 The first number to be added
 * @param int $num2 The second number to be added
 * @return int The sum of the two numbers

//example usage
echo sum(1, 10); //output: 55 - sum of numbers 1 to 10
echo sum(5, 15); //output: 120 - sum of numbers 5 to 15
echo sum(10, 20); //output: 165 - sum of numbers 10 to 20
