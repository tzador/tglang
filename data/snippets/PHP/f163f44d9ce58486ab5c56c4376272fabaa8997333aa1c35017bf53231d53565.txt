<?php
/*
This is a complex code snippet in PHP.
It consists of a class and methods that perform various mathematical operations.
The class is named "Math" and it has three properties: x, y, and result.
The __construct() method takes in two arguments, x and y, and assigns them to the respective properties.
The "add" method takes in a parameter, $num, adds it to the property x, and returns the result.
The "subtract" method takes in a parameter, $num, subtracts it from the property y, and returns the result.
The "multiply" method takes in a parameter, $num, multiplies it with the property x, and returns the result.
The "divide" method takes in a parameter, $num, divides it from the property y, and returns the result.

// Creating an instance of the Math class
$math = new Math(10, 5);

// Calling the add method and passing in a number as the parameter
echo $math->add(2); // Output: 12

// Calling the subtract method and passing in a number as the parameter
echo $math->subtract(3); // Output: 2

// Calling the multiply method and passing in a number as the parameter
echo $math->multiply(5); // Output: 50

// Calling the divide method and passing in a number as the parameter
echo $math->divide(2); // Output: 2
