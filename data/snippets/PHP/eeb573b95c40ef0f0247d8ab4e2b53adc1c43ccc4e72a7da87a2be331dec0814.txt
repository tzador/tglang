// This is a complex code snippet in PHP
// It uses multiple functions and variables to perform a variety of actions

// Define a function that takes in two numbers and returns the sum of the two
function add($num1, $num2){
    return $num1 + $num2;
}

// Define a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the average
function calculateAvg($numbers){
    // Declare a variable to keep track of the sum of the numbers
    $sum = 0;

    // Loop through the array and add each number to the sum variable
    foreach($numbers as $num){
        $sum += $num;
    }

    // Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the array
    $avg = $sum / count($numbers);

    return $avg;
}

// Create an array of numbers
$numbers = [3, 7, 12, 8, 5];

// Call the add function and store the result in a variable
$result = add(10, 20);

// Print the result
echo "The sum of 10 and 20 is: " . $result . "\n";

// Call the calculateAvg function and pass in the numbers array as an argument
$avg = calculateAvg($numbers);

// Print the average
echo "The average of the numbers array is: " . $avg . "\n";
