// This is a complex code snippet in PHP
// It uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10

for($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) { // initialize i at 1, print numbers as long as i is equal or less than 10, increment i by 1 after every iteration
  echo $i . "<br>"; // print the number followed by a line break using the echo statement
}
