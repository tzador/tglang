// Create an array of numbers
$numbers = array(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9);

// Create a function to perform operations on each number
function operations($num){
  // Multiply by 2
  $num *= 2;
  // Subtract 3
  $num -= 3;
  // Add 5
  $num += 5;

// Create an empty array to store the results

// Loop through the numbers array and call the operations function on each number
foreach($numbers as $number){

  $results[] = operations($number);
}

// Print out the results
print_r($results);

// Output: Array ( [0] => 4 [1] => 5 [2] => 7 [3] => 9 [4] => 11 [5] => 13 [6] => 15 [7] => 17 [8] => 19 )
