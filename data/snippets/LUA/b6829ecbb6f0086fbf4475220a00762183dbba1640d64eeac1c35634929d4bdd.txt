This is a multi-line comment in LUA that explains the purpose of this code snippet.
The code below creates a function called 'fibonacci' that takes in a number 'n' as its parameter and outputs
the corresponding fibonacci sequence up to that number.

-- Define the fibonacci function
function fibonacci(n)
    -- Initialize the sequence array with the first two numbers of the sequence
    local sequence = {0, 1}

    -- Loop through all numbers between 2 and the input number 'n'
    for i = 2, n do
        -- Calculate the next number in the fibonacci sequence by adding the previous two numbers
        local next_number = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2]

        -- Add the next number to the sequence array
        table.insert(sequence, next_number)
    end

    -- Return the complete fibonacci sequence as a string
    return table.concat(sequence, ", ")
end

-- Print the fibonacci sequence up to the number 10
print(fibonacci(10))
-- Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
