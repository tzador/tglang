--[[
The code above creates a function called "calculateSquare" that takes in a parameter, "number."
Within the function, it multiplies the parameter by itself to calculate the square and then returns the calculated value.
The "print" statement outside of the function calls the function with a given input (in this case, 5) and prints the result.
The last lines are used to provide explanatory comments in annotated markdown code, which are enclosed in a set of triple square brackets.
