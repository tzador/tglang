--- Function to calculate the factorial of a number
function factorial(num)
    if num == 0 then
        return 1 -- base case, factorial of 0 is 1
    else
        return num * factorial(num-1) -- recursive call to calculate factorial
    end
end

print(factorial(5)) -- prints the factorial of 5, which is 120 
-- output: 120
