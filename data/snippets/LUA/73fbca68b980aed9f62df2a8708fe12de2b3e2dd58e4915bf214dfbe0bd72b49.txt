-- This function recursively calculates a Fibonacci sequence
-- @param n the number of Fibonacci numbers to be calculated
-- @return a table containing the calculated numbers
function fibonacci(n)
    -- initialize the first two numbers in the sequence
    local fib = {0, 1}
    -- loop through all numbers up to the desired amount
    for i = 3, n do
        -- calculate the next number by adding the previous two
        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]
    end
    -- return the calculated numbers
    return fib
end

-- call the fibonacci function with 10 as the input
local sequence = fibonacci(10)
-- print out the sequence
print("Fibonacci sequence with 10 numbers:")
print(table.concat(sequence, ", ")) -- output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
