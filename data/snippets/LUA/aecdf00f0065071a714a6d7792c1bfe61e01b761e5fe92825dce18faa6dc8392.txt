--This is a function that calculates the fibonacci sequence
--Input: n, the number of terms in the sequence
--Output: the fibonacci sequence up to the nth term

function fib(n)
    --Create a table to store the sequence
    local sequence = {0, 1}
    
    --Loop n-2 times to calculate each term of the sequence
    for i=3, n do
        --Calculate the next term by summing the last 2 terms
        local next_term = sequence[i-2] + sequence[i-1]
        
        --Add the next term to the end of the sequence table
        table.insert(sequence, next_term)
    end
    
    --Return the entire sequence table
    return sequence
end

--To test the function, we can print out the first 10 terms of the sequence
print("First 10 terms of fibonacci sequence:")
--Call the fib function with input of 10
local seq = fib(10)

--Loop through the sequence table and print out each term 
for i=1, #seq do
    print(seq[i])
end

--Output:
First 10 terms of fibonacci sequence:
0
1
1
