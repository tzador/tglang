--- This function receives two parameters, a number and a string
--- and returns a table with the number as the key and the string as the value
function generateTable(number, string)

    --- Initialize an empty table
    local myTable = {}

    --- Insert the number as the key and the string as the value
    myTable[number] = string

    --- Loop through the table and add additional key-value pairs
    for i = 1, number do
        if i % 2 == 0 then  --- If the index is even, add a string with "even" prefix
            myTable[i] = "even " .. myTable[number]
        else  --- If the index is odd, add a string with "odd" prefix
            myTable[i] = "odd " .. myTable[number]
        end
    end

    --- Return the final table
    return myTable
end

--- Example function call
generateTable(4, "Hello") --- Returns {4 = "Hello", 1 = "odd Hello", 2 = "even Hello", 3 = "odd Hello", 4 = "even Hello"}
