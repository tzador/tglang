-- This is a recursive function in LUA that finds the factorial of a given number
-- It takes in a number as an argument and returns the factorial of that number

function factorial(num) -- defining the function
  if num == 1 then -- base case, factorial of 1 is 1
    return 1 
  else
    return num * factorial(num - 1) -- recursive call, multiplying current number with factorial of the number - 1 
  end
end

print(factorial(5)) -- calling the function with an input of 5, will return 120 (5*4*3*2*1)
