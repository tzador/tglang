-- This code snippet creates a function for calculating the nth fibonacci number
-- Input: n (the nth number in the fibonacci sequence)
-- Output: the nth fibonacci number
function Fibonacci(n)
    -- Initialize first and second elements in the sequence
    local first = 0
    local second = 1

    -- Loop through fibonacci sequence until nth number is reached
    for i = 1, n do
        -- Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the first and second numbers
        local next = first + second
        -- Set the second number as the first number in the sequence
        first = second
        -- Set the next number as the second number in the sequence
        second = next
    end
    -- Return the final number in the sequence, which is the nth fibonacci number
    return first
end

-- Test the function with an input of 10
print(Fibonacci(10))
