--- This is a comment in LUA that explains the purpose of this code snippet
--- This snippet checks if a given number is prime or not
--- The function takes in a positive integer as an argument and returns a boolean value

--- Define a function that checks for prime numbers
function isPrime(number)
    --- A for loop that iterates from 2 to one less than the given number
    for i = 2, number - 1 do
        --- Check if the current number is divisible by any number in the range
        if number % i == 0 then
            return false  --- If it is divisible, the number is not prime, so return false
        end
    end
    return true  --- If the loop completes without returning false, the number is prime, so return true
end

--- Prompt the user to enter a number 
print("Enter a positive integer: ")

--- Get the user input as a string
local input = io.read()

--- Convert the string input to an integer
local number = tonumber(input)

--- Check if the given number is prime and print the result
if isPrime(number) then
    print(number .. " is a prime number")
else
    print(number .. " is not a prime number")
end
