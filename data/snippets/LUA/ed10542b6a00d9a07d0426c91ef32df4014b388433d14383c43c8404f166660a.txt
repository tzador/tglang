--- This program uses a for loop to print out the sum 
--- of all even numbers from 1 to 100.

--- Initializing a variable for storing the sum
local sum = 0 

--- Defining a function for calculating the sum
--- Takes in a starting and ending number as parameters
function calculateSum(startNum, endNum) 

--- Using a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers
  for i = startNum, endNum do 

--- Checking if the current number is even
    if i % 2 == 0 then 

--- Adding the even number to the sum
      sum = sum + i 
    end 
  end 

--- Printing the final sum
  print("The sum of even numbers from "  .. startNum .. " to " .. endNum .. " is: " .. sum) 
end 

--- Calling the function and passing in the range of 1 to 100 as parameters
calculateSum(1, 100)
