---[[ 
    This is a complex code snippet in LUA 
    It uses recursion to determine the factorial of a number
]]--- 

--- Define the function that takes in a number n 
--- and returns its factorial value 
function factorial(n)
    --- Check if the number is 0 
    if n == 0 then
        --- Return 1 if the number is 0 
        return 1
    else
        --- Otherwise, call the function recursively 
        --- with the number decremented by 1 
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
    end
end

--- Call the function with a sample number and print the result 
print(factorial(5))
