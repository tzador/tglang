--[[
This code snippet uses the 'Class' library to create a class called 'Vehicle'.
The class has attributes such as 'color', 'maxSpeed', and 'fuelType'.
It also has methods such as 'accelerate', 'brake', and 'refuel'.
]]--

--Load the Class library
local Class = require('class')

--Create the 'Vehicle' class
local Vehicle = Class{}

--Initialize the class with default attributes
function Vehicle:init()
    self.color = 'red'
    self.maxSpeed = 100
    self.fuelType = 'gasoline'
end

--Method to accelerate the vehicle
--Parameters: accelerationValue - the amount of speed to add
function Vehicle:accelerate(accelerationValue)
    self.maxSpeed = self.maxSpeed + accelerationValue
end

--Method to brake the vehicle
--Parameters: brakingValue - the amount of speed to decrease
function Vehicle:brake(brakingValue)
    self.maxSpeed = self.maxSpeed - brakingValue
end

--Method to refuel the vehicle
--Parameters: fuelType - the type of fuel to refuel with
function Vehicle:refuel(fuelType)
    self.fuelType = fuelType
end

--Example usage of the 'Vehicle' class
local car = Vehicle()
car:init()
car:accelerate(50)
car:brake(20)
car:refuel('diesel')

--Print the final attributes of the car
print(car.color, car.maxSpeed, car.fuelType)
--Output: red 130 diesel
