-- Define a table named 'students' with key-value pairs for student information
local students = {["John"] = {
    age = 18,
    grade = 9
},
    ["Rachel"] = {
    age = 17,
    grade = 12
},
    ["Michael"] = {
    age = 16,
    grade = 10
}
}

-- Define a function to calculate the average grade of all students in the table
function calculateAverageGrade(students)
    local sum = 0
    local count = 0 -- tracks number of students

    -- Loop through the table and add all grades to the sum variable
    for key, value in pairs(students) do
        sum = sum + value["grade"]
        count = count + 1
    end

    -- Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of students
    local average = sum / count

    -- Return the average grade
    return average
end

-- Print the average grade of all students
print("Average grade of all students: " .. calculateAverageGrade(students))

-- Output: Average grade of all students: 10.333333333333
