--- This function takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers
function sum(array)
    local total = 0             --- initialize a local variable to hold the sum
    
    for i=1, #array do         --- loop through each element in the array
        total = total + array[i]    --- add the current element to the total
    end
    
    return total               --- return the final sum
end

--- This table holds a 2D array of numbers
local numbers = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
}

local result = sum(numbers[2])  --- get the sum of the second row in the 2D array
print(result)                   --- print the result to the console

--- Output: 15
