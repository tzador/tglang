This is a multi-line comment in LUA.
It will be used to explain and document the following code snippet.
The code snippet is a function written in LUA that takes two parameters, x and y, and adds them together, returning the result.
--]]
 function add(x, y)

    This line initializes a local variable named sum, which will store the result of x + y.
    The sum variable is initialized with a value of 0.

    --[[ This is a for loop in LUA.
    It will iterate from 1 to x, adding the current value of y to sum in each iteration.

    --[[ This is an if statement in LUA.
    It checks if the value of x is equal to y.
    If it is, then the value of sum will be doubled.
