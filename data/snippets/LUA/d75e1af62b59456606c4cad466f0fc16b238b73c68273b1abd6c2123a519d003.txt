--[[
This is a long and complex code snippet written in LUA.
It uses a variety of built-in functions and control structures to perform a series of calculations.

The first few lines of code initialize variables and create a function for calculating the square of a number.

Each subsequent line performs a different calculation, using a combination of mathematical operators, conditional statements, and function calls.

The output of each calculation is printed to the console, along with some explanatory text.

Finally, the code ends with a loop that generates a random number and checks if it is divisible by 5.

If the number is divisible by 5, the loop terminates, otherwise it continues until a divisible number is found.

-- initialize variables
num1 = 5
num2 = 2
num3 = 7
num4 = 10

-- function for calculating square
function square(num)
    return num * num
end

-- calculate and print sum
sum = num1 + num2
print("The sum of num1 and num2 is " .. sum)

-- calculate and print product
product = num1 * num3
print("The product of num1 and num3 is " .. product)

-- calculate and print difference
diff = num3 - num2
print("The difference between num3 and num2 is " .. diff)

-- calculate and print quotient
quotient = num4 / num2
print("The quotient of num4 and num2 is " .. quotient)

-- use function to calculate square of num 1 and print result
square_result = square(num1)
print("The square of num1 is " .. square_result)

-- use conditional statement to check if num4 is greater than num3
if num4 > num3 then
    print("num4 is greater than num3")
else
    print("num4 is not greater than num3")
end

-- loop through random numbers until a number divisible by 5 is found
while true do
    -- generate random number between 1 and 100
    rand_num = math.random(1, 100)
    -- check if number is divisible by 5
    if rand_num % 5 == 0 then
        break
    end
