Another multi-line comment.
Here, we are defining a function that takes in two parameters,
performs arithmetic operations, and returns the result.

function calculateDiscountedPrice(currentPrice, discountPercentage)
  local discountedPrice = (currentPrice * (100 - discountPercentage)) / 100

In this code block, we are calling the function we just defined and printing the returned value
to the console.

local discount = 20
local originalPrice = products[1].price
local discountedPrice = calculateDiscountedPrice(originalPrice, discount)
print("The discounted price is: " .. discountedPrice)
