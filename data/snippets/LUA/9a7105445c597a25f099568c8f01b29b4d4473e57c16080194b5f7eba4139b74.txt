---[[
This is a complex code snippet in LUA demonstrating a function that calculates the power of a given number. 
It takes in two parameters, the base and the exponent, and returns the result.
Parameters:
- `base` - the base number 
- `exponent` - the exponent number
Returns:
- `result` - the result of the power calculation
]]
function calculatePower(base, exponent)
    ---[[ 
    The function uses a for loop to iterate through the exponent and multiply the base by itself each time. 
    It starts at 1 since anything to the power of 0 is 1.
    ]]
    local result = 1 

    for i = 1, exponent do
        ---[[ 
        The current `result` is multiplied by `base` each loop to calculate the new result. 
        ]]
        result = result * base 
    end 

    return result 
end

Example usage:
]]
print(calculatePower(2, 3)) ---[[ Outputs 8 as 2 to the power of 3 is 8 ]]
