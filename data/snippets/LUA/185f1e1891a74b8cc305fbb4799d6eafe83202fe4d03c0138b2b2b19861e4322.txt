-- This is a Lua program that generates a random sequence of numbers and sorts them in ascending order
-- Author: John Smith

-- Define a function to generate a random sequence of numbers
local function generateRandomSequence()
    -- Create an empty table to store the numbers
    local sequence = {}
    
    -- Use a for loop to generate 10 random numbers and add them to the table
    for i = 1, 10 do
        -- Generate a random number between 1 and 100
        local random_number = math.random(1, 100)
        -- Add the number to the table
        table.insert(sequence, random_number)
    end
    
    -- Return the generated sequence
    return sequence
end

-- Define a function to sort the sequence in ascending order
local function sortSequence(sequence)
    -- Use a nested for loop to compare and swap numbers in the sequence
    for i = 1, #sequence do
        for j = i + 1, #sequence do
            -- Compare the two numbers
            if sequence[i] > sequence[j] then
                -- Swap the numbers using a temporary variable
                local temp = sequence[i]
                sequence[i] = sequence[j]
                sequence[j] = temp
            end
        end
    end
end

-- Call the generateRandomSequence function and store the result in a variable
local randomSequence = generateRandomSequence()

-- Print the unsorted sequence
print("Unsorted Sequence:")
-- Use a for loop to iterate through the sequence and print each number
for i = 1, #randomSequence do
    print(randomSequence[i])
end

-- Call the sortSequence function and pass in the random sequence
sortSequence(randomSequence)

-- Print the sorted sequence
print("Sorted Sequence:")
-- Use a for loop to iterate through the sequence and print each number
for i = 1, #randomSequence do
    print(randomSequence[i])
end
