function printCharacters(str)
    local length = 0 -- Initialize length counter

    for i = 1, #str do -- Loop through each character in the string
        io.write(str:sub(i, i) .. "-") -- Print the character followed by a dash
        length = length + 1 -- Increment length counter
    end

    print() -- Print new line
    return length -- Return the total number of characters
end

-- Example call to the function
local str = "Hello World!"
local result = printCharacters(str)

print("The total number of characters in '" .. str .. "' is " .. result)
