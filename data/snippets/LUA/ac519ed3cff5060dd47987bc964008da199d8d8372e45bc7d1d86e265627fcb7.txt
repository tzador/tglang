-- Here we define a function that takes in a number and returns its square
function square(num)
    return num * num
end

-- Define a variable that stores the maximum value to be checked
max_value = 10

-- Create a loop that checks each number from 1 to the maximum value, and outputs the square of each number
for i = 1, max_value do
    -- Calls the square function and passes in the current number (i) as an argument
    local result = square(i)
    -- Prints the result in a human-readable format
    print("The square of "..i.." is "..result)
end
