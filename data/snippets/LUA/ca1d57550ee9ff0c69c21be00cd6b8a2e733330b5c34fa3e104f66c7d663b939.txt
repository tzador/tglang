--[[
    This program generates a Fibonacci sequence
    using user input as the length of the sequence
--]]

-- Initialize variables
local length = tonumber(io.read()) -- get user input and convert to number
local sequence = {0, 1} -- initialize sequence with first two numbers
local count = 2 -- keep track of the number of elements in sequence

-- While loop to generate sequence
while count < length do
    -- Calculate next number in sequence by adding previous two numbers
    sequence[count + 1] = sequence[count] + sequence[count - 1]
    count = count + 1 -- increment count
end

-- Print sequence
for i = 1, length do
    print(sequence[i])
end
