-- FUNCTION FOR CALCULATING FIBONACCI SERIES USING A LOOP

--- This function takes in a number 'n' and returns the Fibonacci series up to that number.

function fibonacci(n)
  -- Create an empty list to store the series
  local series = {}

  -- Initialize the first two numbers in the series
  series[1] = 0
  series[2] = 1

  -- Loop through the remaining numbers in the series
  for i = 3, n do
    -- Calculate the next number in the series by adding the two previous numbers
    series[i] = series[i - 2] + series[i - 1]
  end

  -- Return the created series
  return series
end
