-- Define a table with key-value pairs
local person = {
    name = "John",
    age = 26,
    occupation = "Software Developer"
}

-- Iterate through the table and print out each key and value
for key, value in pairs(person) do
    print(key .. ": " .. value)
end

-- Check if the person is eligible to vote based on their age
if person.age >= 18 then
    print("This person is eligible to vote.")
else
    print("This person is not eligible to vote.")
end

-- Add a new key-value pair to the table
person.location = "New York"

-- Print a formatted string using the person's information
print(string.format("%s is %d years old and works as a %s in %s.", person.name, person.age, person.occupation, person.location))

-- Output:
-- name: John
-- age: 26
-- occupation: Software Developer
-- This person is eligible to vote.
-- John is 26 years old and works as a Software Developer in New York.
