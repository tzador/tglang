This is a complex for loop that prints the first 10 fibonacci numbers

-- initializing the first two numbers of the sequence
local first_num = 0
local second_num = 1

-- using a for loop to calculate and print the first 10 fibonacci numbers
for i = 1, 10 do 
  -- calculating the current fibonacci number by adding the last two numbers
  local current_num = first_num + second_num
  
  -- printing the current fibonacci number
  print(current_num)
  
  -- reassigning the variables for the next iteration
  first_num = second_num
  second_num = current_num
end

-- Output: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
