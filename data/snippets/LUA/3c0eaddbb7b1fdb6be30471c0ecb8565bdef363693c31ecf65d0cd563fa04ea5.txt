-- Define a function that takes in two numbers as parameters
function calculate(x, y)
  -- Create a local variable that stores the sum of the two parameters
  local sum = x + y

  -- Create a local variable that stores the difference of the two parameters
  local difference = x - y

  -- Create a local variable that stores the product of the two parameters
  local product = x * y

  -- Print the results to the console
  print("The sum of " .. x .. " and " .. y .. " is " .. sum)
  print("The difference of " .. x .. " and " .. y .. " is " .. difference)
  print("The product of " .. x .. " and " .. y .. " is " .. product)
end

-- Call the function with the values 10 and 5
calculate(10, 5)

-- Output:
-- The sum of 10 and 5 is 15
-- The difference of 10 and 5 is 5
-- The product of 10 and 5 is 50
