-- Function to calculate the factorial of a number
-- Takes in an integer as input and returns the factorial of that number as output
-- Uses recursion to solve the problem

function factorial(num)
    -- Base case
    if num == 0 then
        -- If input is 0, factorial is 1
        return 1
    else
        -- If input is not 0, recursively call the function
        -- Multiply current input with the factorial of the previous input
        -- Returns the final result once all recursive calls have been completed
        return num * factorial(num - 1)
    end
end

-- Example function call to calculate the factorial of 5
factorial(5) -- Output: 120
