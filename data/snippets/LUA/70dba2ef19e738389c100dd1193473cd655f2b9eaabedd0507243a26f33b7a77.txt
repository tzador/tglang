--- This is a simple program that calculates the factorial of a given number
--- using a for loop and a recursive function

--- Function to calculate the factorial of a given number
--- @param n The number to calculate the factorial for
--- @return The factorial of n
function factorial(n)
    if n == 0 then
        return 1
    else
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
    end
end

--- Prompt the user to enter a number
print("Enter a number: ")
input = io.read("*n")

--- Calculate and print the factorial of the input number
--- using the factorial function
print("Factorial of " .. input .. " is " .. factorial(input))

--- Function to print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
--- @param n The number of Fibonacci sequence numbers to print
function fibonacci(n)
    first = 0
    second = 1
    for i = 1, n, 1 do
        print(first)
        next_num = first + second
        first = second
        second = next_num
    end
end

--- Prompt the user to enter a number
print("Enter a number: ")
input = io.read("*n")

--- Print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
--- using the fibonacci function
print("Fibonacci sequence:")
