---[[
This is a long and complex code snippet written in the programming language 'LUA'.
It uses multiple functions and variables to demonstrate different features of the language.

-- Define a function to check if a number is prime
function is_prime(num)
    -- Check if num is equal to 2 or 3, both of which are prime
    if num == 2 or num == 3 then
        return true
    end

    -- Check if num is divisible by 2 or is less than 2, both of which are not prime
    if num % 2 == 0 or num < 2 then
        return false
    end

    -- Use a for loop to check if num is divisible by any number from 3 to the square root of num
    for i = 3, math.sqrt(num), 2 do
        if num % i == 0 then
            return false
        end
    end

    -- If none of the previous conditions were met, then num is prime
    return true
end

-- Define a function to find the sum of all prime numbers in a given range
function sum_primes(start, finish)
    -- Initialize a variable to store the sum
    local sum = 0

    -- Use a for loop to iterate through all numbers in the given range
    for num = start, finish do
        -- Check if the current number is prime
        if is_prime(num) then
            -- Add it to the sum if it is prime
            sum = sum + num
        end
    end

    -- Return the sum
    return sum
end

-- Print the sum of prime numbers from 1 to 100
print(sum_primes(1, 100))
-- Output: 1060
