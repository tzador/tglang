-- Define a function that takes in two parameters
function calculate_area(length, width)
    -- Multiply the two parameters to get the area
    local area = length * width
    -- Print out the area with some additional text
    print("The area of the rectangle is " .. area .. " square units.")
    -- Return the area as the output of the function
    return area
end

-- Define a table (similar to an array) with multiple rectangles
local rectangles = {
    {length = 5, width = 10},
    {length = 3, width = 7},
    {length = 8, width = 4},
    {length = 2, width = 12}
}

-- Loop through each rectangle in the table
for i, rectangle in pairs(rectangles) do
    -- Call the function and pass in the length and width of the current rectangle
    local area = calculate_area(rectangle.length, rectangle.width)
end

-- This code will output the following:
-- The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.
-- The area of the rectangle is 21 square units.
-- The area of the rectangle is 32 square units.
-- The area of the rectangle is 24 square units.
