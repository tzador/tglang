-- Define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
-- Parameters:
--    input: The number whose factorial is to be calculated
-- Returns:
--    The factorial of the input number as an integer
function factorial(input)
    --- Check if the input number is 0 or 1
    if input == 0 or input == 1 then
        return 1
    end
    --- Initialize the result variable to 1
    local result = 1
    --- Loop from 2 to the input number
    for i = 2, input do
        --- Multiply the result by the current value of i
        result = result * i
    end
    --- Return the calculated factorial
    return result
end
