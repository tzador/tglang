-- Defining a variable that holds a string value
local greeting = "Hello World"

-- Defining a variable that holds an integer value
local age = 25

-- Using string concatenation to display our message
print(greeting .. "! I am " .. age .. " years old.")

-- Defining a function that takes in two parameters and returns their sum
local function sum(a, b)
    return a + b
end

-- Storing the result of the function call in a variable
local result = sum(5, 10)

-- Using string interpolation to display the result
print("The sum of 5 and 10 is ${result}") -- Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15

-- Defining a table (similar to an array in other languages) with string and numeric indexes
local fruits = {
    "apple", "banana", "orange",
    [5] = "grape", [10] = "pineapple",
}

-- Looping through the table and displaying each element using ipairs
for index, fruit in ipairs(fruits) do
    print("Fruit number " .. index .. " is " .. fruit)
end

-- Output:
-- Fruit number 1 is apple
-- Fruit number 2 is banana
-- Fruit number 3 is orange
-- Fruit number 5 is grape
-- Fruit number 10 is pineapple
