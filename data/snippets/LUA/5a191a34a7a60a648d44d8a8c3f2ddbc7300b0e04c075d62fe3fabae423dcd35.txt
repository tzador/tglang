-- Define a table to store player information
players = {}  

-- Create a function to add new players to the table
function addPlayer(name, score)  
  -- Create a new entry in the players table with the provided name and score
  table.insert(players, {name = name, score = score})
end

-- Call the addPlayer function to add a new player with name "John" and score 100
addPlayer("John", 100)

-- Create a for loop to iterate through the players table and print each player's name and score
for i, player in ipairs(players) do  
  print("Player: " .. player.name .. ", Score: " .. player.score)
end

-- Output:
-- Player: John, Score: 100
