  This is a code snippet demonstrating a complex function in LUA
]]

-- Define a function that takes in two numbers
function complexFunction(num1, num2)
  
  -- Check if the two numbers are equal
  if num1 == num2 then
    print("The numbers are equal")
  
  -- If they are not equal, perform mathematical operations
  else
    -- Get the sum of the two numbers
    local sum = num1 + num2
    
    -- Print the sum
    print("The sum is: "..sum)
    
    -- Get the difference between the two numbers
    local diff = num1 - num2
    
    -- Print the difference
    print("The difference is: "..diff)
    
    -- Get the product of the two numbers
    local product = num1 * num2
    
    -- Print the product
    print("The product is: "..product)
    
    -- Get the quotient of the two numbers
    local quotient = num1 / num2
    
    -- Print the quotient
    print("The quotient is: "..quotient)
    
    -- Get the remainder of the two numbers
    local remainder = num1 % num2
    
    -- Print the remainder
    print("The remainder is: "..remainder)
  end
end

-- Call the function with two numbers
