    A comment to explain the code below
    Creates a table with keys as strings and values as integers
    Each key has a corresponding value of its factorial, calculated using the function above

local table = {
    ["6"] = factorial(6),
    ["8"] = factorial(8),

-- Now we can access the factorial values of the numbers 6, 8 and 12 by using their corresponding keys in the table
print(table["6"])
print(table["8"])
print(table["12"])

    Output:
