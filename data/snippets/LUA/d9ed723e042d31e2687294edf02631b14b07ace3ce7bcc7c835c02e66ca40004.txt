-- Create a function that finds the square root of a number
-- using the Newton-Raphson method

-- Function takes in two parameters: the number to find the square root of, and the initial guess
function newton_raphson(number, guess)

    -- Get the difference between the guess and the actual square root
    local difference = guess * guess - number
    
    -- Initialize a variable for the new guess
    local new_guess = 0

    -- Use a while loop to iterate until the difference falls within a desired threshold of accuracy
    while math.abs(difference) > 0.0001 do
    
        -- Calculate the new guess using the Newton-Raphson formula
        new_guess = guess - difference / (2 * guess)
        
        -- Update the difference with the new guess
