-- Define a function called "max" that takes in two parameters, "a" and "b"
-- and returns the maximum of the two
function max(a, b)
    -- If a is greater than b, return a
    if a > b then
        return a
    -- If b is greater than a, return b
    elseif b > a then
        return b
    -- If a and b are equal, return a (or b, since they are equal)
    else
        return a
    end
end

-- Prints the result of calling the "max" function with 5 and 10 as the parameters
print(max(5, 10)) -- Output: 10
