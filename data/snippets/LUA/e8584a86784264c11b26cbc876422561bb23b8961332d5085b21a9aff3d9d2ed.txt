--- this line sets the value of a variable to 10 and declares it as an integer
local myVariable = 10

--- the function below checks if a given number is prime and returns a boolean value
--- parameters:
--- num - the number to be checked
--- returns:
--- true - if the number is prime
--- false - if the number is not prime
function isPrime(num)
    --- loop through all numbers from 2 to half of the given number
    for i = 2, num/2 do
        --- if the number is evenly divisible by the current number, it is not prime
        if num % i == 0 then
            return false
        end
    end
    --- if no numbers evenly divide the given number, it is prime
    return true
