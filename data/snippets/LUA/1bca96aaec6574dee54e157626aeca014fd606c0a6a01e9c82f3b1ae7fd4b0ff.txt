-- create a function that prints the given value n times

-- define a table with key-value pairs for fruits and their prices
fruits = {
    apple = 1.25,
    banana = 0.75,
    orange = 0.95
}

-- create a function to calculate the total cost for a given list of fruits
function calculateTotalCost(fruitList)
    local totalCost = 0
    
    -- loop through each fruit in the list
    for key, value in pairs(fruitList) do
        -- multiply the price of the fruit by the number of times it appears in the list
        totalCost = totalCost + value * fruitList[key]
    end

end

-- create a sample list of fruits to test the calculateTotalCost function
myFruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange", "apple", "orange"}

-- print the total cost of the fruits in the list using the calculateTotalCost function
print("Total cost for my fruits is $" .. calculateTotalCost(fruits))
