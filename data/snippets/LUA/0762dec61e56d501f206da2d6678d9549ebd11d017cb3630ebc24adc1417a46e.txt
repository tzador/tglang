--- This is a function called multiply that takes in two numbers as parameters
--- and returns the product of the two numbers
---@param num1 The first number to be multiplied
---@param num2 The second number to be multiplied
---@return The product of num1 and num2
function multiply(num1, num2)
    --- Initialize the result variable to hold the product
    local result = 0

    --- Loop through num2 and add num1 to the result variable each time
    for i = 1, num2 do
        result = result + num1
    end

    --- Return the result
    return result
end

--- Call the multiply function with 5 as num1 and 2 as num2
multiply(5, 2)

--- Output: 10
