-- Function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
-- Param num: The number up to which the sequence will be calculated
-- Returns: The Fibonacci sequence up to the given number in a table
function fibonacci(num)
    -- Initialize the Fibonacci sequence table
    local fib_sequence = {}

    -- Set first two numbers in the sequence
    fib_sequence[1] = 0
    fib_sequence[2] = 1

    -- Loop through the sequence, starting at index 3
    for i = 3, num do
        -- Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
        fib_sequence[i] = fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2]
    end

    -- Return the Fibonacci sequence table
    return fib_sequence
end

-- Call the fibonacci function and store the result in a variable
local sequence = fibonacci(10)

-- Print the sequence
print("Fibonacci sequence up to 10:")
for i = 1, #sequence do
    print(sequence[i])
