--This is a function that iteratively calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

--[[
Factorial Function
Input: x, a positive integer
Output: x! (x factorial)
--]]

function factorial(x)
    -- Base case: if x is equal to 1, then the factorial is 1
    if x == 1 then 
        return 1
    end
    
    -- Recursive case: multiply x by the factorial of x - 1
    return x * factorial(x-1)
end

-- Input the number whose factorial needs to be calculated
number = 5

--Call the factorial function and store the result in a variable
result = factorial(number)

-- Print the result
print("Factorial of ".. number .. " is " .. result)
