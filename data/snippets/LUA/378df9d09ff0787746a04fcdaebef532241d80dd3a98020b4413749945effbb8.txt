-- This is a function that calculates the factorial of a number
-- It uses the recursive method to compute the factorial

local function factorial(n) -- Takes in one parameter, n, which is the number to calculate the factorial of
	if n == 0 then -- Base case, if n is 0, then the factorial is 1
		return 1
	else 
		return n * factorial(n - 1) -- Recursive call, multiplies n by the factorial of n-1
	end
end

-- Main program
io.write("Enter a number: ") -- Asks user for input
local num = io.read("*n") -- Reads user input as a number
local result = factorial(num) -- Calls the factorial function, passing in the user input
io.write("The factorial of " ..num.. " is " ..result) -- Outputs the result to the user
