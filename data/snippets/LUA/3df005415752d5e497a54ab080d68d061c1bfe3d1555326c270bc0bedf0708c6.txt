    In this case, we are declaring a table called "students" and populating it with 5 student names.
]]--
local students = {"John", "Emily", "Michael", "Sarah", "David"} -- Create a table called "students"
print("Student names:")
for i = 1, #students do -- Loop through the elements in the table using the '#' operator to get its length
    print(i .. ". " .. students[i]) -- Print the index followed by the name of the student
end

    This is another multi-line comment in LUA.
    We are now creating a function to add a new student to the table.
    The function takes in the table and the name of the student as arguments.
    It then uses the table.insert() function to add the new student to the table.
]]--
function addStudent(studentsTable, name)
    table.insert(studentsTable, name) -- Add the name to the students table using table.insert()
end
addStudent(students, "Rachel") -- Call the function to add a new student
print("Updated student names:")
for i = 1, #students do -- Loop through the updated table
    print(i .. ". " .. students[i]) -- Print the index and the updated student names
end
