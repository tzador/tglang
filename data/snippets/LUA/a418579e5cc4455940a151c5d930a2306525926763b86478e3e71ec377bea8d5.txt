     This is a long and complex code snippet written in LUA. 
     It generates random numbers and performs calculations using loops and conditional statements.
     It also includes comments and variable declaration.

    -- Use a conditional statement to check if the random number is even.

        -- If the number is even, perform some calculations.
        local result = random_num / 2
