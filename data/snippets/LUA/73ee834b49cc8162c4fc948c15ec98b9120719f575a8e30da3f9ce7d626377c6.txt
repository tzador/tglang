-- This code snippet creates a function that will calculate the average of a table of numbers
-- and return it, as well as printing the original table and the average to the console.

-- Function that takes in a table of numbers and calculates their average
-- Parameters:
--   table: the table of numbers
-- Returns:
--   Average of the table
function calculateAverage(table)
    local sum = 0
    for i=1, #table do -- loop through the table
        sum = sum + table[i] -- add each number to the sum
    end
    local average = sum / #table -- calculate the average
    print("Original table: ", table) -- print the original table to the console
    print("Average: ", average) -- print the calculated average to the console
    return average -- return the average
end

-- Example table
local numbers = {10, 25, 47, 63, 81}

-- Call the function and store the returned average in a variable
local avg = calculateAverage(numbers)

-- Print the average to the console using string formatting
print(string.format("The average of the numbers %s is %.2f", table.concat(numbers, ", "), avg))

-- Output:
-- Original table: 10, 25, 47, 63, 81
-- Average: 45.20
-- The average of the numbers 10, 25, 47, 63, 81 is 45.20
