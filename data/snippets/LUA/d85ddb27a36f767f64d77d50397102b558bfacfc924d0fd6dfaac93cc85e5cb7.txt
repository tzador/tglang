    This is a complex code snippet that uses various built-in functions and control structures.

    In this snippet, we create a table called 'inventory' that contains items and their corresponding prices.
    We then use a for loop to iterate through the items and print out each item and its price.
    Finally, we use an if statement to check if the price of the item is less than 10, and if so, we add a discount to the price.

-- Defining our inventory table
local inventory = {
    {"apple", 5},
    {"banana", 8},
    {"orange", 3}
}

-- Loop through the items in the inventory
for index, item in ipairs(inventory) do
    -- Print out the item and its price
    print(item[1]..": $"..item[2])

    -- Check if the price is less than 10
    if item[2] < 10 then
        -- Add a discount of 20%
        item[2] = item[2] * 0.8
    end
end

    Output:
    apple: $5
    banana: $8
    orange: $3

    After discount:
    apple: $5
    banana: $6.4
    orange: $3
