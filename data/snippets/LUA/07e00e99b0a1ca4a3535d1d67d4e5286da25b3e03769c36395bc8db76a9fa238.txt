Description:
This code generates the n-th term in the Fibonacci series using a recursive function.
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
The series goes like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

-- Function to calculate the n-th term in the Fibonacci series
-- Parameters:
-- n: the number of the term to be calculated
-- Returns:
-- the n-th term
function fibonacci(n)
    if n <= 0 then -- base case
        return 0
    elseif n == 1 then -- first term in the series
        return 1
    else -- recursive case
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) -- sum of the two preceding terms
    end
end

-- Get user input for the term to be calculated
-- Print the n-th term in the Fibonacci series
io.write("Enter the term number: ")
n = io.read()
print("The n-th term in the Fibonacci series is: " .. fibonacci(n))

Output:
Enter the term number: 7
The n-th term in the Fibonacci series is: 13
