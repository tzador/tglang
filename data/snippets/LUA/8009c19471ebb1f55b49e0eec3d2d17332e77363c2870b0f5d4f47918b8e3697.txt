-- Variable assignment
local num = 4 -- 'local' is used to declare a variable with local scope
local str = "Hello World!" -- Lua supports both single and double quotes for strings

-- If statement
if num == 4 then -- '=='' is used for comparison, '=' is used for assignment
	print(str) -- Prints "Hello World!" to the console
else
	print("The number is not equal to 4")
end

-- For loop
for i=1, 10 do -- 'i' is a loop variable, '1' and '10' are the starting and ending values
	print(i)
end
-- Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

-- While loop
local count = 0
while count < 5 do
	print("Count: " .. count) -- '..' is used for string concatenation
	count = count + 1
end
-- Output: Count: 0, Count: 1, Count: 2, Count: 3, Count: 4

-- Function declaration
function add(a, b)
	return a + b
end

-- Function call
local result = add(2, 3) -- Assigning the returned value to a variable
print("Result: " .. result)
-- Output: 5

-- Table (a.k.a. associative array in other languages)
local fruits = { apple = "green", banana = "yellow", orange = "orange" }

-- Accessing elements in a table
print("An apple is " .. fruits.apple) -- Output: An apple is green

-- Adding a new element to a table
fruits.strawberry = "red"

-- Looping through a table
for fruit, color in pairs(fruits) do
	print("A " .. fruit .. " is " .. color)
end
-- Output: A apple is green, A banana is yellow, A orange is orange, A strawberry is red
