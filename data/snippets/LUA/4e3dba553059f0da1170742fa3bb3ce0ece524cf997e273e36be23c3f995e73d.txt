-- Define a function to calculate the average of a list of numbers 
-- Takes in a table as input and returns the average as output 
function calculateAvg(numbers)
    local sum = 0      -- Initialize a variable to store the sum of numbers 
    for i,v in ipairs(numbers) do
        sum = sum + v  -- Add each number to the sum variable 
    end
    local avg = sum / #numbers   -- Calculate the average 
    return avg 
end

-- Create a table named "numbers" and populate it with numbers 
local numbers = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30} 

-- Call the calculateAvg function and store the output in a variable named "avg" 
local avg = calculateAvg(numbers)

-- Print the result to the console 
print("The average of the numbers is: " .. avg)

-- Output: The average of the numbers is: 17.5
