    OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN LUA

    The following code creates a class called "Shape"
    which has a constructor function to initialize its objects,
    methods to change its position and color,
    and a function to draw the shape on screen.

--]]

-- The "Shape" class
Shape = {
    -- The "x" and "y" coordinates of the shape
    x = 0,
    y = 0,
    -- The color of the shape
    color = "white"
}

-- The constructor function for the "Shape" class
function Shape:new()
    -- Create a new object
    local obj = {
        -- Set the value of "self" as the new object
        self = {
            x = 0,
            y = 0,
            color = "white"
        }
    }
    -- Set the metatable for the new object with the "Shape" class as its prototype
    setmetatable(obj, self)
    -- Return the new object
    return obj
end

-- The "move" method for the "Shape" class
function Shape:move(new_x, new_y)
    -- Update the "x" and "y" coordinates of the shape
    self.x = new_x
    self.y = new_y
    -- Print a message to show the new coordinates of the shape
    print("The shape has been moved to (" .. self.x .. ", " .. self.y .. ")!")
end

-- The "change_color" method for the "Shape" class
function Shape:change_color(new_color)
    -- Update the "color" property of the shape
    self.color = new_color
    -- Print a message to show the new color of the shape
    print("The shape has been changed to " .. self.color .. "!")
end

-- The "draw" function for the "Shape" class
function Shape:draw()
    -- Draw the shape on the screen
    print("Drawing a " .. self.color .. " shape at (" .. self.x .. ", " .. self.y .. ")!")
end

-- Create a new instance of the "Shape" class
local shape = Shape:new()

-- Call the "move" method to change the position of the shape
shape:move(10, 20)

-- Call the "change_color" method to change the color of the shape
shape:change_color("blue")

-- Call the "draw" function to draw the shape on screen
shape:draw()

-- Output:
--
-- The shape has been moved to (10, 20)!
-- The shape has been changed to blue!
-- Drawing a blue shape at (10, 20)!
