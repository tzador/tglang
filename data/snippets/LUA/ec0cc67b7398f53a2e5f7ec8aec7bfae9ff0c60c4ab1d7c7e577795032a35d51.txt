In this snippet, we will be creating a function that calculates
the factorial of a given number using recursion.
--]]
function factorial(num)
  --[[ 
  Check if the number is 0 or 1, since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.
  This is the base case for the recursion.
  --]]
  if num == 0 or num == 1 then
    return 1
  --[[ 
  If the number is not 0 or 1, then the factorial is calculated
  by multiplying the number with the factorial of the previous number.
  This is the recursive case.
  --]]
  else
    return num * factorial(num - 1)
  end
end

-- Call the function with a parameter of 5 and store the result in a variable.
fact = factorial(5)

-- Print the result.
print("The factorial of 5 is: " .. fact)

-- Output:
-- The factorial of 5 is: 120
