--- A function that checks if a word is in a given sentence. 
-- @param word The word to search for in the sentence.
-- @param sentence The sentence to search in.
-- @return Whether the word is found in the sentence or not.

--- A function that returns a randomly generated sentence.
-- @param nouns A table of nouns to choose from.
-- @param verbs A table of verbs to choose from.
-- @param adjectives A table of adjectives to choose from.
-- @param adverbs A table of adverbs to choose from.
-- @return A randomly generated sentence using the given words.

-- Example usage:
-- Generate a sentence using the given lists of words.

local adjectives = {"big", "happy", "red", "delicious", "old"}

-- Output the generated sentence.
