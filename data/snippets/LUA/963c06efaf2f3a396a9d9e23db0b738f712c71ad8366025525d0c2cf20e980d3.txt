--- This function reverses the given string using a recursive approach.
--- @param str string to be reversed
--- @return reversed string
local function reverseString(str)
    if #str <= 1 then            --- checks if string is empty or has one character
        return str               --- returns string (base case)
    else                         --- if string has more than one character
        return reverseString(   --- calls function again, with substring of original string
            str:sub(2)           --- substring with the first character removed
        ) .. str:sub(1,1)        --- appends the first character to the end of the reversed substring

print(reverseString("hello world")) --- prints "dlrow olleh"
print(reverseString("lua is awesome")) --- prints "emosewa si aul"
