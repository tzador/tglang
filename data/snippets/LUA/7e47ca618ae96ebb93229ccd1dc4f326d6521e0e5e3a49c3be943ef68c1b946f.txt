function factorial(n)
    --[[ This function calculates the factorial of a given integer.
        It uses a recursive approach, making use of the tail-call optimization.
        The result is stored in a variable "result" and returned at the end.
        
        Parameters:
        n (number): the number to calculate the factorial of
        
        Returns:
        result (number): the factorial of n
    --]]
    if n == 0 then
        return 1 -- base case, the factorial of 0 is 1
    else
        return n * factorial(n-1) -- recursive call, multiplies n by the factorial of n-1
    end
