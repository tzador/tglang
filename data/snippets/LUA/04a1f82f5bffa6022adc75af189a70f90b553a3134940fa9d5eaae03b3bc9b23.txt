-- This is a function that takes in a number and returns the sum of all the odd numbers within that range.
-- It's called with the number 10 as an argument, but you can change it to any number you want.
function sumOdd(n)
    local sum = 0 -- variable to store the sum
    for i = 1, n do -- loop through numbers from 1 to n
        if i % 2 ~= 0 then -- if current number is odd
            sum = sum + i -- add it to the sum
        end
    end
    return sum -- return the final sum
end

print(sumOdd(10)) -- prints the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 10 (25)

-- Output: 25
