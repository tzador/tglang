--[[ This is a long and complex code snippet in LUA. It will initialize a variable and print out the results.
    First, we declare a global variable called 'x' and set its value to 5. 
    Then, we define a function called 'printResult' that takes in a parameter called 'num' and prints it out.
    Next, we call the function and pass in the value of 'x' which is 5.
    Finally, we use a while loop to continuously update the value of 'x' until it reaches 10 and call the function again.

    Output:
    "The value of x is: 5"
    "The value of x is: 6"
    ... (until x reaches 10)
    "The value of x is: 10" ]]--

-- declare global variable x and set its value to 5
x = 5

-- define function printResult to print out the value of a given parameter
function printResult(num)
    print("The value of x is: " .. num)
end

-- call printResult function and pass in the value of variable x
printResult(x)

-- use a while loop to continuously update the value of x until it reaches 10 and call the printResult function again
while x < 10 do
    x = x + 1
    printResult(x)
end

-- output:
-- "The value of x is: 5"
-- "The value of x is: 6"
-- ... (until x reaches 10)
-- "The value of x is: 10"
