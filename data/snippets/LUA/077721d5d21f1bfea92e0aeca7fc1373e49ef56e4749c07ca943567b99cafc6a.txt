-- Define a global variable "x" with the value of 5
x = 5
-- Define a local variable "y" with the value of 10
local y = 10
-- Print the sum of x and y
print(x + y) -- Output: 15
-- Create a function that takes in two parameters and returns the sum
function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end
-- Call the function with x and y as arguments
print(add(x, y)) -- Output: 15
-- Create a table that stores a list of numbers
local numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
-- Loop through the table and print out each number
for i, number in ipairs(numbers) do
    print(number) -- Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
end
-- Create a conditional statement checking if x is greater than y
if x > y then
    print("x is greater than y") -- Output: x is greater than y
else
    print("x is less than or equal to y") -- Output: x is less than or equal to y
end
-- Create a while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10
local i = 1
while i <= 10 do
    print(i) -- Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
