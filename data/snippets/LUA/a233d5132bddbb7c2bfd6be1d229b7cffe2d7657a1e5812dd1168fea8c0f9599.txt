-- Define a variable to hold a list of numbers
local numbers = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}

-- Create a function to calculate the average of numbers in the list
local function calculateAverage(list)
    -- Initialize sum variable to hold the total sum of numbers in the list
    local sum = 0

    -- Loop through the list and add each number to the sum variable
    for _, num in ipairs(list) do
        sum = sum + num
    end

    -- Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list
    local average = sum / #list

    -- Print the average to the console
    print("The average of the numbers is " .. average)

    -- Return the average value
    return average
end

-- Call the calculateAverage function and pass in the numbers list as an argument
calculateAverage(numbers)

-- Output: The average of the numbers is 15
