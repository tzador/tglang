This is a long and complex code snippet in LUA 
that calculates the average of a list of numbers.

Input:
    - list: The list of numbers to calculate the average of

Output:
    - Average: The calculated average of the input list

-- Function to calculate the average of a list
function calculateAverage(list)
    local sum = 0 -- Initialize sum variable to zero
    local count = 0 -- Initialize count variable to zero

    for i = 1, #list do -- Loop through each element in the list
        sum = sum + list[i] -- Add the current element to the sum
        count = count + 1 -- Increase the count by one
    end

    -- Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements
    local average = sum / count 
    
    return average -- Return the calculated average
end

-- Example input list
local numbers = {12, 45, 32, 78, 99, 21, 86}

-- Calculate the average of the numbers list
local avg = calculateAverage(numbers)

-- Print the calculated average
print(avg) -- Output: 54.428571428571

-- Empty line to separate output from input
print()

-- Another example input list
local other_numbers = {5, 10, 15, 20}

-- Calculate the average of the other_numbers list
local other_avg = calculateAverage(other_numbers)

-- Print the calculated average
print(other_avg) -- Output: 12.5
