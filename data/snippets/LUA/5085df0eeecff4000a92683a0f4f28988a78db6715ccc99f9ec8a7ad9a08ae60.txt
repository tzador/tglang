-- A function that returns the factorial of a number
function factorial(n)
    if n == 0 then  -- base case
        return 1
    else
        return n * factorial(n - 1)  -- recursive call
    end
end

-- A table of numbers to calculate factorial for
numbers = {5, 8, 3, 10, 6}

-- A for loop to iterate through the table
for i, num in ipairs(numbers) do
    print("Factorial of " .. num .. " is " .. factorial(num))
end

Output:
Factorial of 5 is 120
Factorial of 8 is 40320
Factorial of 3 is 6
Factorial of 10 is 3628800
Factorial of 6 is 720
