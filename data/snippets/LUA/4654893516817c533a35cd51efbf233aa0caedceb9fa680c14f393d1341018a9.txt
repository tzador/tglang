-- This function checks if a given input n is a prime number by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to its square root and checking for any remainder.

function isPrime(n)

    -- Base case, 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
    if n == 0 or n == 1 then
        return false
    end

    -- Loop from 2 until the square root of n.
    for i = 2, math.sqrt(n) do

        -- If there is no remainder, n is not a prime number.
        if n % i == 0 then
            return false
        end
    end

    -- If no remainder was found, n is a prime number.
    return true
end

-- Loop from 2 to 20 and check if each number is prime.
for i = 2, 20 do

    -- If the function returns true, print that the number is prime.
    if isPrime(i) then
        print(i .. " is a prime number.")
    end
end

-- Output:
-- 2 is a prime number.
-- 3 is a prime number.
-- 5 is a prime number.
-- 7 is a prime number.
-- 11 is a prime number.
-- 13 is a prime number.
-- 17 is a prime number.
-- 19 is a prime number.
