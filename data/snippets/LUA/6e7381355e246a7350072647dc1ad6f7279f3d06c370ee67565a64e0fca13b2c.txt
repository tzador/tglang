In this code snippet, we will be creating a function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers
]]

function gcd(a, b) -- this is the function definition
    --[[
    a and b are two integers passed as parameters to the function.
    The function will return the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.
    ]]
    if b == 0 then -- if b is equal to 0, return a as gcd
        return a;
    else -- else, recursively call the gcd function with the values of b and the remainder of a/b
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    end
end

--[[let's take two numbers as input from the user to test our function
you can change these values to test different inputs
]]

local num1 = 36
local num2 = 18

-- now let's call our function and pass the input numbers as arguments
local result = gcd(num1, num2)

-- print the result
print("The Greatest Common Divisor of "..num1.." and "..num2.." is "..result)

-- Expected output: 
-- The Greatest Common Divisor of 36 and 18 is 18
