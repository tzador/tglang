-- First we define a table that contains information about a player
player = {name = "John", level = 50, health = 100, inventory = {}}

-- Next, we create a function that adds an item to a player's inventory
function addItem(item)
  table.insert(player.inventory, item)
end

-- Now we can call the function and add an item to the player's inventory
addItem("Sword")

-- We can also print out the player's info
print("Player name: " .. player.name)
print("Player level: " .. player.level)
print("Player health: " .. player.health)

-- Lastly, we can loop through the player's inventory and print out each item
print("Player inventory:")
for i, item in ipairs(player.inventory) do
  print(item)
end
