//This code snippet is an example of a class implementation in Objective-C

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

//Defining a custom class called "Person"
@interface Person : NSObject

//Initializing properties for the Person class
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *firstName;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *lastName;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSNumber *age;

//Declaring a method to display the person's information
- (void)displayInfo;

@end

//Implementation of the Person class
@implementation Person

//Implementing the displayInfo method
- (void)displayInfo {
    
    //Using string interpolation to combine the first and last name properties
    NSString *fullName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ %@", self.firstName, self.lastName];
    
    //Using a conditional statement to check if the person is of legal drinking age (21 in the US)
    if (self.age.intValue >= 21) {
        NSLog(@"%@ is of legal drinking age and their full name is %@", self.age, fullName);
    }
    else {
        NSLog(@"%@ is not of legal drinking age and their full name is %@", self.age, fullName);
    }
}

@end

//Creating an instance of the Person class
Person *person1 = [[Person alloc] init];

//Setting values for the properties
person1.firstName = @"John";
person1.lastName = @"Doe";
person1.age = @25;

//Calling the displayInfo method to print the person's information
[person1 displayInfo];

//The output should be: 25 is of legal drinking age and their full name is John Doe
