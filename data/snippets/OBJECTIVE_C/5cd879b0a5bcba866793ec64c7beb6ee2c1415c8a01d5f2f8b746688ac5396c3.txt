//This is a long and complex code snippet in Objective-C that creates a custom class called Person

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h> //Importing the Foundation framework

//Defining the interface for the Person class
@interface Person : NSObject

//Declaring properties for the Person class
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic) NSInteger age;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *occupation;

//Declaring the initializer for the Person class
- (instancetype)initWithName:(NSString *)name age:(NSInteger)age occupation:(NSString *)occupation;

//Declaring a method for the Person class
- (void)introduceSelf;

@end

//Implementing the Person class
@implementation Person

//Initializing the Person class
- (instancetype)initWithName:(NSString *)name age:(NSInteger)age occupation:(NSString *)occupation
{
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        _name = name;
        _age = age;
        _occupation = occupation;

//Implementing the introduceSelf method
- (void)introduceSelf

//Creating an instance of the Person class
Person *person = [[Person alloc] initWithName:@"John" age:30 occupation:@"Teacher"];

//Calling the introduceSelf method
[person introduceSelf];

//Output:
Hi, my name is John. I am 30 years old and I work as a Teacher.
