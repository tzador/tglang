//This is an example of a complex code snippet in Objective-C
//This code snippet creates a custom class called "Person" with properties and methods
//@interface declares the interface for the class
//@implementation defines the implementation of the class
//Properties:
@interface Person : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic, assign) int age;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *occupation;

//Methods:
- (void)sayHello;
- (void)introduceSelf;
- (int)getYearOfBirth;

@end

//@implementation section defines the functionality of the class
@implementation Person

//Method to print out "Hello"
- (void)sayHello {
    NSLog(@"Hello");
}

//Method to introduce self
- (void)introduceSelf {
    NSLog(@"Hi, my name is %@. I am %d years old and I work as a %@", self.name, self.age, self.occupation);
}

//Method to calculate birth year based on current year and age
- (int)getYearOfBirth {
    int currentYear = 2020; //change this to current year when using this code
    int birthYear = currentYear - self.age;
    return birthYear;
}

@end

//Example of how to use this class:
//Creating an instance of the Person class and setting its properties
Person *person = [[Person alloc] init];
person.name = @"John";
person.age = 25;
person.occupation = @"Software Engineer";

//Calling methods from the class
[person sayHello]; //Outputs "Hello"
[person introduceSelf]; //Outputs "Hi, my name is John. I am 25 years old and I work as a Software Engineer"
int birthYear = [person getYearOfBirth]; //birthYear will be set to 1995
