//This is a basic function that calculates the factorial of a given number recursively
//Inputs:
//int num - the number whose factorial to be calculated
//Output:
//int - the calculated factorial of the given number
-(int)calculateFactorial:(int)num{
    if (num == 0 || num == 1) //if number is 0 or 1, factorial is 1
        return 1; 
    else
        return num * [self calculateFactorial:num-1]; 
}
//Example call:
int result = [self calculateFactorial:5];
//result = 120, since 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
//Note: This function could also be implemented iteratively
