//This code snippet uses Objective-C, a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language used primarily for software development on Apple's OS X and iOS operating systems.

//Create a class called "Person"
@interface Person : NSObject

//Declare private properties for the person's name and age
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic, assign) int age;

//Declare a public method to initialize a Person object with a name and age
- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name andAge:(int)age;

//Declare a public method to print out the person's name and age
- (void)printInfo;

@end

//Implement the Person class
@implementation Person

//Initialize the Person class with a name and age
- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name andAge:(int)age {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        self.name = name;
        self.age = age;
    }
    return self;
}

//Print out the person's name and age
- (void)printInfo {
    NSLog(@"%@ is %d years old", self.name, self.age);
}

@end

//Create an instance of the Person class with a name and age
Person *person = [[Person alloc] initWithName:@"John" andAge:25];

//Call the printInfo method on the person instance
[person printInfo];

//Output: "John is 25 years old"
