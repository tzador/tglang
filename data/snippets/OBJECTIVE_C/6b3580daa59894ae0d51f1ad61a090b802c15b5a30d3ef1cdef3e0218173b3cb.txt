//This code snippet shows how to calculate the average of a list of numbers using Objective-C

//Create an NSArray with a list of numbers
NSArray *numbersArray = @[@3, @9, @5, @12, @2];

//Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the numbers
double sumOfNumbers = 0;

//Calculate the sum of the numbers using a for loop
for (NSNumber *number in numbersArray) {
    sumOfNumbers += [number doubleValue];
}

//Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total number of numbers
double average = sumOfNumbers / [numbersArray count];

//Print the result
NSLog(@"The average of the numbers is %f", average);

//Output: The average of the numbers is 6.200000
