# This code snippet is an example of creating and using classes in Objective-C
# The class represents a car and has properties for make, model, and year
# It also has methods for starting the car, accelerating, and braking
# To use the class, we first need to import the Foundation framework
# Then we can instantiate an instance of the car and use its methods
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

// Defining the Car class
@interface Car : NSObject

// Defining the properties of the car
@property NSString *make;
@property NSString *model;
@property int year;

// Defining the methods of the car
-(void)startCar;
-(void)accelerateWithSpeed:(int)speed;
-(void)brake;

@end

// Implementing the Car class
@implementation Car

// Implementing the startCar method
-(void)startCar {
    NSLog(@"The %@ %@ has been started!", self.make, self.model);
}

// Implementing the accelerateWithSpeed method
-(void)accelerateWithSpeed:(int)speed {
    NSLog(@"The %@ %@ is accelerating to %d mph!", self.make, self.model, speed);
}

// Implementing the brake method
-(void)brake {
    NSLog(@"The %@ %@ has stopped!", self.make, self.model);
}
