; This is a comment
[Section] ; This is a section
; Key-value pairs are defined with '='
Key1 = Value1 ; This is a key-value pair
Key2 = Value2 ; This is another key-value pair

; Sections can have subsections
[Subsection]
Subkey1 = Subvalue1 ; Subkey-value pair within subsection

; Values can contain special characters and strings
Key3 = "This is a string with special characters !@#$%^&*"

; Keys can also have multiple values separated by '|'
Key4 = Value4a|Value4b|Value4c

; Values can be overridden by sections or subsections
; For example, Key1 is defined in both [Section] and [Subsection]
; The value from [Subsection] will override the value from [Section]
Key1 = Subvalue1 ; This is the overridden value for Key1
