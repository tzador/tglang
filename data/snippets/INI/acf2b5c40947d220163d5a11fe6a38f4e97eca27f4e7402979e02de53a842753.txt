[Section2]
keyA=This is a long string that could potentially cause problems in the INI parsing process. Therefore, it is important to properly handle and escape special characters such as quotes ("), equals signs (=), and semicolons (;).

keyB=Yes or No? //This is another comment

[Section3]
keyX=1.234e-03
keyY=4.56e+07
