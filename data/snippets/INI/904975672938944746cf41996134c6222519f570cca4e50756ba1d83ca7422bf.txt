; Example INI configuration file
; Comments start with a semi-colon and are ignored by the parser

; Sections are defined with a name enclosed in square brackets
[section1]

; Key-value pairs are defined using an equals sign
key1 = value1

; Values can be strings, numbers or booleans
key2 = "This is a string"
key3 = 100
key4 = true

; Sections can have nested subsections
[section1.nested1]

; Comments can also be included in the same line as the key-value pair
key5 = value5 ; This is a comment

; Multiple values can be assigned to a single key using an array syntax
key6[] = value6a
key6[] = value6b
key6[] = value6c

; Spaces around the equals sign are ignored
key7= value7
key8 =value8

; Values can also be enclosed in quotes if they contain spaces
key9 = "Value with spaces"

; Values can also be referenced from other sections using the ${section:key} syntax
key10 = ${section1:key1}

; Sections and values can be duplicated, but the last occurrence will be used
duplicate_section[section1]

duplicate_key = value1

; INI files can also use escape characters for special characters
key_with_escape = "This \"string\" contains escape characters"
