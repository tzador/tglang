; This is a sample INI configuration file
;
;
; An INI file is a configuration file format, used primarily on Windows platforms, that consists of a text-based structured file with a basic syntax for storing key-value pairs. 
;
; The basic structure of an INI file includes sections, which are encapsulated in square brackets, and key-value pairs separated by an equals sign (=). 
; Comments can also be included in the file using the semicolon symbol (;) at the beginning of the line. 
; This allows users to add annotations and descriptions for each section and key-value pair.
; Here is a sample INI configuration file with different sections and key-value pairs:

; [General] section contains general application information
[General]
AppName=MyApp
Version=1.0

; [Database] section contains database connection details
[Database]
Server=127.0.0.1
Port=3306
Username=user
Password=pass

; [UI] section contains UI customization options
