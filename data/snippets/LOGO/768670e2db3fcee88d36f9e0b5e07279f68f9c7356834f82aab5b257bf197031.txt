;This code snippet generates a series of concentric circles using the repeat and circle procedures in LOGO

;Set the starting position at (0,0) and the pen color to green
penup
setposition 0 0
setpencolor 50 200 50
pendown

;Define the procedure for drawing a single circle with radius 50
to circle
  repeat 360 [forward 1 right 1]
end

;For loop to generate 10 concentric circles with increasing radius
for [i 1 10 1] [
  circle ;call the circle procedure
  setpensize i ;increase pen size for each circle
  penup ;lift pen up to avoid drawing connecting lines
  right 90 ;turn right 90 degrees
  forward i*10 ;move forward to center of next circle
  left 90 ;turn left 90 degrees
  pendown ;put pen back down to draw next circle
