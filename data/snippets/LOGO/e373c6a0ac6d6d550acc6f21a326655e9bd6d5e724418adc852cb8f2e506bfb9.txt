; This code snippet creates a spiral shape using the Logo programming language
; The process is based on repeatedly drawing lines of increasing length and 
; rotating the turtle by a constant angle

; Defining variables and setting initial values
make "angle 30
make "length 10
make "iterations 20

; Defining a recursive procedure to draw each line
to draw-lines :count
  ; Base case to stop recursion when the number of iterations is reached
  ifelse :count = 0 [
    stop
  ] [
    ; Drawing the line of current length and rotating the turtle
    forward :length 
    right :angle

    ; Decreasing the angle and increasing the length for the next line
    make "angle :angle - 1
    make "length :length + 5

    ; Recursively calling the procedure with a decremented count
    draw-lines :count - 1
  ]
end

; Calling the recursive procedure to draw the spiral
draw-lines :iterations
