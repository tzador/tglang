; This code snippet creates a function that draws a spiral in the turtle graphics window
TO drawSpiral
  REPEAT 100 [
    FD :rep * 5 ; Move forward by the value of :rep times 5
    RT 90 ; Rotate the turtle right by 90 degrees
    SET rep :rep + 1 ; Increment the value of :rep by 1
  ]
END

; This code snippet initializes the value of :rep to 1 and calls the drawSpiral function
MAKE "rep 1
