; This code snippet draws a complex geometric shape using a recursive function.

to draw-shape :size :iterations
  if :iterations = 0 [stop] ; if no more iterations are left, stop the function
  rt 60 ; rotate right 60 degrees
  fd :size ; move forward by the size provided
  lt 30 ; rotate left 30 degrees
  fd :size / 2 ; move forward by half the size
  rt 90 ; rotate right 90 degrees
  fd :size / 4 ; move forward by a quarter of the size
  lt 60 ; rotate left 60 degrees
  fd :size / 2 ; move forward by half the size
  draw-shape :size / 2 :iterations - 1 ; recursively call the function with half the size and one less iteration
  rt 120 ; rotate right 120 degrees
  fd :size ; move forward by the size provided 
  draw-shape :size / 2 :iterations - 1 ; recursively call the function with half the size and one less iteration
end

; To start drawing the shape, call the function with the desired size and number of iterations
