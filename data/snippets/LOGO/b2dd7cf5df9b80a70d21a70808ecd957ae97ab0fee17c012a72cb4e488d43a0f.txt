; This code snippet rotates a turtle around a circle
; with varying colors and sizes based on user input

; Set the starting angle for the turtle
set heading 0

; Define the colors for the circle
setcolors [(255 0 0) (255 255 0) (0 255 0) (0 255 255) (0 0 255) (255 0 255)]

; Define the sizes for the circle
setsize 10

; Define the number of steps for the rotation
set step 30

; Define the number of repetitions for the entire rotation
set repetitions 12

; Define a variable to keep track of the current step
make "currentStep 1

; Define a repeat loop for the number of repetitions
repeat :repetitions [

  ; Define a repeat loop for the number of steps in each repetition
  repeat :step [

    ; Pick a random color from the defined colors
    setpencolor item random length :colors + 1 :colors

    ; Draw a line forward with the current size
    forward :size

    ; Turn the turtle by the current step amount
    right :currentStep

    ; Increase the current step by 1
    make "currentStep :currentStep + 1
  ]

  ; Decrease the size of the turtle by 1
  make "size :size - 1

  ; Reset the current step back to 1
  make "currentStep 1
