setxy -100 100
setheading 0

; Define a procedure to draw a forward line
to draw-line :length
  ; Check if length is not a positive value
  if :length <= 0 [stop]
  
  ; Draw a line of the given length
  fd :length
  
  ; Rotate the turtle by 10 degrees to the left
  left 10
  
  ; Call the procedure again with half the length
  draw-line :length / 2
end

; Define another procedure to draw the spiral
to draw-spiral :size
  ; Check if size is not a positive value
  if :size <= 0 [stop]
  
  ; Draw a line with the given size
  draw-line :size
  
  ; Call the procedure again with a smaller size
  draw-spiral :size - 10
end

; Call the draw-spiral procedure with an initial size of 100
