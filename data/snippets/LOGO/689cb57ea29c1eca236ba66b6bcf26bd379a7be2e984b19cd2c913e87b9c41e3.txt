; This code snippet uses the programming language LOGO to draw a spiral shape.

; Define a procedure called "spiral" with parameters "length" and "angle"
to spiral :length :angle

; Set the pen color to red
setpencolor "red 

; If the length is less than or equal to 1, stop the procedure
if :length <= 1 [stop]

; Move forward by the length value
forward :length 

; Turn right by the angle value
right :angle 

; Call the "spiral" procedure recursively with a length that is 10% smaller and an angle that is 5% larger
spiral (:length * 0.9) (:angle * 1.05)

; End the procedure
end

; Set the starting length and angle values
make "length 100
make "angle 15

; Call the "spiral" procedure
spiral :length :angle
