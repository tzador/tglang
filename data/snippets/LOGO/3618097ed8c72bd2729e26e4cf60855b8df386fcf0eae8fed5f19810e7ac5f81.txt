; This code snippet generates a spiral fractal

; set angle to 135 degrees
SETANGLE 135

; set initial length to 10
SETLENGTH 10

; define procedure for drawing spiral
TO DRAW
  ; keep drawing while length is less than or equal to 100
  IF LESSEQUAL [LENGTH] [100] [REPEAT FOREVER [
    ; draw a line with current length
    DRAW [LENGTH]

    ; increase length by 1
    SETLENGTH SUM [LENGTH] [1]

    ; rotate turtle by current angle
    ROTATE [ANGLE]
  ]]
END

; set turtle position to center of screen
SETXY HALFPAGE HALFPAGE

; loop through 100 iterations
REPEAT 100 [
  ; call DRAW procedure
