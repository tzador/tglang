; This code snippet will draw a spiral using the LOGO programming language

; Set initial values
make "angle 0
make "length 50
make "increment 10

; Set pen size and speed
setpensize 3
setspeed 0

; Define the spiral procedure
to spiral
  pu    ; Lift pen up
  rt :angle   ; Rotate right by angle value
  fd :length  ; Move forward by length value
  pd    ; Put pen down
  rt 90   ; Rotate right by 90 degrees
  make "length sum :length :increment   ; Increase the length by the increment value
  make "angle sum :angle 5   ; Increase the angle by 5 degrees
end

; Call the spiral procedure to draw the spiral
repeat 100 [spiral]
