; This code creates a spiral pattern using the turtle in LOGO
; Set initial variables for rotation angle and distance to move
make "angle 20
make "distance 10

; Define the procedure to draw one side of the spiral
to spiral
    forward :distance
    right :angle
end

; Define the procedure to create the entire spiral
to draw-spiral
    ; Use a loop to repeat the spiral procedure multiple times
    repeat 18 [
