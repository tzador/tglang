; This is a code snippet in the LOGO programming language
; It draws a spiral shape using recursive procedures

to spiral :size :angle
; define a procedure called spiral which takes two inputs: size and angle
  if :size > 10 [ ; check if the size of the shape is greater than 10
    fd :size ; move forward by the size value
    rt :angle ; turn right at the specified angle
    spiral :size / 1.1 :angle ; recursively call the spiral procedure
  ]
end

to draw-spiral :iterations :initial-size :initial-angle
; define a procedure that takes three inputs: the number of iterations, the initial size of the shape, and the initial angle to turn
  repeat :iterations [ ; repeat the following code for the specified number of iterations
    spiral :initial-size :initial-angle ; call the spiral procedure with the initial size and angle values
    set :initial-size :initial-size * 1.1 ; increase the initial size by 10%
    set :initial-angle :initial-angle / 1.1 ; decrease the initial angle by 10%
  ]
end

draw-spiral 10 100 90 ; call the draw-spiral procedure with 10 iterations, initial size of 100, and initial angle of 90 degrees
