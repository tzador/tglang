To fractal1 :length
  if :length < 10 [fd :length bk :length stop]

end
; This is a recursive procedure that draws a fractal pattern
; using the given length and repeated half the size of it.
; It uses the LT and RT commands to turn, and FD and BK to move forward and backward respectively.
; The STOP command is used to stop the procedure once the length is too small.

To fractal2 :length :angle
  if :length < 10 [fd :length bk :length stop]
  repeat 6 [repeat 3 [fd :length lt :angle * 2] bk :length rt :angle * 2]
  fractal2 :length / 1.4 :angle
end
; This is another recursive procedure that draws a different fractal pattern.
; It uses nested REPEAT commands to create a hexagonal shape, with each side having 3 smaller hexagons on it.
; The angle is reduced each time the procedure is called to create a spiral effect.
