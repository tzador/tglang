;; This code snippet draws a complex star pattern using the turtle in LOGO

;;; Variables for setting up the turtle
make "numSides 5 ;;; number of sides in the star
make "sideLength 100 ;;; length of each side
make "turnAngle (360 / :numSides) ;;; angle to turn to create each side

;;; Move the turtle to starting position
setx 0
sety 0

;;; Loop to create all the sides of the star
repeat :numSides [
  ;;; Draw each side
  fd :sideLength ;;; move forward by given length
  rt :turnAngle ;;; turn right by given angle
  
  ;;; Add more complexity by repeating the side drawing
  repeat :numSides [
    pu ;;; pen up to create gaps between sides
    fd :sideLength / 2 ;;; move half the length
    pd ;;; pen down to continue drawing
    fd :sideLength / 2 ;;; complete the side
    rt :turnAngle ;;; turn right for next side
  ]
    
  ;;; Move the turtle back to starting position
  pu ;;; pen up to prevent lines connecting to starting point
  bk :sideLength ;;; move back the length of one side
  rt :turnAngle ;;; turn right for next side
    
  ;;; Add more complexity by changing the turtle's color
  setpencolor random 256 ;;; set random pen color
]

;;; Finish the pattern by connecting the last side to the first
