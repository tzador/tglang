; This code snippet will draw a spiral pattern using the LOGO programming language
; The turtle will move forward and turn by a specific angle each time, creating the spiral effect

; Set the initial position of the turtle
setxy 0 0

; Define the variables for distance, angle and number of iterations
make "distance 5
make "angle 15
make "iterations 100

; Create a loop to repeat the movement of the turtle
repeat :iterations [
  fd :distance
  rt :angle
  make "distance :distance + 1 ; Increase the distance for each iteration
  make "angle :angle + 1 ; Increase the angle for each iteration
