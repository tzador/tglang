;; This code snippet creates a fractal using the 'repeat' and 'make' procedures
;; First, we define the 'makeLine' procedure which draws a line of a given length
;; The 'endProcedure' command informs the compiler that the procedure definition is complete

to makeLine :length
   fd :length
end 

;; Now we use the 'repeat' procedure to make multiple copies of the line at different angles
;; We also change the length of each line to create the fractal pattern
;; To avoid overlapping lines, we use the 'penup' and 'pendown' commands

to makeFractal :size :angle
   repeat 4 [
      makeLine :size
      rt :angle
      pu
      fd :size
      pd
      makeLine :size / 2
      rt :angle
      pu
      fd :size / 2
      pd
   ]
end

;; Finally, we use the 'makeFractal' procedure to create the actual fractal
;; We call it with the desired size and angle, and then clear the screen

makeFractal 100 90
clearscreen

;; You can experiment with different sizes and angles to create different variations of the fractal
