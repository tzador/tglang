;; create a procedure for drawing a star with given size and number of points
;; this procedure uses recursion to create multiple layers of triangles
;; assumptions: turtle is facing upward, pen is down
;; input: size (the length of each side of the triangle), points (the number of points in the star)

TO star :size :points
  IF :points = 0 [ STOP ] ;; base case, stop when all points are drawn
  RT 360 / :points ;; turn right by the appropriate angle for the current layer
  TRIANGLE :size ;; draw a triangle with the given size
  PU LT 180 FD :size LT 180 ;; move to the opposite side of the triangle
  PD
  star :size :points - 1 ;; recursively call the procedure with one less point
  PU RT 180 FD :size RT 180 ;; return to the original starting point on the triangle
  PD
  star :size :points - 1 ;; recursively call the procedure again for another layer
