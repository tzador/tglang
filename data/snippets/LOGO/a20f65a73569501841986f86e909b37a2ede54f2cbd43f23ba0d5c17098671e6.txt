; This Logo program draws a spiral shape

; Set the pen color to black
setpencolor black
; Set the pen down to start drawing
penup
pendown

; Define a recursive procedure to draw the spiral
to spiral :distance :angle
  ; Base case: stop when the distance is less than 1
  if :distance < 1 [stop]
  ; Move the turtle forward by the given distance
  forward :distance
  ; Rotate the turtle by the given angle
  right :angle
  ; Call the spiral procedure again, with a slightly smaller distance and a larger angle
  spiral :distance * 0.9 :angle + 5
end

; Set the initial distance and angle
setdistance 100
setangle 30

; Call the spiral procedure
spiral :distance :angle
