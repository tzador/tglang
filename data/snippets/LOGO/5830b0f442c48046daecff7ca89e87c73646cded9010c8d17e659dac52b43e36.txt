; This code snippet draws a spiral using recursive functions
; Initial values for the spiral
make "length 10

; Function for drawing a line
to draw

end

; Recursive function for drawing the spiral
to spiral :loops :length :angle
  if :loops = 0 [ ; Base case when the number of loops reaches 0
    output "Done
  ]
  else [ ; Recursive case
    draw ; Draw a line
    make "length :length * :factor ; Increase the line length
    spiral :loops-1 :length :angle ; Recursive call with updated values

end

; Call the spiral function to draw the spiral
