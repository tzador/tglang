; This code uses the turtle graphics feature of LOGO to create a complex spiral design
; Adjust the values of speed, angle and size to change the design

; Set up the drawing environment
TO START
    SETPC "BLACK ; Sets the pen color to black
    SETPOS [-200 0] ; Sets the initial position of the turtle
    SETHEADING 90 ; Sets the initial heading of the turtle to face upwards
    PENDOWN ; Places the pen on the drawing surface
END

; Create a recursive procedure to draw the spiral
TO SPIRAL :SIZE :ANGLE :SPEED
    IF :SIZE > 10 THEN ; Checks if the size is still greater than 10
        SETPENSIZE :SIZE ; Sets the size of the pen based on the current size parameter
        FORWARD :SIZE ; Moves the turtle forward by the size parameter
        RIGHT :ANGLE ; Turns the turtle to the right by the angle parameter
        SPIRAL (:SIZE - 1) :ANGLE :SPEED ; Recursively call the spiral procedure with a smaller size parameter
    END
END

; Main procedure to run the code
TO MAIN
    START ; Calls the start procedure to set up the drawing environment
    HIDETURTLE ; Hides the turtle from being displayed on the drawing surface
    SPEED :SPEED ; Sets the speed of the turtle to the value of the speed parameter
    REPEAT 360 [SPIRAL 100 1 10] ; Draws 360 iterations of the spiral, with a size of 100, angle of 1 degree, and speed of 10
END

MAIN ; Calls the main procedure to execute the code
