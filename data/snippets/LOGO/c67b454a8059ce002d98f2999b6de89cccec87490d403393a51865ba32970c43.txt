  clearscreen
  ; This creates a black background
  setpencolor black
  ; This sets the pen color to black
  setpensize 1
  ; This sets the pen's size to 1 pixel
  setpc 255 255 255
  ; This sets the pen's color to white

; This is a recursive function to create a fractal pattern
to fractal :size :angle :depth :color [
  ; This checks if the depth is greater than 0, if not it stops recursion
  if :depth <= 0 [
    stop
  ]
  ; This sets the pen's color based on the input
  setpencolor :color
  ; This draws a line of size length
  fd :size
  ; This turns the pen right by the input angle
  rt :angle
  ; This recursively calls the function 3 times with smaller size and different colors
  fractal :size / 3 :angle :depth - 1 :color + 15
  fractal :size / 3 :angle :depth - 1 :color - 20
  fractal :size / 3 :angle :depth - 1 :color + 30
  ; This turns the pen left by the input angle
  lt :angle
  ; This draws a line of size length
  fd :size
]

; This calls the fractal function with a size of 200, angle of 90, depth of 5, and initial color of 0
fractal 200 90 5 0
