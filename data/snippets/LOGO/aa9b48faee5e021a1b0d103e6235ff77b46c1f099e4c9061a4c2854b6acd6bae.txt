;;;;; SIMPLE SQUARE SPIRAL
; this code generates a square spiral design

; set turtle to starting position
home

; set initial angle
setheading 0

; loop to draw the spiral
repeat 20 [
  fd 20 ; move turtle forward 20 units
  rt 90 ; turn turtle right 90 degrees
  make "line length line + 20 ; calculate new length of spiral line
  ; make the spiral line longer for the next iteration

  ; loop to draw the square
  repeat 4 [
    fd :line ; move turtle forward the length of the spiral line
    rt 90 ; turn turtle right 90 degrees
  ]

  make "line length line + 10 ; increase the spiral line length for the next loop
  ; this creates a spiral that grows larger with each iteration
