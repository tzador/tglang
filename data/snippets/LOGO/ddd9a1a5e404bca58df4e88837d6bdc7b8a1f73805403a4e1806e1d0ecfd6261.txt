; This program draws a spiral using recursion

; Set the starting position and angle
setpos 0 0
setangle 0

; Define the recursive procedure to draw the spiral
to spiral :size
  ; Base case - stop when the size is less than 1 pixel
  if :size < 1 [stop]
  
  ; Draw a line with the current size
  forward :size
  
  ; Turn left by 90 degrees
  left 90
  
  ; Call the recursive procedure with a reduced size
  spiral :size - 1
  
  ; Turn right by 90 degrees
  right 90
  
  ; Call the recursive procedure with the same size
  spiral :size
end

; Call the recursive procedure to draw the spiral with a given size
spiral 100
