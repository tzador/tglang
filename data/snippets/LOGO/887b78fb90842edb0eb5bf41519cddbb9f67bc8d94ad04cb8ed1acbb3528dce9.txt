; Define a procedure for drawing a shape with the given side length and number of sides
; The procedure uses the `repeat` and `rt` commands to draw each side of the shape

; Sample usage:
; draw_shape 100 6 ; Draws a hexagon with side length 100 units
; draw_shape 50 3 ; Draws an equilateral triangle with side length 50 units

; We can also use variables to store the values
make "length 75
make "sides 8
draw_shape :length :sides ; Draws an octagon with side length 75 units
