;This code snippet uses the LOGO programming language to create a spiral

;Set the initial angle and length for each step
make "angle 90
make "length 5

;Define a procedure to draw each step of the spiral
to spiral-step
  forward :length
  right :angle
  make "length :length + 5
  make "angle :angle - 1
end

;Use a loop to repeat the spiral steps multiple times
repeat 100 [
  spiral-step
]

;Declare variables for the starting x and y positions
make "startX 0
make "startY 0

;Reset angle and length for a new spiral
make "angle 90
make "length 5

;Define a procedure to draw a spiral using the starting position and number of steps
to spiral
  penup
  setxy :startX :startY
  pendown
  repeat :steps [  ;use a repeat loop to draw the desired number of steps
    spiral-step
  ]
end

;Call the spiral procedure with desired starting position and number of steps
spiral 0 50 ;start at 0,0 and draw 50 steps

;Call the spiral procedure again with different starting position and number of steps
spiral 100 30 ;start at 100,0 and draw 30 steps
