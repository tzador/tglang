; This is a complex code snippet in LOGO programming language

; This code snippet creates a function that draws a spiral shape
; The function takes in two parameters: size and angle
; It starts by setting the pen size and color
; Then, it loops multiple times, each time increasing the size and changing the angle
; Finally, it ends by hiding the turtle and showing a message

to spiral :size :angle
  setpensize 3           ; set pen size to 3
  setpencolor "blue      ; set pen color to blue
  repeat 100 [           ; loop 100 times
    forward :size        ; move forward by the given size parameter
    right :angle         ; turn right by the given angle parameter
    setheading heading - 2         ; change the turtle's heading by -2 degrees
    setsize size + 0.1    ; increase the size by 0.1
  ]
  hideturtle             ; hide the turtle
  print "Spiral created! ; show a message
end
