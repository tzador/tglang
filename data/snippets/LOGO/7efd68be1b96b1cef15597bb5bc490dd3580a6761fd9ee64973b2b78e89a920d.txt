;This is a program that draws a snowflake pattern using recursion

;Define a procedure to draw a line
TO line :length :angle
  IF :length > 20 ;base case
    FORWARD :length
    RIGHT :angle
    line :length / 3 :angle ;recursive call with shorter length
    FORWARD :length
    LEFT :angle * 2
    line :length / 3 :angle ;recursive call with shorter length
    FORWARD :length
    RIGHT :angle
  END
END

;Set initial position and angle
SETXY 0 0
SETHEADING 0

;Set variables for length and angle
MAKE "length 100
MAKE "angle 120

;Call the line procedure to draw the first line
line :length :angle

;Define a procedure to draw six lines to form a snowflake
TO snowflake :length :angle
  line :length :angle
  REPEAT 5 [
    RIGHT :angle * 2
    line :length :angle
  ]
END

;Call the snowflake procedure to draw the rest of the snowflake
snowflake :length :angle

;Move turtle to a new position for next snowflake
SETXY 200 0

;Call the snowflake procedure again
snowflake :length :angle
