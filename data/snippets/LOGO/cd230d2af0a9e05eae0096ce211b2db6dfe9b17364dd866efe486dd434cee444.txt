;; This code prints out a spiral using the repeat function
;; Define variables for length, angle, and counter
make "length 10
make "angle 90
make "counter 0

;; Define the function 'spiral'
to spiral
   ;; Increase the length and angle each time the function is called
   make "length :length + 5
   make "angle :angle + 10
   ;; Use the repeat function to create a spiral with 36 lines
   repeat 36 [
      ;; Draw a forward line with the current length
      fd :length
      ;; Turn by the current angle
      rt :angle
      ;; Increase the counter by 1
      make "counter :counter + 1
      ;; Check if the counter has reached 36 (end of spiral)
      if :counter = 36 [
         ;; If it has, break out of the loop
         stop
      ]
   ]
;; Call the function to start the spiral
