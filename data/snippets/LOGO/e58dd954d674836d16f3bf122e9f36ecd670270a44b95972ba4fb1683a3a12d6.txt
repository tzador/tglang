; This code snippet draws a complex geometric design using turtle graphics.
; Define a procedure called "complex-design" that takes in a number as an argument
TO complex-design :size
  ; Set the turtle's pen size to the input number
  PENSIZE :size
  ; Set the turtle's speed to "fast" for faster drawing
  SPEED "fast
  ; Make the turtle draw a circle with a radius of half the input size
  CIRCLE :size / 2
  ; Repeat the following steps 5 times
  REPEAT 5 [
    ; Make the turtle draw a line with a length of input size
    FORWARD :size
    ; Turn the turtle 90 degrees to the right
    RIGHT 90
    ; Make the turtle draw a line with a length of half the input size
    FORWARD :size / 2
    ; Turn the turtle 45 degrees to the left
    LEFT 45
    ; Make the turtle draw a polygon with input size as the number of sides
    POLY :size :size
    ; Turn the turtle 45 degrees to the right
    RIGHT 45
    ; Make the turtle draw a line with a length of half the input size
    FORWARD :size / 2
    ; Turn the turtle 90 degrees to the left
    LEFT 90
    ; Make the turtle draw a line with a length of input size
    FORWARD :size
    ; Turn the turtle 36 degrees to the right
    RIGHT 36
    ; Make the turtle draw a star with 5 points and input size as the radius
    STAR 5 :size
    ; Turn the turtle 36 degrees to the left
    LEFT 36
    ; Make the turtle draw a line with a length of input size
    FORWARD :size
    ; Turn the turtle 72 degrees to the right
    RIGHT 72
    ; Make the turtle draw a square with input size as the length of each side
    SQUARE :size
