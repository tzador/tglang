; This code snippet generates a Koch curve using recursive procedures
; Input: length of the initial line, order (number of recursions)
; Output: a fractal Koch curve

generateKoch 100 4 ; calls the procedure to generate a Koch curve with length 100 and order 4
; Output: a Koch curve with length 100 and order 4 is generated on the screen using the LOGO turtle graphics library.
