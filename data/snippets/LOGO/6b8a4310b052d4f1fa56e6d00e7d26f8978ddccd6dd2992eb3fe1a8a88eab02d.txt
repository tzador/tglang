; The following code creates a functional maze with walls and an exit

; First, we need to set the canvas size and background color
setworldcoordinates(-10 -10 10 10)  ; set the world coordinates for the screen
setbg "black             ; set background color to black

; Next, we define the maze layout with walls and an exit
to maze
  ; Set the initial position and orientation of the turtle
  setxy -9.5 3
  sethd 0

  ; Draw the walls
  fd 1
  setpc "white
  lt 90
  fd 3
  rt 90
  fd 1

  ; Draw the vertical walls
  lt 90
  fd 3
  rt 90
  fd 2
  rt 90
  fd 3
  lt 90
  fd 2

  ; Draw the exit at the end of the maze
  setpc "red
  lt 90
  fd 2.5
  rt 90
  fd 1
  rt 90
  fd 1.5
  lt 90
  fd 1.5
  rt 90
  fd 1
end

; Finally, we call the maze function to generate the maze
