;; This code snippet is an example of a complex LOGO program that draws a spiral pattern.

;; First, we set the initial position and heading of the turtle.
;; Then, we define the size of the spiral and the number of iterations.
;; Lastly, we create a loop that executes the drawing commands for each iteration.

make "x 0  ;; x coordinate
make "y 0  ;; y coordinate
make "heading 0  ;; heading in degrees
make "size 10  ;; size of each segment
make "iterations 5  ;; number of iterations

;; Move the turtle to the starting position
setpos :x :y
setheading :heading

;; Loop for the specified number of iterations
repeat :iterations [
  ;; Draw a segment of the spiral and turn the turtle
  fd :size
  rt 90
  ;; Increase the size for the next segment
  make "size :size + 2
  ;; Change the heading by a set amount
  make "heading :heading + 10
