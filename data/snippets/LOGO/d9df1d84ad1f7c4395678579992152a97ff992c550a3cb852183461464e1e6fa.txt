;;This code snippet defines a procedure named "drawCircle" that takes in three parameters: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and radius of the circle.
;;First, the turtle's position is set to the point (x - r, y) which is the leftmost point of the circle.
;;Then, a loop is used to repeat 360 times, as there are 360 degrees in a circle.
;;Inside the loop, the turtle moves forward by the arc length of the circle at that particular degree, which is calculated by 2 * pi * r / 360. Then, the turtle turns right by 1 degree to trace out the circle.
;;Once the loop is completed, the turtle returns to its original position and the procedure ends.
