; This is a LOGO code snippet that draws a spiral shape
; using recursion and the 'forward' and 'right' commands
; The # symbol is used to increase the length of each segment
to spiral :size :angle 
  if :size > 1 [
    forward :size
    right :angle
    spiral :size - 1 #increases the size of the segment
      # by one each time the function is called
  ]
end
; Sets the initial value for size and angle
setsize 100
setangle 60
; Calls the spiral function with the given size and angle
spiral 100 60
