; This is a complex and long code snippet in LOGO
; It uses functions, variables, loops and conditional statements

make "length 10 ; create a variable called "length" with a value of 10
make "angle 60 ; create a variable called "angle" with a value of 10

to makeSquare ; define a function called "makeSquare"
  repeat 4 [ ; start a loop that will execute 4 times
    forward :length ; move forward according to the value of "length" variable
    left :angle ; turn left according to the value of "angle" variable
  ]
end ; end the function

to makeTriangle ; define a function called "makeTriangle"
  repeat 3 [ ; start a loop that will execute 3 times
    forward :length ; move forward according to the value of "length" variable
    left 120 ; turn left by a fixed angle of 120 degrees
  ]
end ; end the function

to makePolygon :numSides ; define a function called "makePolygon" that takes in a parameter called "numSides"
  make "angle 360 / :numSides ; calculate the angle needed to turn based on the number of sides
  repeat :numSides [ ; start a loop that will execute "numSides" times
    forward :length ; move forward according to the value of "length" variable
    left :angle ; turn left according to the value of "angle" variable
  ]
end ; end the function

makeSquare ; call the "makeSquare" function
makeTriangle ; call the "makeTriangle" function
makePolygon 7 ; call the "makePolygon" function with a parameter of 7 to make a heptagon
