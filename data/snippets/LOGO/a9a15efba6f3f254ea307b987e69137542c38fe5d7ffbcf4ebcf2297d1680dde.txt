; This code snippet generates a spiral shape in LOGO

; Define the length variable as 100
make "length 100

; Define the angle variable as 10
make "angle 10

; Set the starting position at coordinates (-50,0)
setpos [-50 0]

; Set the color to cyan
setpencolor "cyan

; Create a loop to draw the spiral
repeat 100 [
  ; Increase the length of the side
  make "length :length + 10
  ; Turn the turtle in the angle specified
  rt :angle
  ; Move the turtle forward by the length
