; Draws a spiral shape using the turtle graphics commands

; define a procedure to draw a spiral
to spiral
  ; set the initial angle to 0

  ; define variables to keep track of the current position and angle

  make "angle 0
  
  ; repeat the following steps 100 times
  repeat 100 [
    ; move the turtle forward by the current step length
    forward :step
    
    ; change the step length to create a spiral effect
    make "step :step * 0.95
    
    ; update the position and angle variables
    make "x position position
    make "y position position
