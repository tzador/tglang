; This code draws a spiral using the 'REPEAT' statement and a 'FORWARD' command
; It uses 'FOR' loops with nested 'REPEAT' statements to create a complex shape

; First, we set the starting position and angle of the turtle
; This will be the center of our spiral
; Remember, LOGO starts counting angles from the top, moving to the right
HOME
SETHEADING 90

; Next, we set variables for the length of each line and the number of lines we want
; These variables can be adjusted to create different spirals
; In this example, we will create a spiral with 200 lines
MAKE "LENGTH 100
MAKE "NUM_LINES 200

; Now we create a 'FOR' loop that will run as many times as the number of lines we want
; Each iteration of the loop, the turtle will draw a line and turn a certain angle
FOR ["I 1 :NUM_LINES 1] [
  FORWARD :LENGTH
  RIGHT (:I * 2)
  
  ; Inside the 'FOR' loop, we create a 'REPEAT' statement
  ; This will draw multiple lines with a decreasing length, creating a spiral effect
  REPEAT [:I 1 (:NUM_LINES - :I)] [
    FORWARD :LENGTH
    BACK :I
