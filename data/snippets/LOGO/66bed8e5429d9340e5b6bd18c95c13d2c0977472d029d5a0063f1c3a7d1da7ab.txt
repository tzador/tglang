; This code snippet draws a star with random colors and sizes

to star :size :color
  ; set the pen color to the given color
  setpencolor :color
  ; draw a line with a random length
  fd :size
  ; turn right 144 degrees (to make an angle)
  rt 144
  ; if the size is greater than 2, repeat this process
  if :size > 2 [star :size / 2 (random 140) + 20]
end

; set the shape to a turtle
shape "turtle"
; hide the turtle so it doesn't show up in the drawing
hideturtle

; loop to draw 100 stars
repeat 100 [
  ; set the size to a random number between 1 and 50
  let size (random 50) + 1
  ; set the color to a random number between 1 and 10
  let color (random 10) + 1
  ; call the star function with the random size and color
  star :size :color
