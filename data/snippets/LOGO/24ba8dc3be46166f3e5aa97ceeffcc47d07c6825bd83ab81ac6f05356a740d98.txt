; This code snippet creates procedures for drawing a circle and spiral in LOGO programming language.
; The 'to' keyword indicates the start of a procedure definition.
; 'circle' and 'spiral' are the names of the procedures.
; :radius, :start, :end, and :angle are the input parameters for the procedures.
; The [fd :radius rt 1] command inside the circle procedure moves the turtle forward by :radius units and then turns it right by 1 degree.
; The [repeat 360 [fd :radius rt 1]] command repeats this movement 360 times, effectively drawing a circle.
; In the spiral procedure, the [stop] command is used to end the recursion when :start becomes greater than :end.
; The [rt :angle] command turns the turtle right by :angle degrees.
; The [forward :start] command moves the turtle forward by :start units.
; The [spiral :start + 1 :end :angle] command recursively calls the spiral procedure, gradually increasing the distance traveled and turning angle until the base case is reached.
