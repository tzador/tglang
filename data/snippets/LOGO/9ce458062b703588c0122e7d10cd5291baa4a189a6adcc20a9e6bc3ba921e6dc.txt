; This code snippet draws a flower using recursive procedures

; Define the main procedure to draw a petal
to petal :size :angle
  ; Set the size of the petal
  setsize :size
  ; Set the color of the petal to pink
  setcolor [255 102 178]
  ; Move forward by the size of the petal
  forward :size
  ; Turn left by the given angle
  left :angle
  ; Move forward by half the size of the petal
  forward :size/2
  ; Turn right by double the given angle
  right :angle*2
  ; Move forward by half the size of the petal
  forward :size/2
  ; Turn left by the given angle
  left :angle
  ; Move forward by the size of the petal
  forward :size
end

; Define a recursive procedure to draw a complete flower
to flower :size :angle :count
  ; Base case: draw a petal and stop drawing
  if :count = 0 [ petal :size :angle ]
  ; Recursive case: draw a petal, turn left, and call the same procedure again with a smaller size and count
  petal :size :angle
  left 36
  flower :size*0.9 :angle :count-1
end

; Call the flower procedure with a size of 100 and 10 petals
