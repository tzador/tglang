to spiral
    ; This function uses recursion to create a spiral pattern using forward turtle movement and left/right turning
    repeat 4
        fd 5 * repcount ; move the turtle forward by a multiple of the current repeat count (increasing by 5 each time)
        lt 90 * repcount ; turn the turtle left by a multiple of the current repeat count (increasing by 90 each time)
    end
    
    to draw-spiral
        ; This function draws multiple spirals of different sizes using the spiral function defined above
        repeat 10
            spiral ; call the spiral function to create a spiral
            pu ; lift the turtle's pen up
            fd 10 ; move the turtle forward without drawing a line
            pd ; put the turtle's pen down
            rt 36 ; turn the turtle right by 36 degrees (to create a spiral effect)
        end
end

draw-spiral ; call the draw-spiral function to see the resulting pattern
