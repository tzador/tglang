;This code is a function that draws a spiral using the repeat and forward commands
;The inputs are the number of iterations for the spiral and the initial length
;The spiral is drawn in a clockwise direction

TO spiral :iterations :length
  REPEAT :iterations
    FORWARD :length
    RIGHT 90
    SETLEN :length * 0.9 ;reduces the length by 10% every iteration
  END
END

;Example usage:
;spiral 5 100 ;draws a spiral with 5 iterations and initial length of 100
