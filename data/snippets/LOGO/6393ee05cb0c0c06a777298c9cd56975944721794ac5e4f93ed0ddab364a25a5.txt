; This program draws a fractal tree using recursion
; Define the recursive function to draw a branch
TO branch :size
    ; Set the base case of recursion
    IF :size < 5 [STOP]

    ; Draw a line to represent the branch
    FD :size

    ; Turn left and call the function recursively to draw two smaller branches
    LT 30
    branch :size / 2
    RT 60
    branch :size / 2

    ; Turn right and call the function recursively to draw two smaller branches
    RT 30
    branch :size / 2
    LT 60
    branch :size / 2

    ; Return to the starting point
    LT 30
    BK :size

; Set initial size of the tree and call the function to draw it
