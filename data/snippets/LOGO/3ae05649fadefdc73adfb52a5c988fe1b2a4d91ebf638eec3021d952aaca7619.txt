;This code snippet draws a spiral design using recursive functions

TO spiral :length :angle
    ;set base case
    IF :length < 20 [STOP]

    ;draw a line of the given length
    FD :length

    ;rotate the turtle by the given angle
    RIGHT :angle

    ;recursive call, with decreased length and increased angle
    spiral :length - 3 :angle + 1

    ;rotate the turtle back to original angle
    LEFT :angle

    ;recursive call, with decreased length and increased angle
    spiral :length - 3 :angle + 1

END

;set initial length and angle values
MAKE "length 100
MAKE "angle 15

;call the recursive function to draw the spiral
spiral :length :angle
