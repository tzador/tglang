to add :x :y ; Defines a procedure called "add" with two inputs, :x and :y
  output :x + :y ; The procedure outputs the sum of :x and :y
end

make "result add :a :b ; Calls the "add" procedure, passing in the values of "a" and "b" as inputs, and assigns the output to the variable "result"

if :result > :a ; Checks if the value of "result" is greater than the value of "a"
  print "Result is greater than a" ; If true, prints "Result is greater than a"
  make "c :result ; Assigns the value of "result" to the variable "c"
  print :c ; Prints the value of "c"
end

ifelse :result < :b ; Checks if the value of "result" is less than the value of "b"
  [print "Result is less than b] ; If true, prints "Result is less than b"
  [print "Result is equal to b"] ; If false, prints "Result is equal to b"

repeat 4 [ ; Loops 4 times
  fd :c ; Moves forward by the value of "c"
