; This is a complex LOGO code that will draw a colorful spiral that changes colors and sizes

CLEARSCREEN ; clears the screen
SETX 0 ; sets the initial x coordinate to 0
SETY 0 ; sets the initial y coordinate to 0
PENUP ; lifts the pen up
SETHEADING 0 ; sets the initial direction of the turtle to 0 degrees
PENCOLOR 1 ; sets the initial color of the pen to 1 (red)

REPEAT 360 [ ; repeats the following instructions 360 times
    FORWARD 10 ; moves the turtle forward by 10 units
    PENCOLOR RANDOM 15 ; changes the color of the pen to a random color between 1 and 15
    PENWIDTH RANDOM 10 ; changes the width of the pen to a random value between 1 and 10
    RIGHT 5 ; turns the turtle to the right by 5 degrees
    IF XCOR > 300 [ ; checks if the x coordinate is greater than 300
        SETX -300 ; if true, sets the x coordinate to -300 (looping back to the other side of the screen)
    ]
    IF YCOR > 300 [ ; checks if the y coordinate is greater than 300
        SETY -300 ; if true, sets the y coordinate to -300 (looping back to the other side of the screen)
