; This is a LOGO code snippet.
; It will create a spiral shape using the FORWARD and RIGHT commands.
; The size of the spiral can be changed by adjusting the values of the variables.

TO SPIRAL
  REPEAT 30 [; repeat the following commands 30 times
    FORWARD :DIST; move forward a distance determined by the variable DIST
    RIGHT :ANGLE; turn right at an angle determined by the variable ANGLE
    IFELSE :ANGLE > 5 [; if the angle is greater than 5, decrease it by 0.1
      SETANGLE :ANGLE - 0.1
    ] [
      ; else, increase the angle by 0.5
      SETANGLE :ANGLE + 0.5
    ]
    SETDIST :DIST + 1; increase the distance by 1
  ]
END

; set the initial values of the variables
SETANGLE 90
SETDIST 5

; call the SPIRAL procedure to create the spiral
