; This code snippet draws a flower using recursive functions in LOGO

; Define a procedure to draw a petal
; Takes in the current angle and the length of the petal
to petal :angle :length
  repeat 2 [
    fd :length
    rt :angle
    fd :length
    resetangle
  ]
end

; Define a procedure to draw the stem of the flower
; Takes in the length of the stem and the angle of its bend
to stem :length :angle
  fd :length
  rt :angle
  fd :length
end

; Define a procedure to draw the entire flower
; Takes in the number of petals, length and angle of the stem
to flower :petals :length :angle
  repeat :petals [
    petal :angle :length
    rt (360 / :petals)
  ]
  stem :length :angle
end

; Call the procedure to draw the flower
