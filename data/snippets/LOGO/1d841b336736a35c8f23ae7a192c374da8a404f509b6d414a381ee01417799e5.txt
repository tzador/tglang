; This code snippet generates a complex, animated spiral shape using the LOGO programming language.

; Define the starting position and color of the pen
SETXY 0 0
SETPC 0
; Set the initial angle and length of the lines that make up the spiral
MAKE "angle 10
MAKE "length 10

; Define a procedure to draw a line moving outward and rotating
TO DRAWLINE :angle :length
FD :length
RT :angle
END

; Define the main procedure to create the spiral
TO SPIRAL
REPEAT 50 [
  MAKE "length (:length + 10) ; increase the length of the lines for each iteration
  DRAWLINE :angle :length ; draw the line
  RT :angle ; rotate for the next iteration
]
END

; Call the main procedure to create the spiral
SPIRAL

; Define a procedure to repeatedly rotate the spiral and change pen color
TO ANIMATE
CLL SPIRAL ; clear the screen and redraw the spiral
SETPC RAND 16 ; choose a random pen color from 0-15
MAKE "angle (:angle + 10) ; increase the rotation angle for the next iteration
END

; Create an infinite loop to continuously animate the spiral
WHILE [1 = 1] [
  ANIMATE ; call the animation procedure
  WAIT 0.1 ; pause for 0.1 seconds before looping again
]
