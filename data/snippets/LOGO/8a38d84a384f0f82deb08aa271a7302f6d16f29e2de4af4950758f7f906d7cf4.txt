; Code Explanation:
; The first line repeats the following commands 18 times
; The FORW command moves the turtle forward by 100 units
; The RT command turns the turtle right by 160 degrees
; The second FORW command moves the turtle forward again by 100 units
; The second RT command turns the turtle right by 180 degrees, bringing it back to its original position
; The inner REPEAT loop is used to draw the petals of the flower
; The FORW command moves the turtle forward by 30 units
; The RT command turns the turtle right by 70 degrees, creating a diagonal line for the petal
; The third FORW command creates the other half of the petal
; The LT command turns the turtle left by 30 degrees, bringing the turtle back to its original orientation
; Once the petals are drawn, the turtle lifts its pen (PU) and moves forward by 100 units to start drawing the next petal
; The LT command turns the turtle left by 120 degrees before lowering its pen again (PD) to continue drawing the flower
