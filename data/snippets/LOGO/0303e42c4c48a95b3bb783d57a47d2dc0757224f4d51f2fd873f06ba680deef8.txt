; This code snippet draws a spiral using the LOGO programming language

; Define the starting point of the spiral
setxy 0 0

; Define the initial angle of the turtle
seth 0

; Define the initial length of each spiral side
setl 1

; Define the variable that controls the number of spirals
make "spiral_count 10

; Define the variable that controls the angle by which the turtle turns
make "angle 15

; Define the variable that controls the length of each spiral side
make "length 2

; Define the procedure that draws a single spiral
to spiral
  ; Repeat the following steps for the desired number of spirals
  repeat :spiral_count [
    ; Move forward by the current length
    fd :length
      
    ; Turn the turtle by the defined angle
    rt :angle
      
    ; Increase the current length by 1
    set :length :length + 1
  ]
end

; Define the procedure that draws a full spiral
to full_spiral
  ; Repeat the following steps for 360 degrees
  repeat 360 [
    ; Call the spiral procedure
    spiral
    ; Turn the turtle by 1 degree
    rt 1
  ]
end

; Call the full_spiral procedure to draw the spiral
full_spiral

; Output: A spiral made up of 10 individual spirals, with each spiral having a length that increases by 1 with each turn.
