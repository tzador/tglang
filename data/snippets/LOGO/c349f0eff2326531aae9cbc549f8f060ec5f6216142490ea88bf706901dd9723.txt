;;; This is a complex code snippet in LOGO programming language
;;; It creates a recursive procedure to draw a spiral with variable length
;;; and angle of rotation

;;; Declare global variables
GLOBAL [length 50 ; length of each side
        angle 30] ; angle of rotation

;;; Recursive procedure to draw spiral
TO drawSpiral :size :rotation
    IF :size < 5 [STOP]
    REPEAT 4 [
        FORWARD :size
        LEFT :rotation
        drawSpiral :size - 5 :rotation
    ]
END

;;; Call the procedure
drawSpiral length angle
