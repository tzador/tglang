;This code uses a nested loop to create a colorful spiral pattern

;Define the main procedure with the number of rotations and length of each line as inputs
to spiral :rotations :length
  ;Set variables for the starting position and angle
  setxy 0 0
  setheading 0
  
  ;Set the initial color
  setpencolor 1
  
  ;Use a for loop to create the spiral
  repeat :rotations [
    ;Use another for loop to draw each line of the spiral
    repeat :rotations [
      ;Set the line width to 1
      setpensize 1
      
      ;Start drawing the line
      pd
      
      ;Use a nested loop to set the pen color for each line
      ;The color changes based on the current iteration of the outer for loop
      repeat :rotations [
        setpencolor :i
        ;Draw the line with the specified length
        forward :length
      ]
      
      ;Raise the pen to prevent drawing connecting lines
      pu
      
      ;Rotate the turtle by an angle based on the current iteration of the inner for loop
      rt (:rotations * (45 / :i))

    ;Change the starting position for the next rotation
    setxy :rotations :rotations
    ;Change the angle for the next rotation
    setheading :rotations
