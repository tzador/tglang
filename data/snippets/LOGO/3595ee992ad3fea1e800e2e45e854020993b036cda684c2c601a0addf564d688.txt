; This is a code snippet in LOGO, a programming language used to create graphics and interact with turtle objects.

; First, we define a procedure called "spiral" that takes in a parameter "length".
make "spiral procedure [:length [
    ; Set the step size of the turtle to the length divided by 20.
    ; This will be used to determine how far the turtle moves in each step.
    setstep :length / 20
    ; Set the angle of the turtle to 90 degrees.
    ; This will be used to create a spiral shape.
    setheading 90
    ; Start a for loop that iterates from 0 to the length parameter.
    ; This will determine the number of steps the turtle takes.
    for [i 0 :length] [
        ; Move the turtle forward by i steps.
        forward :i
        ; Turn the turtle to the right by 10 degrees.
        right 10
    ]
]]

; Call the "spiral" procedure and pass in a value of 200 for the length parameter.
spiral 200
