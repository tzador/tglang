to draw-spiral :size :angle  # Defines a procedure called "draw-spiral" that takes in two input parameters, namely "size" and "angle".
  if :size < 5 [stop]  # Checks if the size parameter is less than 5. If true, ends the procedure.
  fd :size rt :angle  # Moves the turtle forward by the size value and then turns right by the angle value.
  draw-spiral :size*0.95 :angle+5  # Calls the draw-spiral procedure recursively, with the size value reduced by 5% and the angle value increased by 5.
end  # Ends the procedure definition.

to start
  clearscreen  # Clears the screen.
  setxy 0 0  # Moves the turtle to the center of the screen.
  draw-spiral 100 15  # Calls the draw-spiral procedure with the initial size value of 100 and an angle value of 15.
end  # Ends the procedure definition.

start  # Calls the start procedure, which in turn calls the draw-spiral procedure to create a spiral.
