; This code uses the LOGO programming language to draw a complex geometric shape using recursion and iterative procedures

; Define a recursive procedure to draw a square with a specified size
TO square :size
  IF :size < 1 [STOP]
  REPEAT 4 [FORWARD :size
            RIGHT 90]
  square :size - 15 ; recursive call with slightly smaller size
END

; Define an iterative procedure to draw a series of squares with decreasing sizes and alternating colors
TO square_spiral :size :color
  REPEAT :size [setpc :color
                FORWARD 60
                square :size
                setpc [255 - :color] ; alternate color
                RIGHT 60]
END

; Set initial conditions and execute the drawing procedures
SETPC 0 ; set pen color to black
PENUP ; lift pen to prevent drawing during setting stage
FORWARD 100 ; move turtle to starting position
LEFT 90 ; turn turtle to face upward
Pendown ; put pen down to start drawing
square_spiral 9 200 ; start with largest size and blue color
DONE ; end program execution
