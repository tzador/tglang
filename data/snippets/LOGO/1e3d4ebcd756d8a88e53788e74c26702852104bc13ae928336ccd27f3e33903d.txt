; This is a program to draw nested squares in LOGO language
; with each square being a different color and size.

; Define procedure to draw a single square with a given size and color
to square :size :color
  setpensize :size
  setpc :color
  repeat 4 [ fd :size rt 90 ]
end

; Define procedure to draw nested squares recursively
to nested-squares :size :colors
  if length :colors = 1 [ stop ]
  square :size first :colors
  let new-colors bf :colors
  nested-squares :size * 0.9 :new-colors
end

; Set background color to white and pen color to black
setbg "white
setpc "black

; Define list of colors to use for squares
make "colors [ "green "blue "yellow "red "orange ]

; Call the nested-squares procedure with initial size of 100 and list of colors
nested-squares 100 :colors
