; This code snippet creates a stack of triangles, starting with a larger triangle at the bottom and decreasing in size as the stack goes up. It uses a recursive function to draw smaller triangles within each larger one.
; The macro "triangle" simplifies the code by repeating the same instructions for creating a triangle three times in a row.
; The "shape" procedure sets the starting position and draws the first two triangles using the "triangle" macro, and then calls the recursive function "graphic-procedure" to draw the smaller triangles within each larger one.
