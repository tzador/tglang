; This code snippet draws a complex and intricate pattern using LOGO turtle commands
; Initialize variables
make "x 3
make "y 60
make "z 10

; Creating a loop to draw a series of polygons
repeat 36 [
  ; Set the rotation angle based on value of x
  setheading :x
  pd ; Pen down to start drawing
  repeat 9 [
    ; Draw a polygon with a variable number of sides based on value of z
    repeat :z [fd :y rt 360/:z]
    rt 10 ; Rotate turtle for next iteration
  ]
  pu ; Pen up to stop drawing
  lt 90 ; Rotate turtle to next position
  fd 10 ; Move turtle forward
  rt 10 ; Rotate turtle
