; This code snippet draws a spiral using the turtle graphics in LOGO
; `make "side 5` defines a variable "side" with a value of 5
; `make "angle 20` defines a variable "angle" with a value of 20
; `make "numSpirals 10` defines a variable "numSpirals" with a value of 10

; Sets the initial position of the turtle at the center of the screen and points it upwards

; Defines a recursive procedure called "spiral" that draws one spiral
to spiral
  forward :side         ; Moves the turtle forward by the value of "side"
  right :angle          ; Rotates the turtle right by the value of "angle"
  make "side :side + 5  ; Increases the value of "side" by 5 to make the spiral larger
  make "angle :angle - 1 ; Decreases the value of "angle" by 1 to make the spiral more curved
  if :side < 200 [spiral] ; If the value of "side" is less than 200, the procedure "spiral" is called again
end

; Uses a for loop to draw multiple spirals by calling the procedure "spiral"
; Each spiral is drawn with a different color and starting position
