;This code snippet draws a spiral pattern using recursion in LOGO
to spiral [s l a]
    setheading (+ heading l) ;sets the turtle's heading based on the length value
    forward s ;moves the turtle forward based on the size value
    if s > 5 [ ;recursive function until size is less than 5
        spiral s+5 l-1 a ; call the spiral function with increasing size and decreasing level
    ]
    if l < a [ ; stop recursion once level is less than angle
        spiral s l+1 a ; call the spiral function with same size and increasing level
    ]
end

; set initial values
setheading 0 ; set initial heading
forward 10 ; move turtle forward
pendown ; put pen down to start drawing
speed 0 ; set turtle speed to maximum for faster drawing
spiral 10 3 30 ; call the spiral function with initial size, level, and angle

;expected output: a spiral pattern drawn by the turtle
