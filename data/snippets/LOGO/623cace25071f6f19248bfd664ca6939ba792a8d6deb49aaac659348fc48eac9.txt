;This code snippet draws a fractal tree with recursion

;Set initial parameters
make "angle 37
make "depth 9
make "length 150

;Define a procedure to draw a branch of the tree
to drawBranch
  ;Check if recursion depth has been reached
  if :depth = 0[stop]
  ;Move forward and draw a line
  forward :length [pendown fd :length]
  ;Rotate right and decrease length for next branch
  right :angle
  make "length ( :length * 0.8 )
  ;Recursively call this procedure to draw smaller branches
  (apply "drawBranch [ level :depth - 1] (list :depth))
  ;Rotate left and restore length for next branch
  left :angle
  make "length ( :length / 0.8 )
  ;Move backward to original position
  back :length
end

;Call the procedure to start drawing the tree
drawBranch
