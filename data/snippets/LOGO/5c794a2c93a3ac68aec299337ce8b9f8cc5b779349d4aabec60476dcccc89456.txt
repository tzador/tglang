; This code snippet generates a fractal using the LOGO programming language
; It uses recursive procedures to generate multiple copies of itself at decreasing sizes

; Set the number of iterations for the fractal
to setup
  setiterations 10
  clearscreen
end

; Define the main procedure to generate the fractal
to fractal
  make "size 300 ; Set the initial size of the fractal
  make "angle 60 ; Set the angle for each branch

  ; Start the recursive procedure to generate the fractal
  repeat "iterations [
    fractal-penup ; Move the pen up
    forward :size ; Move forward by the current size
    fractal-pendown ; Move the pen down
    fractal-branch ; Call the procedure to generate the branches
    right :angle ; Rotate right by the angle for the next branch
  ]
end

; Define the procedure to generate the branches recursively
to fractal-branch
  if :size < 5 [stop] ; Stop generating branches if the size gets too small

  make "size :size * 0.8 ; Reduce the size for each successive branch
  make "angle :angle * 0.9 ; Adjust the angle for more natural-looking branches

  ; Generate two branches for each iteration
  repeat 2 [
    fractal-pendown ; Move the pen down
    forward :size ; Move forward by the current size
    right :angle ; Rotate right by the angle for the next branch
    fractal-branch ; Call the procedure again for the next branch
    left :angle ; Rotate left by the same angle for the second branch
    fractal-branch ; Call the procedure again for the second branch
  ]
end

; Initialize the fractal by calling the setup procedure

; Generate the fractal
