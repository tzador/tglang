to spiral :size

    forward :size

    spiral :size - 1
  ]
end
; Explanation:
; This code uses the LOGO programming language to draw a spiral using recursion.
; The "to" command declares a new procedure called "spiral" with a parameter of "size".
; The if statement checks if the size is greater than 0.
; If it is, the turtle will move forward by the size and turn right by 15 degrees.
; Then, the spiral procedure is called again with a size that is 1 smaller.
; This continues until the size reaches 0 and the spiral ends.
; To run this code, type "spiral <desired size>" in the LOGO interpreter.
