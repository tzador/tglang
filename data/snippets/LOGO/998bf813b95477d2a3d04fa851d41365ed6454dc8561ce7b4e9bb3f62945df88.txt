;; This program uses the "TIME" command to create a stopwatch that counts down from 10 to 0, displaying
;; a message when the time is up.

;; Define a procedure that counts down from a specified number
TO COUNTDOWN :NUMBER
  ;; If the number is greater than 0, print the number and then recursively call the procedure with one less
  ;; than the current number
  IF :NUMBER > 0 [PRINT :NUMBER COUNTDOWN :NUMBER - 1]

;; Define a procedure that starts and stops the stopwatch
TO TIME
  ;; Set the starting number to 10 (in seconds)
  MAKE :NUMBER 10
  
  ;; Repeat 10 times, counting down by 1 second each time
  REPEAT 10 [COUNTDOWN :NUMBER MAKE :NUMBER :NUMBER - 1]
  
  ;; Display a message when the time is up
  PRINT "Time's Up!"

;; Run the procedure to start the stopwatch
TIME
