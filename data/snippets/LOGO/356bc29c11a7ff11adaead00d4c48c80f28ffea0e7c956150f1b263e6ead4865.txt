; this command creates a variable named "lineLength" and sets it to 100

to square
  repeat 4 [
    fd :lineLength
    rt 90
  ]
  ; this "square" procedure will draw a square with the length of the "lineLength" variable and a right turn of 90 degrees between each side.
  
  ; test call

to triangle
  repeat 3 [
    fd :lineLength
    rt 120

  ; calling the procedure will draw a triangle on the canvas. 
  
to polygon :sides
  make "angle 360 / :sides
  repeat :sides [
    fd :lineLength
    rt :angle
  ]
  ; this "polygon" procedure takes in a parameter "sides" and uses it to determine the angle for each side, while drawing a polygon with the length of the "lineLength" variable.
  
  ; test call
  polygon 6
  ; calling the procedure with 6 as the parameter will draw a hexagon on the canvas.
