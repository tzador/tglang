;;This code snippet generates a fractal pattern using recursion
;;Define procedure to draw a line of a given length
to line :length
   forward :length
end

;;Define procedure to draw a right angle turn
to right
   right 90
end

;;Define procedure to draw a Koch curve of a given order and length
to koch :order :length
   ;;Base case, if order is 0, simply draw a line
   if :order = 0 [
      line :length
   ]
   ;;Recursive case
   else [
      ;;Draw one third of the length
      koch :order - 1 :length / 3

      left 60
      ;;Draw one third of the length
      koch :order - 1 :length / 3

;;Set initial conditions to draw the fractal pattern
;;Move the cursor to the bottom left corner
setpos -150 -100
;;Set the order of the fractal, higher order results in more complex pattern
set order 4
;;Set the length of the first line
set length 200
;;Call the koch procedure to draw the fractal
koch :order :length
