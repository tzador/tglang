; This program draws a Sierpinski triangle
; Set the starting values for x and y coordinates
make "x -200
make "y -150
; Set the length of the sides of the triangle
make "length 300
; Set the list of possible angles to be used for turning
make "angles [60 -120 0]
; Define a recursive function to draw a triangle and repeat three times
to drawTriangle
  ; Base case - stop function when length is less than 10
  if :length <= 10 [stop]
  ; Draw a triangle with current x and y coordinates
  repeat 3 [
    fd :length
    rt item 1 :angles
    fd :length
    rt item 2 :angles
    fd :length
    rt item 3 :angles
  ]
  ; Call function again with new x and y coordinates and length divided by 2
  fd :length
  rt item 1 :angles
  fd :length
  lt item 2 :angles
  drawTriangle
  fd :length
  lt item 3 :angles
  drawTriangle
  ; Return to starting point

end

; Call the function to draw the triangle
