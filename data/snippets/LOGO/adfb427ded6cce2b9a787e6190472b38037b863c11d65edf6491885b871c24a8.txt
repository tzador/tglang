; This code uses the LOGO programming language to draw a complex pattern with multiple layers and colors

; Set the turtle's starting position and angle
setxy 0 0
setheading 0

; Define variables for the number of layers and the number of sides in each layer
make "num-layers 6
make "num-sides 5

; Define the colors to be used in each layer
make "colors [4 9 6 3 7 2]

; Define the function to draw a single layer
to layer :num-sides
  ; Use a for loop to draw each side of the layer
  repeat :num-sides [
    ; Set the turtle's color to the color of the current layer
    setpc item :num-sides :colors
    ; Draw a side of the layer
    fd 50
    ; Turn the turtle by 360 divided by the number of sides in the layer
    rt 360 / :num-sides

end

; Use a for loop to draw each layer
repeat :num-layers [
  ; Call the layer function with the current number of sides
  layer :num-sides
  ; Change the number of sides for the next layer
  make "num-sides :num-sides + 1
  ; Move the turtle back to the starting position and turn it by 30 degrees
