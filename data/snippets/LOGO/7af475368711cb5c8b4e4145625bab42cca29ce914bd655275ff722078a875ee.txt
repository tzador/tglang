; This is a complex code snippet in LOGO, a programming language commonly used for creating graphics and animations.
; It demonstrates the use of multiple commands and data structures in LOGO.

to generate-spiral
  ; This procedure generates a spiral made up of multiple circles of increasing size.
  let radius 10       ; initial radius of first circle
  let angle 0         ; initial angle of first circle
  let steps 50        ; number of circles to draw
  
  repeat steps [      ; loop to draw each circle
    penup             ; lift pen so no line is drawn
    forward radius    ; move forward the radius distance
    right angle       ; turn right by the angle
    pendown           ; put pen down to start drawing
    repeat 360 [      ; loop to draw a circle
      forward 2       ; move forward a small distance
      right 1         ; turn right slightly
    ]
    setradius radius  ; set the radius of the next circle
    setangle angle    ; set the angle for the next circle
    
    ; The following code adjusts the radius and angle for the next circle.
    ; It is based on the golden angle, which is approximately 137.5 degrees.
    set radius (radius + radius / 2)    ; increase the radius by half its current value
    set angle (angle + 137.5)           ; increase the angle by the golden angle
  ]
end

; Call the generate-spiral procedure to draw the spiral.
