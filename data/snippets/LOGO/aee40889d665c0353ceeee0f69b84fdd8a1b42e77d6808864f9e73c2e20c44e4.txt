TO SPIRAL :SIDE :ANGLE
;This code generates a spiral with a given side length and angle

IF :SIDE > 20 [STOP]
;If the side length is greater than 20, stop the program

REPEAT 360 / :ANGLE [
  FD :SIDE
  RT :ANGLE
  ;Repeats the following code 360 divided by the given angle
  ;Ensures a perfectly symmetrical spiral

  IF :SIDE < 1 [STOP]
  ;If the side length becomes less than 1, stop the program

  SPIRAL :SIDE - 1 :ANGLE * 0.7
  ;Recursively calls the SPIRAL procedure with a shortened side length
  ;and a slightly smaller angle to create a tighter spiral
