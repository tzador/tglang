; This is a LOGO program that draws a spiral shape using recursion 

make "length 50
make "angle 90
make "count 1

to spiral
  if :length > 0 [ ; checks if the length is greater than 0
    fd :length
    rt :angle
    make "count :count + 1 ; increments the count by 1 
    if :count < 20 [ ; checks if the count is less than 20
      make "length :length * 0.9 ; decreases the length by 10% 
      make "angle :angle - rand 10 ; randomly decreases the angle between 0-10 degrees
      spiral ; calls the spiral function again
    ]
  ]
end

spiral ; calls the spiral function to start drawing the spiral
