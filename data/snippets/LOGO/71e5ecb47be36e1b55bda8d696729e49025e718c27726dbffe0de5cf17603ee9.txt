; Draws a complex spiral shape
RPINUM = 30 ; Set the number of iterations for the spiral
DIST = 10 ; Set the distance between each point in the spiral
ANGLE = 20 ; Set the angle between each point in the spiral

REPEAT RPINUM [ ; Repeat the following code for the number of iterations
  PENUP ; Lift the pen up to prevent drawing
  RIGHT ANGLE ; Turn right by the set angle
  FORWARD DIST ; Move the turtle forward by the set distance
  PENDOWN ; Put the pen down to start drawing again
  FOR [NUM 1 RPINUM 1] [ ; Repeat the following code for the number of iterations that it takes to complete one spiral
    LEFT ANGLE ; Turn left by the set angle
    FORWARD DIST ; Move the turtle forward by the set distance
