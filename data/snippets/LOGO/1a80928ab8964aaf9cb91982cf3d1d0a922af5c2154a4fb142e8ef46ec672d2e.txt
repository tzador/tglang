; Procedure to draw a complex geometric pattern
; This procedure takes in 3 parameters - size, angle, and sides
; It recursively draws nested squares with alternating colors,
; with each square rotated by a given angle
; The pattern is completed when the number of sides is 1
; and the final square is filled with the last color

TO DRAW-PATTERN :SIZE :ANGLE :SIDES
  PU ; Pen up
  FD :SIZE/2 ; Move forward half the size
  RT :ANGLE ; Rotate right by given angle
  PD ; Pen down
  REPEAT 4 [
    IF :SIDES = 1 [
      FILL LASTCOLOR ; Fill the last square with the last color
    ]
    NEXTCOLOR ; Change to the next color
    FD :SIZE ; Draw forward with given size
    RT :ANGLE ; Rotate right by given angle
  ]
  PU ; Pen up
  BK :SIZE/2 ; Move backward half the size
  LT :ANGLE ; Rotate left by given angle
  REPEAT :SIDES [
    DRAW-PATTERN :SIZE/2 :(-:ANGLE) :SIDES/2 ; Recursively draw smaller squares
    FD :SIZE/2 ; Move forward half the size
    RT :ANGLE ; Rotate right by given angle
  ]
  LT :ANGLE ; Rotate left by given angle
  PD ; Pen down
