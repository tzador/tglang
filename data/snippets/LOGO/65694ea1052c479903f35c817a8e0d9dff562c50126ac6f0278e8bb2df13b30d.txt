; This code snippet will draw a spiral using recursive functions in the programming language LOGO.

to spiral :length :offset
  ; This recursive function takes in two parameters, the length of each segment and the offset for each turn.
  if :length > 1 [
    repeat 2 [
      forward :length
      right 90
      ; Drawing a square of length "length" and turning 90 degrees twice to create a right angle turn.
    ]
    right :offset
    spiral :length - 1 :offset
    ; Making a recursive call to the function with a decreased length and the same offset.
  ]
end

to drawSpiral :size
  ; This function takes in one parameter, the desired size of the final spiral.
  if :size > 0 [
    spiral :size (360 / :size)
    ; Calling the spiral function with the given size and a calculated offset for each turn.
    drawSpiral :size - 1
    ; Making a recursive call to the function with a decreased size.
  ]
end

drawSpiral 10
; Calling the drawSpiral function with a size of 10 to start drawing the spiral.
