; This is a LOGO code snippet that draws a spiral using recursion

; Define a recursive procedure to draw a spiral
to spiral :size :angle
  if :size > 0 [ ; base case: stop recursive loop when size is 0
    forward :size
    right :angle
    ; reduce the size and angle for each iteration
    spiral :size * 0.9 :angle * 0.95
  ]
end

; Set the starting position and angle
pu ; pen up, so no line is drawn
home ; go to starting position
pd ; pen down, so lines are drawn
setheading 0 ; set the starting angle to 0

; Call the recursive procedure to draw the spiral
spiral 100 15 ; pass initial size and angle values

; Below is the output of the code:
