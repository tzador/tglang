; This code snippet in LOGO draws a complex geometric pattern using loops and nested procedures

to drawPattern :size :angles  ; Defines a procedure to draw a single part of the pattern
  repeat 4 [  ; Loops 4 times to create all sides of the geometric shape
    forward :size  ; Moves the turtle forward by the specified size
    right :angles  ; Turns the turtle by the specified angle
  ]
end

to drawNestedPattern :size :angles  ; Nested procedure to create a more complex pattern
  drawPattern :size :angles  ; Calls the previously defined procedure to draw a single part of the pattern
  right 45  ; Turns the turtle by 45 degrees to create an offset
  drawPattern :size :angles  ; Calls the procedure again
  right :angles  ; Turns the turtle by the specified angle
  forward :size  ; Moves the turtle forward by the specified size
  drawPattern :size :angles  ; Calls the procedure again
  left 45  ; Turns the turtle back to its original position
end

to drawComplexPattern  ; Main procedure to draw the full complex pattern
  clearscreen  ; Clears the screen before drawing
  penup  ; Lifts up the pen to avoid drawing lines while moving the turtle
  setpos (random(300) - 150) (random(300) - 150)  ; Randomly positions the turtle on the screen within a specified range
  pendown  ; Puts the pen back down to start drawing
  repeat 10 [  ; Loops 10 times to create a grid of nested patterns
    repeat 10 [  ; Loops 10 times to create a row of nested patterns
      drawNestedPattern random(100) 15  ; Calls the nested procedure with randomly generated size and angle values
      penup  ; Lifts up the pen to avoid drawing lines while moving the turtle
      forward 100  ; Moves the turtle forward by a fixed amount to create the grid
      pendown  ; Puts the pen back down to start drawing
    ]
    penup  ; Lifts up the pen to avoid drawing lines while moving the turtle
    home  ; Sends the turtle back to its starting position
    right 90  ; Turns the turtle by 90 degrees to create an offset for the next row
    forward 100  ; Moves the turtle forward by a fixed amount to create the grid
    right 90  ; Turns the turtle back to its original position
    pendown  ; Puts the pen back down to start drawing the next row
  ]
end

drawComplexPattern  ; Calls the main procedure to draw the full complex pattern
