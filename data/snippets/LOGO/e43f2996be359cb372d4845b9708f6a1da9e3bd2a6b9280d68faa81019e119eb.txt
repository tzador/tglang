; This code snippet draws a spiral with changing colors using the pen and turtle commands
; Set initial variables
MAKE "LENGTH 5 ; length of each line segment
MAKE "TURN 10 ; angle to turn after drawing each line
MAKE "ROTATE 0 ; current rotation of turtle
MAKE "COLOR 1 ; current color index
MAKE "COLORS [1 2 3 4 5] ; list of available colors
MAKE "NUMCOLORS 5 ; number of available colors

; Define the spiral procedure
TO SPIRAL
  REPEAT 100 [ ; repeat the following 100 times
    ; Change color
    SETPC FIRST :COLORS + :COLOR ; set pen color to current color
  
    ; Draw a line segment, rotate turtle, and update variables
    FORWARD :LENGTH * (COUNT :COLORS) ; draw line segment with length based on color
    RIGHT :ROTATE ; rotate turtle
    SETROTATE :ROTATE + :TURN ; update rotation angle
    SETCOLOR :COLOR + 1 ; update color index
    IFELSE :COLOR = :NUMCOLORS [ ; if reached the end of color list, reset color index
      SETCOLOR 0
    ]
    [ ; otherwise, continue with current color
