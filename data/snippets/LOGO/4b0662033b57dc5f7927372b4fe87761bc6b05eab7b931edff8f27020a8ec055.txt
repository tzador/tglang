; Program to draw a spiral made of squares

; Set turtle drawing speed
speed [10]

; Define variables for sizes of squares
make "square-size 20
make "square-increment 1

; Define variables for initial coordinates
make "x 0
make "y 0

; Define initial angle and turn amount
make "angle 0
make "turn 5

; Set the pen color to blue
setpc [blue]

; Nested loops to draw spiral
repeat 18 [ ; Outer loop for number of squares
  fd :x ; Move forward by the current x coordinate
  rt :angle ; Rotate the turtle by the current angle
  repeat 4 [ ; Inner loop to draw square
    fd :square-size ; Move forward by the size of the square
    rt 90 ; Rotate the turtle by 90 degrees
  ]
  make "x :x + :square-increment ; Update x coordinate
  make "square-size :square-size + :square-increment ; Update square size
  make "angle :angle + :turn ; Update angle
