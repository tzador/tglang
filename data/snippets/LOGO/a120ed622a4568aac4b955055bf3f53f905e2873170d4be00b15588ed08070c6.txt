; This is a procedure named "STARFISH" which draws a starfish shape.
; It uses 5 nested for loops to create 5 arms, each consisting of 5 lines.
; The first line moves the turtle forward by 50 units.
; Then, the inner for loop executes 5 times, each time moving the turtle forward by 10 units and turning it left by 144 degrees.
; After completing the inner for loop, the turtle turns right by 144 degrees and repeats the process 4 more times to complete the starfish shape.
; The code ends with the "END" command, marking the end of the procedure.
