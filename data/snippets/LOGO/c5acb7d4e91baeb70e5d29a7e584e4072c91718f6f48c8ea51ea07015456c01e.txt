; This is a Logo code snippet that draws a complex pattern

; Set up the turtle's position and direction
setxy 0 0
setheading 90

; Loop to create multiple shapes
repeat 36 [
  pu ; Pen up
  fd 20 ; Move forward by 20 units
  
  ; Begin shape
  pd ; Pen down
  repeat 360 [ ; Loop to create a circle
    fd 2 * :repcount ; Move forward by 2 times the current repeat count
    rt 1 ; Turn right by 1 degree
  ]
  ; End shape
  
  pu ; Pen up
  bk 20 ; Move backward by 20 units
  rt 10 ; Turn right by 10 degrees

; Move turtle to new position
setxy 100 100

; Begin recursive function

  ; Begin shape
