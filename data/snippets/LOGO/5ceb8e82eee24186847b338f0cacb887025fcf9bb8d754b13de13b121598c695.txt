; This code uses LOGO to create a snowflake shape made out of triangles.

; Set the initial angle for drawing: (Note: "rt" stands for "right turn", and "lt" stands for "left turn")
setheading 30

; Move forward to create the center triangle:
forward 16

; Create the first triangle, with its base forming the top of the snowflake:
repeat 3 [
  forward 16
  rt 120
]

; Move to the second triangle's starting position:
penup
forward 16
left 150
pendown

; Create the second triangle:
repeat 3 [
  forward 16
  rt 120 
]

; Repeat this process to create a total of 6 triangles around the center one:
repeat 5 [
  penup
  forward 16
  left 120
  pendown
  repeat 3 [
    forward 16
    rt 120
  ]
  
  ; Return to the center triangle's starting position:
  penup
  left 120
  forward 16
  rt 30
  pendown
]

; Move back to the center triangle to complete the snowflake:
penup
backward 16
rt 30
pendown
repeat 3 [
  forward 16
  rt 120
]
