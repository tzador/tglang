; This program draws a spiral using the REPEAT command.
; The outer REPEAT loop controls the number of edges of the spiral.
; The inner REPEAT loop controls the distance moved by the turtle in each step.

REPEAT 360 [ ; Outer loop with 360 iterations for a full circle
  REPEAT 60 [ ; Inner loop with 60 iterations to create a spiral shape
    FORWARD 10 * REPCOUNT ; Turtle moves forward by 10 units times the current iteration count
    RIGHT 5 ; Turtle turns right by 5 degrees in each step
  ]
  RIGHT 5 ; After inner loop, turtle turns right again by 5 degrees
