; This program draws a spiral using a recursive algorithm.

to spiral :length :angle  ; define procedure with two inputs
    if :length < 1 [stop] ; base case, stop when length is less than 1
    fd :length   ; move forward by the input length
    rt :angle    ; turn right by the input angle
    spiral (1 - :length / 100) (2 * :angle) ; recursive call with updated inputs
end

spiral 200 90 ; call the procedure with initial values of length and angle
