; This is a code snippet in LOGO that creates a spiral design
; Start by setting the turtle shape to a triangle
setshape "triangle

; Set starting position and heading for the turtle
setxy 0 0
seth 180

; Define the spiral function
to spiral
  fd 10 ; Move turtle forward 10 units
  rt 2 ; Turn turtle to the right 2 degrees
  spiral ; Repeat the function
end

; Use a recursive function to create the spiral design
to spiraldesign :size
  if :size < 1 [stop] ; Stop when size is less than 1
  pu ; Pen up, so no line is drawn
  bk :size ; Move turtle back by the given size
  pd ; Pen down, so lines can be drawn
  spiral ; Call the spiral function
  spiraldesign :size-1 ; Call the function again with a smaller size
end

; Call the spiraldesign function with a starting size of 100
