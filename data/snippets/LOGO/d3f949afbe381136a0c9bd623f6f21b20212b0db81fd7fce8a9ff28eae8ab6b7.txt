;; This code snippet creates a logo procedure called "SQUARE" that takes in a parameter called "SIDE".
;; It repeats the code within brackets 4 times, each time moving forward by distance "SIDE" and rotating right by 90 degrees.
;; This effectively draws a square with sides equal to "SIDE".
;; There is also a procedure called "POLYGON" that takes in two parameters, "SIDES" and "LENGTH".
;; It repeats the code within brackets "SIDES" times, each time moving forward by distance "LENGTH" and rotating right by 360 degrees divided by "SIDES".
;; This effectively draws a regular polygon with "SIDES" number of sides and each side having a length of "LENGTH".
;; The "SPIRAL" procedure takes in a number called "NUM" and repeats the code within brackets "NUM" times.
;; Each time it moves forward by a fixed distance of 10 and rotates right by 360 degrees divided by "NUM".
;; This creates a spiral shape.
;; Finally, the "SQUARE-SPIRAL" procedure takes in a number "NUM" and repeats the code within brackets "NUM" times.
;; Each time it calls the "SQUARE" procedure with a side length of 10 and then calls the "SPIRAL" procedure with a "NUM" value of 10.
;; This effectively draws a spiral made up of squares.
