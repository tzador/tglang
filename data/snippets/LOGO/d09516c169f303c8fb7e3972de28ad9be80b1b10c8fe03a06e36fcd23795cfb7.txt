;This code snippet draws a spiral design using a recursive function

;Create a procedure named "spiral" that takes in two parameters: "length" and "angle"
to spiral :length :angle

;If the length is greater than or equal to 0, then:
if :length >= 0 [

;Draw a line with the given length
fd :length

;Turn the turtle by the given angle
rt :angle

;Decrease the length by 5
make "length :length - 5

;Call the "spiral" procedure recursively with the updated length and angle
spiral :length :angle
]

;End the procedure
end

;Make the turtle's speed faster
speed 0

;Call the "spiral" procedure with initial length of 100 and angle of 90
spiral 100 90
