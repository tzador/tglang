REPEAT 4 [RT 90
       ANGLE(3 * 7)
       FORWARD (50 + 25 / SQRT 3)]
; This code snippet draws a complex spiral shape using the LOGO programming language.
; The REPEAT command loops through the code 4 times, rotating the turtle (RT) by 90 degrees each time.
; The ANGLE command calculates the angle of the next line segment using the formula 3 * 7, which evaluates to 21 degrees.
; The FORWARD command moves the turtle forward by a distance of 50 + 25 divided by the square root of 3. This creates a spiral shape as the distance increases with each iteration.
