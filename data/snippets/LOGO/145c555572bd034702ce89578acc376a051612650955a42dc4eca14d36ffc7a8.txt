;This code snippet draws a complex pattern in LOGO language
;It uses colors, loops, and functions to create a dynamic and visually interesting design
to pattern
  ;function to draw a repeated pattern
  repeat 4 [
    ;loop to iterate through each quadrant
    set color random [1 15]
    ;sets random color for each quadrant
    repeat 100 [
      ;loop to draw 100 lines
      fd 50 ;move forward 50 pixels
      rt random 90 ;turn right randomly between 0 and 90 degrees
      pu ;pen up to stop drawing
      setxy random -200 200 random -200 200 ;set random coordinates within the range of -200 to 200
      pd ;pen down to start drawing
      set color random [1 15] ;set a new random color
