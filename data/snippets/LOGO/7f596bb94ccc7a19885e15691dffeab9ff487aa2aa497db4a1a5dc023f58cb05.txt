; This code snippet creates a fractal tree using recursive procedures and turtle graphics

; Define the base procedure for creating a branch
TO branch :length :level
    IF :level = 0       ; Check if the current level is 0
        [FD :length]    ; If yes, move forward by the given length
    ELSE
        [                 
            FD :length               ; Move forward by the given length
            RT 30                    ; Turn right by 30 degrees
            branch :length * 0.8 :level - 1 ; Call the branch procedure with a shorter length and lower level
            LT 60                    ; Turn left by 60 degrees
            branch :length * 0.6 :level - 1 ; Call the branch procedure with an even shorter length and lower level
            RT 30                    ; Turn right by 30 degrees
            PU                      ; Lift the pen up
            BK :length              ; Move backward by the given length
            PD                      ; Put the pen down again
        ]
end

; Define the main procedure for creating the fractal tree
TO tree :length :level
    PU              ; Lift the pen up
    BK :length / 2  ; Move backwards by half the given length
    PD              ; Put the pen down again
    branch :length :level  ; Call the branch procedure to create the first level
end

; Call the tree procedure with the desired length and level
