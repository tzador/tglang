TO SQUARE :LENGTH
  REPEAT 4 [ FORWARD :LENGTH RIGHT 90 ]
END

; this code snippet defines a procedure named "SQUARE" with one parameter, "LENGTH".
; It uses the built-in "REPEAT" command to repeat a set of instructions four times.
; The instructions include the built-in "FORWARD" command, which moves the turtle forward by the value of the "LENGTH" parameter, 
; and the "RIGHT" command, which rotates the turtle by 90 degrees.
; The procedure ends with the "END" command.

; To use this procedure, we can call it and provide a value for the "LENGTH" parameter.
; For example, the following code will create a square with a side length of 100:

SQUARE 100

; The output of this code would be a square shape created by the turtle, with each side being 100 units long.
