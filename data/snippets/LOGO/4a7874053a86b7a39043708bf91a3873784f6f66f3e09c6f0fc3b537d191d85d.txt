; This code snippet creates a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
; Assumes variable "num" holds the number whose factorial we want to find

TO FACTORIAL :num
  IF :num = 0 [         ; base case
    OUTPUT 1
  ]
  IF :num > 0 [         ; recursive case
    OUTPUT :num * FACTORIAL :num - 1
  ]
END

; Example usage of the function:
; Prints the factorial of 5, which should be 120
PRINT FACTORIAL 5

; Output: 120
