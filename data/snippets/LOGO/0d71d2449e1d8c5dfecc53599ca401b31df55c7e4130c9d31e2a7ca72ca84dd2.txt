;This code snippet creates a fractal pattern using recursive functions
;Define the base case
To fractal :size :level
  If :level = 0 [ ;if the level reaches 0, stop the recursion and draw a small square
    Square :size
  ]
  ;Apply a pattern using four smaller versions of the original size
  Repeat 4 [ ;repeat the following code four times
    fractal :size/2 (:level - 1) ;recursively call the function with halved size and one less level
    Forward :size ;move forward by the current size
    Right 90 ;turn right by 90 degrees
  ]
End

;Set the initial size and level of recursion
Make "initial-size 100 ;can be changed to any desired size
Make "levels 3 ;can be changed to any desired number of levels

;Execute the function with the given parameters
fractal :initial-size :levels

;Save the resulting image to a file
