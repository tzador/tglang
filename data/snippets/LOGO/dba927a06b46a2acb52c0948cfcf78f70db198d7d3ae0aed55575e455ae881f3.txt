to spiral :length :angle 
  if :length < 1 [stop] ; stop if length is less than 1 
  fd :length ; move forward by length 
  rt :angle ; turn right by angle 
  spiral :length * .9 :angle ; call the procedure again with a decreased length and same angle 
  ; the following code will execute after the above spiral procedure stops 
  lt :angle ; turn left by angle
