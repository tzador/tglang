; Below is a LOGO program that draws a spiral
; First, set the turtle's properties
SETANGLE 90 ; Sets the turtle's initial angle to 90 degrees
SETXY 100 100 ; Sets the turtle's starting point to (100, 100)

; Define the procedure for drawing a spiral
TO DRAW-SPIRAL :LENGTH :ANGLE
IF :LENGTH < 10 [STOP] ; Base case - stop drawing when length is less than 10
FORWARD :LENGTH ; Moves the turtle forward by the specified length
RIGHT :ANGLE ; Turns the turtle to the right by the specified angle
DRAW-SPIRAL :LENGTH * 0.9 :ANGLE ; Recursive call with a smaller length and same angle
END

; Calls the DRAW-SPIRAL procedure with an initial length of 100 and angle of 30
DRAW-SPIRAL 100 30

; Here, the turtle will keep drawing smaller and smaller spirals until the length is less than 10, creating a spiral effect.
