; This code snippet will create a function called "shape" that draws a spiral
; It takes in two parameters - "size" to determine the size of the spiral and "angle" to determine the angle of rotation

to shape :size :angle
  repeat size [     ; repeats the following commands as many times as the value of "size"
    forward :size   ; moves forward by the value of "size" pixels
    right :angle    ; rotates right by the value of "angle" degrees
  ]
end
