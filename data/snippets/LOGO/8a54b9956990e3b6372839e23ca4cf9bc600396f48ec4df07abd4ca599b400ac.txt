; This is a complex code snippet in LOGO that draws a colorful shape
; It starts by setting the speed, pen size, and pen color
set_speed 10
set_pen_size 3
set_pen_color "red

; Next, it uses a loop to draw multiple sides of the shape
repeat 8 [
  ; The turtle turns a specific angle and moves forward to create the shape
  rt 45
  fd 80
  ; It then changes the pen color to create a gradient effect
  set_pen_color (list (random 255) (random 255) (random 255))
]

; Finally, it ends by filling the shape with a random color
fill (list (random 255) (random 255) (random 255))
