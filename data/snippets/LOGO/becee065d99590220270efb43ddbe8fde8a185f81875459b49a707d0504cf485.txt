; Define the procedure "square" which takes in a parameter "size"
; This procedure draws a square with length "size" using a turtle.

to square :size
  ; Set the turtle's pen color to red
  setpencolor "red

  ; Start drawing the square
  repeat 4 [
    forward :size ; Move the turtle forward by "size" units
    right 90 ; Turn the turtle by 90 degrees to create a right angle
    ]

  ; Set the pen color to green after drawing the square
  setpencolor "green
end

; Call the procedure "square" with a parameter of 100
square 100

; Define the procedure "repeat_square" which takes in a parameter "num"
; This procedure repeats the "square" procedure "num" times,
; each time decreasing the size by 10 units.

to repeat_square :num
  ; Set initial size to 100 units
  make "size 100

  ; Repeat "num" times
  repeat :num [
    square :size ; Call the procedure "square" with the current size
    make "size :size - 10 ; Decrease the size by 10 units
  ]
end

; Call the procedure "repeat_square" with a parameter of 5
repeat_square 5
