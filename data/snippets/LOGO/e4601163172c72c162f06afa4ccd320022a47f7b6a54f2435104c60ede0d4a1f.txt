;; This code snippet generates a snowflake shape using recursive turtle graphics.

;; Set turtle speed to fastest
;; Zero is the slowest and ten is the fastest
;; The higher the number, the faster the turtle moves
settp [3 10]

;; Define a procedure to draw one branch of the snowflake
;; Takes in the length of the branch
;; Uses recursion to draw a smaller branch at the end of each branch
;; Ends when the length is less than 10
;; This creates the fractal effect of the snowflake
