; This code snippet creates a procedure that draws a spiral shape
; with different colors based on the angle of rotation.

to spiral :length :angle :color
  if :angle = 360 [stop]
  rt :angle
  fd :length
  setcolor :color
  spiral :length :angle + 5 :color + 10
end

; This procedure calls the spiral procedure with an initial length of 50,
; an initial angle of 10, and a starting color of 50.
