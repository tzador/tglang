to spiral
  ; This procedure draws a spiral using turtle graphics
  ; Assumes the turtle is facing right at the starting position
  repeat 100 [
    forward repcount * 2 ; Move forward (multiplied by current repcount)
    right 90            ; Turn right 90 degrees
    forward repcount * 2
    right 90
  ]
end

to random-polygon :sides :length
  ; This procedure draws a random polygon of specified sides and length
  ; Assumes the turtle is facing right at the starting position
  make "angle 360 / :sides ; Calculate the angle to turn by for each side
  repeat :sides [
    forward :length          ; Move forward by specified length
    right random 180         ; Turn right by a random amount between 0 and 180 degrees
    forward :length * 0.5    ; Move forward by half the specified length
    right (random 90) / 2    ; Turn right by a random amount between 0 and 45 degrees
  ]
end

to star :size :points
  ; This procedure draws a star of specified size and number of points
  ; Assumes the turtle is facing up at the starting position
  make "angle 360 / :points ; Calculate the angle to turn by for each point
  repeat :points [          ; Repeat for specified number of points
    repeat 2 [              ; Draw a line and turn right twice for each point
      forward :size        ; Move forward by specified size
      right :angle         ; Turn right by calculated angle
    ]
    backward :size * 0.5    ; Move backward by half the specified size
    right :angle            ; Turn right by calculated angle
