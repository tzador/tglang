;; This code generates a Koch snowflake, a fractal shape with six sides

;; Set up the starting position and initial shape
setpos [0 -40]
setshape "leaves

;; Define a procedure to draw one side of the snowflake
to koch
  ;; Draw a straight line segment
  forward 50
  ;; Rotate 60 degrees to the right
  right 60
  ;; Draw another line segment
  forward 25
  ;; Rotate 120 degrees to the left
  left 120
  ;; Draw a third line segment
  forward 25
  ;; Rotate 60 degrees to the right
  right 60
  ;; Draw a final line segment
  forward 50
end

;; Define a procedure to recursively draw the rest of the snowflake
to koch-repeat :count
  ;; Base case: when count is 0, stop repeating
  if :count = 0 [stop]
  ;; Otherwise, draw one side of the snowflake
  koch
  ;; Save the current position and heading
  savepos "pos
  saveheading "heading
  ;; Turn 60 degrees to the left
  left 60
  ;; Reduce the count by 1
  koch-repeat :count - 1
  ;; Restore the saved position and heading
  setpos :pos
  setheading :heading
  ;; Turn 120 degrees to the right
  right 120
  ;; Reduce the count by 1
  koch-repeat :count - 1
  ;; Restore the saved position and heading
  setpos :pos
  setheading :heading
  ;; Turn 60 degrees to the left
  left 60
  ;; Reduce the count by 1
  koch-repeat :count - 1
end

;; Call the recursive procedure to draw the complete snowflake
