; This code snippet uses the LOGO programming language to draw a complex pattern.
; It creates a turtle-shaped cursor and uses a loop to draw a series of circles of varying sizes, colors, and positions.

; `make "turtle shape "turtle` initializes the cursor as a turtle shape.
; `repeat 100 [ ... ]` is a loop that will run the code inside it 100 times.
; `setcolor []` sets the color of the cursor to the specified color.
; `setpos [] []` sets the position of the cursor to the specified coordinates.
; `make "size random 10` generates a random number from 1 to 10 and stores it in a variable called "size".
; `ifelse [] [...] [... ]`: if the condition in the first empty square brackets is true, the code in the second square brackets will run, otherwise the code in the third square brackets will run.

; The code inside the loop draws circles of random sizes and colors.
