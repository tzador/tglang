; This code snippet draws a complex spiral shape using recursion in LOGO language
; 'draw-spiral' procedure takes in two parameters - 'length' and 'angle', and draws a line with the given length and turns by the given angle
; after drawing the line, the 'length' is reduced by 1 and the 'angle' is increased by 10 degrees
; this process continues until the length is less than 5 pixels

to draw-spiral :length :angle
  if :length < 5 [stop]
  forward :length
  right :angle
  draw-spiral :length - 1 :angle + 10 ; recursive call
end

  draw-spiral 200 0 ; call the 'draw-spiral' procedure with initial length of 200 pixels and no angle
