; This code snippet draws a spiral square using recursion

; Define a procedure to draw a square
TO SQUARE
  REPEAT 4 ; Repeat 4 times to create the four sides of the square
    FD 100 ; Move forward 100 units
    RT 90 ; Turn right 90 degrees
  END

; Define a procedure to call itself recursively to draw the spiral square
TO SPIRAL :N
  IF :N > 0 ; Base case: If N is greater than 0, continue drawing the square
    THEN
      SQUARE ; Call the SQUARE procedure to draw a square
      RT 10 ; Turn right by 10 degrees to create a spiral effect
      SPIRAL :N - 1 ; Call the SPIRAL procedure again with N-1
  END
  
; Set an initial value for N
SETSPIRAL 10

; Call the SPIRAL procedure to draw the spiral square
SPIRAL :N
