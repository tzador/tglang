; This is a simple program that draws a spiral using the turtle

to spiral
  ; Start by setting the pen up and changing the pen color to red
  penup
  setpencolor 9

  ; Move the turtle to the center of the screen
  setposition [0 0]

  ; Define variables for the length of each segment, starting length, and angle
  make "len 10
  make "start 5
  make "angle 15

  ; Use a for loop to repeat the following steps 100 times
  repeat 100 [
    ; Set the pen down to start drawing
    pendown

    ; Move the turtle forward by the current length
    forward :len

    ; Increase the length of each segment and turn the turtle by the current angle
    make "len :len + :start
    right :angle

    ; Increase the start length and decrease the angle
    make "start :start + 1
    make "angle :angle - 1

    ; Raise the pen to stop drawing
    penup
  ]
end

; Call the spiral function to draw the spiral
