; This code snippet draws a spiral shape using recursive procedures in LOGO

TO spiral :size :angle :incr
  IF :size < 1 [STOP] ; stops the recursion when size gets too small
  FD :size ; moves forward in the direction the turtle is currently facing
  RT :angle ; rotates the turtle to the right by the specified angle
  spiral :size - :incr :angle :incr ; recursively calls the spiral procedure with a smaller size and incremented angle
  RT :incr ; rotates the turtle to the right again
  FD :size ; moves forward in the direction the turtle is currently facing
END

REPEAT 10 ; repeat the following procedures 10 times
  [spiral 100 90 10]
