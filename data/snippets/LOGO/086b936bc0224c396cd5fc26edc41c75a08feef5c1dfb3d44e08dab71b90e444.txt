; This code snippet creates a Koch snowflake fractal using recursion in LOGO programming language

TO KOCH :LENGTH :LEVEL

    FD :LENGTH
  ]
  ELSE [                        ; recursive case, use relative motion and turn 60 degrees after every recursion
    KOCH :LENGTH / 3 :LEVEL - 1 ; call recursive function with 1/3 length and 1 level less
    RT 60

TO SNOWFLAKE :LENGTH :LEVEL
  REPEAT 3 [
    KOCH :LENGTH :LEVEL    ; draw initial triangle with 3 Koch snowflakes as sides
    RT 120
  ]
END

SNOWFLAKE 100 4   ; draw a Koch snowflake fractal with initial length of 100 and 4 levels of recursion (can be changed for different sizes)
