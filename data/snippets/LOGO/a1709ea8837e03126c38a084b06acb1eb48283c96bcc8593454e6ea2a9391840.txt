to draw-spiral
  ; This procedure draws a spiral shape using a recursive approach
  ; Inputs:
  ;   - side-size: the size of each side of the spiral
  ;   - num-sides: the number of sides in the spiral
  ;   - angle: the angle at each turn in the spiral
  ;   - starting-x: the starting x-coordinate of the spiral
  ;   - starting-y: the starting y-coordinate of the spiral
  
  ; base case - when the number of sides is 0, stop the recursion
  ifelse (num-sides = 0) [stop]
  
  ; calculate the new x-coordinate after each turn using trigonometry
  make "new-x starting-x + (side-size * cos(angle * 3.14159 / 180))
  
  ; calculate the new y-coordinate after each turn using trigonometry
  make "new-y starting-y + (side-size * sin(angle * 3.14159 / 180))
  
  ; draw a line from the starting point to the new point
  ; each iteration of the recursion will draw one side of the spiral
  pd
  ; set the pen size to the same as the side size for consistency
  ; you can also use the side size as a variable for more customization
  ; and change it with each iteration to create a tapered or thickening spiral
  setpensize side-size
  ; use "repeat" to draw the next side of the spiral
  repeat 1 [fd side-size]
  
  ; recursive step - call the procedure again with the updated coordinates
  draw-spiral side-size (num-sides - 1) angle :new-x :new-y
end

; call the procedure with the desired inputs
