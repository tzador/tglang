; This code will draw a spiral shape using the turtle in LOGO
; Set the turtle's speed to fastest for a quicker execution
setturtle speed fastest

; Use 'for' loop to move the turtle forward and turn it at the same time
for [i 1 100] [
  fd :i  ; 'fd' stands for 'forward', use current value of 'i' as distance
  rt 90  ; 'rt' stands for 'right turn', turn turtle by 90 degrees
]

; Increase the distance by 2 each time
set :i (i + 2)

; Use 'for' loop again to continue drawing spiral with increased distance
for [j 1 100] [
  fd :j
  rt 90
]

; Use 'for' loop one more time to draw final straight line
for [k 1 100] [
  fd 200  ; set larger value as this will be the final line
