; This program demonstrates the use of recursion to draw a spiral
; A recursive function is defined to draw each line of the spiral
; The function is called with different parameters to draw different sizes of spiral

TO draw_spiral :size :angle
  ; If size is smaller than 1, end recursion
  IF :size < 1 [STOP]
  ; Draw a line with given size and angle
  FORWARD :size
  RIGHT :angle
  ; Call function again with half the size and increased angle,
  ; creating a smaller spiral
  draw_spiral :size / 2 (:angle + 1)
END

; Set starting position and angle
