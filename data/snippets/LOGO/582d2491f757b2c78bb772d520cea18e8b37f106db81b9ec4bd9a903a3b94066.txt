; This is a complex LOGO code snippet that draws a spiral

; Size of the spiral
make "size 50
; Angle of rotation
make "angle 90
; Initial position
make "x 0
make "y 0

; Set pen width and color
setwidth 2
setcolor "blue

; Define the procedure to draw a line
to line :length
  fd :length
end

; Define the procedure to draw a spiral
to spiral
  ; Keep track of the number of times the spiral is drawn
  make "count 0

  ; Loop until the spiral reaches the desired size
  repeat :size [
    ; Increase the length of the line for each iteration
    make "length :count
    ; Draw the line
    line :length
    ; Increase the angle of rotation
    rt :angle
    ; Increase the count
    make "count :count + 1
  ]
end

; Set the pen position to the initial position
