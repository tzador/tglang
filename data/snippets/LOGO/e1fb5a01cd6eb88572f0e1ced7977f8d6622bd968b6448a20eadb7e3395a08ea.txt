; This is a complex code snippet in LOGO
; It uses multiple variables, loops, and conditional statements

to draw-spiral
  make "length 10 ; set the initial length of the line
  make "angle 60 ; set the initial angle of the line
  
  ; start a loop that will run 100 times
  repeat 100 [
    make "color random 15 ; set the color of the line to a random shade
    make "width :length / 3 ; set the width of the line
    if :length < 200 [ ; check if the length is less than 200
      make "length :length + 10 ; increase the length by 10
    ]
    rt :angle ; turn the turtle to the right by the specified angle
    fd :length ; move the turtle forward by the specified length
  ]
end

; initialize the turtle
turtlesetxy 0 0 ; set the starting position of the turtle
penup ; lift the pen up to prevent the turtle from drawing
pencolor "white ; set the pen color to white
hideturtle ; hide the turtle from view

; call the draw-spiral procedure to draw the spiral
