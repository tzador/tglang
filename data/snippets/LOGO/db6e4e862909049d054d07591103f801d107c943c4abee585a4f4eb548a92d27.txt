; This code snippet draws a spiral using the turtle in LOGO

; Define a procedure to draw a single line segment of the spiral
TO line :distance :angle :count
  ; Set the turtle's heading and move forward
  SETHEADING :angle
  FORWARD :distance 
  
  ; Decrease the distance for the next line segment
  IF :distance > 1 [SET :distance :distance - :count]
  
  ; Increase the angle for the next line segment
  SET :angle :angle + 10
  
  ; Stop when the distance becomes too small
  IF :distance < 1 [STOP]
  
  ; Repeat the procedure until the distance is too small
  REPEAT 20 [line :distance :angle :count]
END
