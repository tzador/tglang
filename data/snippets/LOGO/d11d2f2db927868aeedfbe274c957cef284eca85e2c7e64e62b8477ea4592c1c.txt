; This function draws a fractal pattern using recursive calls. It takes in two parameters - size and angle.
; The initial size and angle can be adjusted to change the overall shape of the pattern.
; The code first checks if the size is less than 1, if so, it stops the recursion.
; If not, it moves forward by the size, rotates right by the angle, and then recursively calls the function with smaller size and angle values.
; After each recursive call, it rotates left by the angle * 2 and calls the function again with a smaller size and a larger angle. This creates a spiral effect.
; The process is repeated several times, with different size and angle values, to create an intricate fractal pattern.
; The code is formatted using indentation for better readability.
