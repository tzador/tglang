// The above code snippet will draw a square with a size of 100 pixels.
// The 'to' keyword starts a procedure or function in LOGO.
// The procedure 'draw-square' takes in an input variable 'size'.
// The 'forward' command moves the turtle forward by the number of steps specified.
// The 'right' command turns the turtle to the right by the number of degrees specified.
// The 'end' keyword terminates a procedure or function.
// The 'setheading' command sets the angle of the turtle to the specified direction.
// The code output in this case will be a square with a size of 100 pixels and its bottom edge facing towards the left.
