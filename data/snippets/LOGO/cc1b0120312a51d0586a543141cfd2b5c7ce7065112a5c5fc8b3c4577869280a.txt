TO SQUARESPIRAL :SIDE :ANGLE :LENGTH :ROTATIONS 
  ; This procedure draws a square spiral with given parameters
  REPEAT :ROTATIONS [
    REPEAT 4 [
      FORWARD :LENGTH
      RIGHT :ANGLE
      ] 
      ; The above code repeats 4 times, creating a square
      ; with each side length of :LENGTH and rotated by :ANGLE degrees
    FORWARD :LENGTH / 2 
    ; This moves the turtle halfway in preparation for the next rotation
    RIGHT :ANGLE 
    ; This rotates the turtle for the next square
    SET :LENGTH :LENGTH + :SIDE 
    ; Increases the length of each side by :SIDE
    SET :ANGLE :ANGLE + 5
    ; Increases the angle of rotation by 5 degrees
  ]
END

TO SQUARESPIRALOUTER :SIDE :ANGLE :LENGTH :ROTATIONS 
  ; This procedure draws multiple square spirals by calling SQUARESPIRAL
  REPEAT 5 [
    ; Calls SQUARESPIRAL with different parameters each time
    SQUARESPIRAL :SIDE :ANGLE :LENGTH :ROTATIONS 
    FORWARD :SIDE 
    ; Moves the turtle to the starting position of the next spiral
    SETROTATION 90 
    ; Rotates the turtle to prepare for the next spiral
    SETLENGTH :LENGTH + :SIDE * 2 
    ; Increases the overall length for the next spiral
  ]
END

TO MAIN
  ; This is the main procedure that starts the LOGO program
  HIDETURTLE 
  ; Hides the turtle to improve performance
  SETXY 0 0 
  ; Moves the turtle to the center of the screen
  SETPENCOLOR [RED] 
  ; Sets the pen color to red
  SQUARESPIRALOUTER 50 90 50 10 
  ; Calls SQUARESPIRALOUTER with the given parameters
