; This program draws a spiral using the turtle graphics in LOGO

; Define procedures for moving and turning the turtle
TO MOVE :DIST FORWARD
    FD :DIST
END

TO TURN :ANGLE DEGREES
    RT :ANGLE
END

; Set initial values for the spiral
MAKE "ANGLE 5
MAKE "DIST 25
MAKE "LENGTH 5
MAKE "MAX 300
MAKE "INCREMENT 10

; Create a loop that repeats the steps for drawing the spiral
REPEAT :MAX [
    TURN :ANGLE
    FORWARD :DIST
    MAKE "DIST :DIST + :INCREMENT
    IF :DIST > :MAX [MAKE "DIST 25]
    MAKE "LENGTH :LENGTH + 5
