; This code snippet draws a spiral in the LOGO programming language

; Setting the initial conditions
setxy 0 0 ; move the turtle to the center
setheading 0 ; set the initial heading angle to 0 (facing east)
setpencolor 255 ; set the pen color to white
setpensize 4 ; set the pen size to 4 pixels

; Drawing the spiral using a loop
repeat 72 [
  repeat 5 [
    forward 10 ; move forward 10 units
    right 15 ; turn right by 15 degrees
  ]
  right 5 ; turn right by 5 degrees for the next iteration
]

; Shifting the spiral to the right
setxy 50 0 ; move the turtle 50 units to the right
setheading 180 ; turn the turtle to face west

; Drawing the mirror image of the spiral using a loop
repeat 72 [
  repeat 5 [
    forward 10 ; move forward 10 units
    left 15 ; turn left by 15 degrees
  ]
  left 5 ; turn left by 5 degrees for the next iteration
]

; Resetting the turtle's initial position and heading
setxy 0 0 ; move the turtle back to the center
setheading 0 ; set the initial heading angle to 0 (facing east)

; Shifting the spiral downwards
setxy 0 -50 ; move the turtle 50 units downwards
setheading 90 ; turn the turtle to face north

; Drawing the bottom half of the spiral using a loop
repeat 72 [
  repeat 5 [
    forward 10 ; move forward 10 units
    right 15 ; turn right by 15 degrees
  ]
  right 5 ; turn right by 5 degrees for the next iteration
]

; Shifting the spiral to the left
setxy -50 0 ; move the turtle 50 units to the left
setheading 0 ; turn the turtle to face east

; Drawing the left half of the spiral using a loop
repeat 72 [
  repeat 5 [
    forward 10 ; move forward 10 units
    left 15 ; turn left by 15 degrees
  ]
  left 5 ; turn left by 5 degrees for the next iteration
]

; Shifting the spiral to the top right corner
setxy 50 -50 ; move the turtle 50 units to the top right corner
setheading 225 ; turn the turtle to the top right diagonal direction

; Drawing the top right quarter of the spiral using a loop
repeat 36 [
  repeat 5 [
    forward 10 ; move forward 10 units
    right 15 ; turn right by 15 degrees
  ]
  right 5 ; turn right by 5 degrees for the next iteration
]

; Shifting the spiral to the bottom left corner
setxy -50 50 ; move the turtle 50 units to the bottom left corner
setheading 45 ; turn the turtle to the bottom left diagonal direction

; Drawing the bottom left quarter of the spiral using a loop
repeat 36 [
  repeat 5 [
    forward 10 ; move forward 10 units
    left 15 ; turn left by 15 degrees
  ]
  left 5 ; turn left by 5 degrees for the next iteration
]

; End of code snippet. The final output will be a spiral made up of four mirrored and rotated quarters, forming a symmetrical shape.
