; This code snippet creates a spiral

make "length 10         ; sets the initial length of each side
make "angle 20          ; sets the angle of each turn
make "size 200          ; sets the overall size of the spiral

penup                   ; lifts the pen to avoid drawing initial line
setxy 0 0               ; moves turtle to starting position
pendown                 ; puts pen back down to draw

repeat 30 [             ; repeats the following code 30 times
  forward :length       ; moves turtle forward by specified length
  right :angle          ; turns turtle to the right by specified angle
  set "length (:length + 5)   ; increases the length by 5 each time
  set "angle (:angle + 5)     ; increases the angle by 5 each time
