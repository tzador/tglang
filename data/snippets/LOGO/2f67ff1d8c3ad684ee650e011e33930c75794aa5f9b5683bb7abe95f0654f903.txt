;This code snippet uses the LOGO programming language to draw a complex shape
;Define the size of the shape
setsize 100

;Define the number of sides of the shape
setnsides 8

;Define the angle at which each side of the shape will be drawn
setangle 45

;Define the color of the shape
setcolor "red

;Define the starting position of the shape
setxy 0 0

;Start drawing the shape
pd

;Loop through the number of sides
loop [seti 1 [nsides] 1 [
  ;Draw a forward line
  fd size
  ;Rotate the turtle by the set angle
  rt angle]
;End loop

;Close the shape
