; This code snippet creates a rotating square with colorful edges and a spinning circle inside
; It uses the repeat loop and color palette commands to achieve the desired result

to spin-sq ;; procedure to create rotating square
    repeat 360 [ ;; repeat loop to create 360 angles for rotation
        setpc random 15 ;; set pen color to a random shade from color palette
        fd 50 ;; move forward by 50 steps
        rt 90 ;; turn right by 90 degrees
    ]
end

to spin-circle ;; procedure to create spinning circle
    repeat 360 [ ;; repeat loop to create 360 angles for rotation
        setpc random 15 ;; set pen color to a random shade from color palette
        circle 50 ;; draw a circle with radius of 50
        lt 1 ;; turn left by 1 degree to create spinning effect
    ]
end

repeat 4 [ ;; repeat loop to create 4 squares with different colors
    setpc random 15 ;; set pen color to a random shade from color palette
    spin-sq ;; call the procedure to create spinning square
    setpc random 15 ;; set pen color to a random shade from color palette
    spin-circle ;; call the procedure to create spinning circle
    rt 90 ;; turn right by 90 degrees to rotate the entire figure
