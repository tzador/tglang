;This program draws a spiral using procedures and recursion.

;Define a procedure to draw a single side of the spiral
to side :side-length
  if :side-length < 10 [stop]  ;stop drawing if the side-length is less than 10
  fd :side-length              ;move forward by the given side-length
  rt 90                        ;turn right by 90 degrees
  side :side-length - 5         ;call the procedure again with a smaller side-length
end

;Define a procedure to draw the entire spiral
to spiral :size
  if :size < 10 [stop]          ;stop drawing if the size is less than 10
  side :size                    ;call the side procedure with the given size
  spiral :size - 20             ;call the spiral procedure with a smaller size
end

;Call the spiral procedure with a starting size of 100
spiral 100
