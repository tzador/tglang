; This code snippet generates a fractal pattern using recursion
TO DRAWFRAC [DIST ANGLE ITER]
    ; Defines a procedure called DRAWFRAC with 3 parameters
    ; DIST is the distance between points, ANGLE is the angle at which the next point is drawn, ITER is the number of iterations

    IF ITER > 0 [
        ; Checks if the iteration count is greater than 0, if not the recursion terminates
        FORWARD DIST
        ; Moves turtle forward by DIST units
        RIGHT ANGLE
        ; Turns turtle right by ANGLE degrees
        DRAWFRAC [DIST ANGLE ITER - 1]
        ; Recursively calls DRAWFRAC with updated parameters
        LEFT ANGLE * 2
        ; Turns turtle left by twice the ANGLE degrees
        DRAWFRAC [DIST ANGLE ITER - 1]
        ; Recursively calls DRAWFRAC with updated parameters
        RIGHT ANGLE
        ; Turns turtle right by ANGLE degrees
        BACK DIST
        ; Moves turtle back by DIST units

PENDOWN; Sets the turtle to draw
DRAWFRAC [10 60 5]; Calls DRAWFRAC with initial parameters
PENUP; Lifts the turtle's pen
