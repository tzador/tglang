;; This is a LOGO code snippet that uses recursion to draw a Koch curve
;; Instructions: Load this code into a LOGO environment and type "Koch" to run it
to Koch :order :length :depth
  ;; Defines the procedure "Koch" with parameters for order (number of iterations), length of each line, and depth (maximum level of recursion)
  ifelse :order > 1 [
    ;; If the order is greater than 1, execute the following code
    repeat 3 [
      ;; Draws three Koch curves with 1/3 of the initial length
      Koch :order-1 :length/3 :depth-1
      rt 120
    ]
    ;; Draws the fourth Koch curve with the remaining 2/3 length and in the opposite direction
    Koch :order-1 :length*2/3 :depth-1
    lt 120
  ] [
    ;; Base case: Draws a straight line and stops recursion
    fd :length
  ]
end
Koch 5 256 5
;; Calls the "Koch" procedure with an order of 5, initial length of 256, and maximum depth of 5
