; This code snippet draws a star using a recursive procedure
; First, define the recursive procedure with two variables, "length" and "depth"
to star :length :depth
  if :depth > 0 [
    ; draw a line with given length
    fd :length
    ; rotate 144 degrees to the left
    lt 144
    ; recursively call the procedure with half the length and one less depth
    star :length / 2 :depth - 1
    ; rotate 144 degrees to the right
    rt 144
    ; move back the length of the first line
    bk :length
  ]
end

; set the starting position of the turtle
pu
setpos [-100 100]

; set the pen size
setps 3

; call the star procedure with a length of 200 and a depth of 5
star 200 5

; hide the turtle
