; This is a LOGO program that will create a square spiral

; The following command will set the screen size to 500 x 500 pixels
SETSCREENSIZE [500 500]

; The following commands will set the initial position of the turtle to the center of the screen and set its heading to 0 degrees (North)
SETHOME
SETHEADING 0

; The following command will create a variable called "side" and set its value to 10. This variable will be used to determine the size of each side of the spiral
MAKE "side 10

; The following loop will be repeated four times, creating four sides of the spiral
REPEAT 4 [

; The following commands will move the turtle forward by the value of "side" and then turn it right by 90 degrees
FORWARD :side
RIGHT 90

; The following command will increase the value of "side" by 5. This will create a gradual increase in size for each side of the spiral
MAKE "side :side + 5

]

; The following loop will be repeated six times, creating six smaller spirals within the larger spiral
REPEAT 6 [

; The following commands will move the turtle forward by the value of "side" and then turn it right by 90 degrees
FORWARD :side
RIGHT 90

; The following commands will decrease the value of "side" by 2. This will create a gradual decrease in size for each side of the smaller spirals
MAKE "side :side - 2

]

; This command will hide the turtle so it does not appear in the final drawing
HIDETURTLE

; This loop will be repeated 100 times, creating a total of 100 spirals in different sizes and positions
REPEAT 100 [

; The following commands will move the turtle forward by the value of "side" and then turn it right by 90 degrees
FORWARD :side
RIGHT 90

; The following command will increase the value of "side" by 1, creating a slight increase in size for each spiral
MAKE "side :side + 1

; The following command will change the color of the turtle to a random color, making each spiral unique
SETTC 1 + RANDOM 9

]

; This command will pause the program so the final drawing can be seen
PAUSE

; The following command will clear the drawing screen
