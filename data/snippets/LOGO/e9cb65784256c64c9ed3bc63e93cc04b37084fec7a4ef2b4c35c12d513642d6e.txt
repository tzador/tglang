; The following code uses the `FORWARD` and `RIGHT` commands to draw a complex pattern

; Start by defining the size of the pattern
MAKE "SIZE 100

; Set the size of the turtle to match the pattern size
SETTSIZE :SIZE

; Create a loop to draw the pattern multiple times
REPEAT 4 [
  ; Draw a line forward based on the size
  FORWARD :SIZE

  ; Turn the turtle right at a 90 degree angle
  RIGHT 90

  ; Start another loop to draw smaller lines within the larger line
  REPEAT 4 [
    ; Decrease the size of the line by half
    MAKE "SIZE :SIZE / 2

    ; Draw line forward using the new size
    FORWARD :SIZE

    ; Turn turtle right at a 90 degree angle
    RIGHT 90
  ]

  ; Turn turtle left at a 45 degree angle
  LEFT 45

  ; Start another loop to draw diagonal lines within the larger line
  REPEAT 2 [
    ; Draw line forward using the current size
    FORWARD :SIZE

    ; Turn turtle right at a 135 degree angle
    RIGHT 135
