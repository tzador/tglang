; This program draws a spiral pattern using recursive functions

; Function to draw a line segment
to draw [length]
  ; check if length is greater than 0
  ifelse length > 0 [
    ; move forward by length units
    fd length
    ; turn left by 90 degrees
    lt 90
    ; recursively call the function with length-1
    draw length-1
  ]   ; end if
  ; end of recursive function
end

; set initial length and starting position
set length 100
setxy 0 0

; set initial color and pen size
setpc "red
setpsize 2

; make turtle go faster
setturtle "fast

; recursive function call to draw spiral pattern
