;This is a program that draws a complex spiral pattern
;using the LOGO programming language

;Initialize the turtle and set its attributes
to initialize
  clearscreen
  hideturtle
  penup
  setpos 0 0
  setheading 0
  pendown
end

;Function for drawing a single arc
to drawArc :angle :radius :direction
  ;Raise the pen and move to the starting position
  penup
  setheading (:direction + 90)
  forward :radius
  setheading (:direction * -1)

  ;Lower the pen and draw the arc
  pendown
  arc :radius * 2 :angle
end

;Function for drawing a single quadrant of the spiral
to drawQuadrant :angle :radius :direction
  ;Draw four arcs with different radii and directions
  drawArc :angle :radius :direction
  drawArc :angle :radius * 2 :direction + 90
  drawArc :angle :radius * 3 :direction - 180
  drawArc :angle :radius * 4 :direction - 90
end

;Main function to draw the spiral pattern
to spiral
  ;Initialize the turtle and variables
  initialize
  make "angle 10
  make "radius 10
  make "direction 0

  ;Loop to draw multiple quadrants
  repeat 90 [
    drawQuadrant :angle :radius :direction
    ;Increase the angle and radius for the next quadrant
    make "angle :angle + 5
    make "radius :radius + 3
    make "direction :direction + 10
