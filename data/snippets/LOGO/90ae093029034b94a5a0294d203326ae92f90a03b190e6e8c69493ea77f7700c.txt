; This is a code snippet in LOGO
; It uses the repeat and make commands to generate a complex pattern

; First, set the speed of the turtle to a slow pace
Make "speed 1

; Define the length of each side of the shape
Make "side 50

; Start a repeat loop to generate the shape
Repeat 4 [

  ; Move the turtle forward by the length of one side
  Forward :side

  ; Turn the turtle to the right by 90 degrees
  Right 90

  ; Start a nested repeat loop to generate smaller shapes inside each side
  Repeat 6 [

    ; Move the turtle forward by half the length of the side
    Forward :side / 2

    ; Turn the turtle to the left by 60 degrees
    Left 60

    ; Move the turtle forward by half the length of the side
    Forward :side / 2

    ; Turn the turtle to the right by 60 degrees
    Right 60
  ]

  ; Move the turtle forward by the length of one side
  Forward :side

  ; Turn the turtle to the right by 90 degrees
  Right 90
