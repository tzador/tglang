to count :x ; defines a procedure called "count" with input variable "x"
if :x < 1 [ ; checks if the value of x is less than 1
  stop ; ends the procedure
]
print :x ; prints the current value of x
count :x - 1 ; calls the "count" procedure with the input variable "x" decreased by 1
end ; ends the procedure
;; This code snippet is a recursive procedure that counts down from a given input value to 1. It uses the "if" statement to check if the input value is less than 1 and stops the procedure if it is. Otherwise, it prints the current value of the input and calls the "count" procedure again with the input value decreased by 1. The process repeats until the input value reaches 1 and the procedure ends.
