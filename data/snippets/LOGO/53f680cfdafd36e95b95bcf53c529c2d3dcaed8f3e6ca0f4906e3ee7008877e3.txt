; This is a LOGO program that draws a spiral
; Define a procedure that takes in a starting angle, starting radius, and turn angle
to spiral :angle :radius :turn
  ; Create a loop that runs 360 / :turn times 
  repeat round 360 / :turn [
    ; Move forward by the current radius
    fd :radius
    ; Rotate by the current angle
    rt :angle
    ; Increment the angle by the turn angle
    set :angle :angle + :turn
    ; Decrement the radius by 1 to create a spiral effect
    set :radius :radius - 1 
  ]
end

; Call the spiral procedure and pass in the starting angle of 5, starting radius of 100, and turn angle of 10
