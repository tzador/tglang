; This code snippet draws a complex geometric figure using LOGO

; Define a procedure to draw a single side of the figure
TO SIDE :length
  FD :length        ; move forward by length units
  RT 90             ; turn right 90 degrees
  FD :length        ; move forward by length units
  RT 90             ; turn right 90 degrees
  FD :length        ; move forward by length units
  RT 90             ; turn right 90 degrees
  FD :length        ; move forward by length units
END

; Define a procedure to draw the entire figure
TO FIGURE
  REPEAT 10 [       ; repeat 10 times
    SIDE 50         ; draw a side of length 50 units
    RT 36           ; turn right 36 degrees (360 / 10)
