;; Define a procedure to draw a triangle
to triangle :size
  repeat 3 [fd :size lt 120]
end

;; Define a procedure to draw a 3D sphere by drawing triangles
to sphere :size
  make "base 12    ;; Number of triangles on base of sphere
  make "step :size / :base  ;; Distance turtle moves to draw triangles
  make "rotate 5   ;; Angle at which turtle rotates to create 3D illusion

  ;; Set turtle's heading to point towards center of sphere
  setheading 0

  ;; Set turtle's speed to fastest
  speed 0

  ;; Loop to draw triangles in a circle to create 3D sphere
  repeat :base [
    triangle :size         ;; Draw triangle with given size
    setheading :rotate     ;; Turn turtle towards next triangle
    fd :step               ;; Move turtle to edge of next triangle
    setheading 90          ;; Turn turtle to face center of sphere
