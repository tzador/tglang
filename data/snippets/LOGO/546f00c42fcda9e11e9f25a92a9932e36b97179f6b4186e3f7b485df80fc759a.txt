; This code snippet creates a fractal design using the LOGO programming language

TO FRACTAL :START :LENGTH :ANGLE :LEVEL
  ; The FRACTAL procedure takes in four inputs: the starting point, length of line segments, angle to turn, and level of recursion

  REPEAT 4 [ 
    FD :LENGTH
    RT :ANGLE
    FRACTAL :LENGTH/2 :ANGLE :LEVEL - 1
    LT :ANGLE
    FRACTAL :LENGTH/2 :ANGLE :LEVEL - 1
    RT :ANGLE
    BK :LENGTH ; Moves back to starting point
  ]
END

TO STAR :SIZE
  ; The STAR procedure takes in one input, the size of the star
  
  REPEAT 5 [ 
    FD :SIZE
    RT 144 ; 144 degrees creates a five-pointed star
  ]
END

TO MAIN
  ; The MAIN procedure is the main routine that calls the FRACTAL and STAR procedures to create the final design
  
  PU ; Pen up, does not draw lines
  HOME ; Moves turtle to center of screen
  SETPC [100 100 255] ; Sets pen color to blue
  SETPOS [-200 -200] ; Sets starting point for fractal
  PD ; Pen down, begins drawing
  FRACTAL 100 20 90 5 ; Calls FRACTAL procedure to create first layer of fractal
  PU ; Pen up, stops drawing
  SETPC [255 0 100] ; Sets pen color to pink
  SETPOS [100 100] ; Sets starting point for star
  STAR 50 ; Calls STAR procedure to create a star at the center
  PD ; Pen down, begins drawing
  HT ; Hides turtle, does not show it on screen
END

MAIN ; Calls MAIN routine to execute code
