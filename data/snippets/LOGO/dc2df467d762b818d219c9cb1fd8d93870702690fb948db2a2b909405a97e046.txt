;This code snippet creates a LOGO program that draws a spiral using the turtle graphics
;Define procedure to draw a spiral with 5 parameters representing the distance, angle, color, speed, and level of recursion.
to spiral :distance :angle :color :speed :level
  setheading :angle ;set the turtle's heading to the given angle
  setcolor :color ;set the pen color to the given color
  forward :distance ;move the turtle forward by the given distance
  if :level > 0 [ ;if there are more levels of recursion
    spiral :distance * 0.95 :angle + 1 :color * 1.1 :speed :level - 1 ;recursively call the procedure with updated parameters
  ]
end

;Set up the turtle graphics
to setup
  hideturtle ;hide the turtle from view
  pensize 3 ;set the pen size to 3
  speed 0 ;set the turtle's speed to maximum
end

;Call the setup procedure to initialize the turtle graphics
setup
;Call the spiral procedure with the initial parameters to draw the spiral
spiral 5 90 1 100 20
