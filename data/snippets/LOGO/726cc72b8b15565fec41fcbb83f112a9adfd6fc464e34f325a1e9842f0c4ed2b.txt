; This is a LOGO program that will draw a spiral shape
; Define the turtle and set its attributes
to setup
  clearscreen ; clear the screen to start fresh
  setpencolor 7 ; set the pen color to white
  setheading 90 ; set the heading to face up
  setxy 0 0 ; set the turtle's starting position at the center of the screen
end

; Define a procedure to draw the spiral
to spiral :size :angle :increment
  if :size > 0 [ ; base case: the size reaches 0
    forward :size ; move forward by the size
    right :angle ; turn right by the angle
    spiral :size - :increment :angle :increment ; recursively call `spiral` with smaller size
  ]
end

; Call the `setup` procedure to initialize the turtle

; Call the `spiral` procedure to draw a spiral with the given parameters
