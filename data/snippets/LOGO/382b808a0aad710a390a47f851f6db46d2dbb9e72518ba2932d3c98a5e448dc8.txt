;This code snippet generates a random fractal pattern
;using the circle and spiral commands in Logo language
;First, we define the number of circles in the pattern
make "numCircles 150

;Set a random starting point for the circles
setpos random 500
seth random 360

;Define the radius and speed of the circles
make "radius 5
make "speed 2

;Define the color for the circles to change to
make "color 0

;Start drawing the circles in a spiral pattern
repeat :numCircles [
  ;Draw a circle with the defined radius and color
  circle :radius
  setpencolor :color

  ;Increase the radius and speed for the next circle
  make "radius :radius + 3
  make "speed :speed + 1

  ;Move the turtle forward at the new speed and turn
  fd :speed
  lt 5

  ;Increase the color value for the next circle
  make "color :color + 1
]

;Add some additional randomness to the pattern
repeat :numCircles [
  ;Move the turtle to a random point on the canvas
  setpos random 500
  seth random 360

  ;Draw a spiral using the current radius and color
  spi :radius
  setpencolor :color

  ;Decrease the radius and increase the color for the next spiral
  make "radius :radius - 1
  make "color :color + 1
