; This is a complex code snippet in LOGO that creates a fractal tree

; Define procedure to draw a branch
to branch :size :angle
  forward :size
  right :angle
  forward :size
  right :angle
  forward :size
  right :angle
  forward :size
end

; Define procedure to draw the fractal tree
to fractal :size :angle :level
  if :level <= 0 [stop] ; stop if level is 0 or less
  branch :size :angle
  right :angle
  fractal :size / 1.2 :angle :level - 1 ; draw smaller branch on the right
  left :angle
  fractal :size / 1.2 :angle :level - 1 ; draw smaller branch on the left
  right :angle
  branch :size :angle
end

; Set the starting position and orientation

; Set the size and angle for the first level of the tree
make "size 100
make "angle 20

; Draw the first fractal tree
fractal :size :angle 5

; Set the size and angle for the second level of the tree
make "size 50
make "angle 25

; Draw the second fractal tree
fractal :size :angle 5

; Set the size and angle for the third level of the tree
make "size 25
make "angle 30

; Draw the third fractal tree
fractal :size :angle 5
