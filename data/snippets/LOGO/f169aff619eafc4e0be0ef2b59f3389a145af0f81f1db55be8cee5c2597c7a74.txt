; This program draws a spiral shape using recursive procedures

; Define the main procedure
to draw-spiral
  pu ; lift pen up
  setpos 100 100 ; set initial position
  pd ; put pen down
  spiral 1 ; call the recursive spiral procedure with initial size 1
end

; Define the recursive procedure to draw a spiral
to spiral :size
  if :size < 100 [
    fd :size * 2 ; move forward by twice the specified size
    rt 90 ; turn right by 90 degrees
    spiral :size + 1 ; recursively call spiral with increased size
  ]
end

draw-spiral ; call the main procedure to start drawing the spiral
