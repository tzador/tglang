; This code snippet draws a star using recursive procedures in LOGO

; Define recursive procedure to draw a line with given length
TO LINE :LENGTH
  IF :LENGTH > 0 [
    FD :LENGTH 
    RT 144 
    LINE :LENGTH - 1 ; recursive call
  ]
END

; Define recursive procedure to draw a star with given size
TO STAR :SIZE
  REPEAT 5 [
    LINE :SIZE
    LT 144
  ]
END

; Set starting coordinates and size for the star
SETXY 0 0
SET SIZE 100

; Call recursive procedure to draw a star
STAR SIZE
