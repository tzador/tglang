to draw-grid :size :grid-size
  ; This is a procedure for drawing a grid in LOGO programming language
  ; Takes in two arguments: 'size' for the grid size and 'grid-size' for the length of each grid square

  repeat :size
    ; Loops through 'size' number of times to draw the grid rows
    ; Starts by drawing the first row

    repeat :size
      ; Loops through 'size' number of times to create each grid square in the row

      fd :grid-size
      ; Moves the turtle forward by 'grid-size' pixels to create a square side

      rt 90
      ; Rotates the turtle 90 degrees to prepare for the next square

      fd :grid-size
      ; Moves the turtle forward by 'grid-size' pixels to close the square

      lt 180
      ; Rotates the turtle 180 degrees to prepare for the next square in the opposite direction

    penup
    ; Lifts the pen up to prevent drawing lines between rows
    ; Turtle is moved to the next row without drawing a line

    fd :grid-size
    ; Moves the turtle forward by 'grid-size' pixels to start the next row

    rt 90
    ; Rotates the turtle 90 degrees to prepare for the next row

    pendown
    ; Places the pen back down to start drawing the next row
end

; Example usage:
draw-grid 5 50
; This will create a 5x5 grid with each square being 50 pixels in length
