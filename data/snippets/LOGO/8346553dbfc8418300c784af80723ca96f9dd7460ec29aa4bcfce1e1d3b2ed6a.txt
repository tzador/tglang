; This code snippet creates a custom procedure that draws a spiral with varying colors and lengths

to spiral :size :color
  repeat 40 [
    fd :size
    rt 5
    setc :color
    setc round :color / 1.2 ; Decreases the color value by 1.2 to create a gradient effect
    setc round :color * 1.1 ; Increases the color value by 1.1 to create a gradient effect
    setc round :color / 1.1 ; Decreases the color value by 1.1 to create a gradient effect
    setc round :color * 1.2 ; Increases the color value by 1.2 to create a gradient effect
  ]
end

to start
  ; Define the colors used in spiral
  make "red 255
  make "green 0
  make "blue 0
  
  ; Define initial size and color
  make "size 10
  make "color (list :red :green :blue)
  
  ; Call the spiral procedure 4 times, passing in different sizes and colors each time
  spiral :size :color
  make "size :size * 1.2
  make "color (list :red :blue :green)
  spiral :size :color
  make "size :size * 1.2
  make "color (list :blue :green :red)
  spiral :size :color
  make "size :size * 1.2
  make "color (list :green :red :blue)
