; This code snippet is a LOGO program that draws a complex shape using turtle graphics
to shape
  ; Initializes the turtle's settings and pen color
  clearscreen ; clears the screen
  penup ; lifts the pen up to avoid drawing
  setxy 0 0 ; positions the turtle at the center of the screen
  setpensize 3 ; sets the pen thickness to 3
  setpencolor 0 255 0 ; sets the pen color to green

  ; Creates a for loop to draw the shape in a repeatable pattern
  repeat 10 [
    fd 100 ; moves the turtle forward 100 units
    rt 36 ; turns the turtle to the right by 36 degrees
    pd ; places the pen down to start drawing
    rt 90 ; turns the turtle to the right by 90 degrees
    fd 50 ; moves the turtle forward 50 units
    rt 90 ; turns the turtle to the right by 90 degrees
    rt 72 ; turns the turtle to the right by 72 degrees
    fd 100 ; moves the turtle forward 100 units
    rt 36 ; turns the turtle to the right by 36 degrees
    pu ; lifts the pen up to stop drawing

    ; Creates a nested for loop to draw smaller triangles within the larger triangle
    repeat 4 [
      fd 30 ; moves the turtle forward 30 units
      pd ; places the pen down to start drawing
      fd 15 ; moves the turtle forward 15 units
      rt 60 ; turns the turtle to the right by 60 degrees
