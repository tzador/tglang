; This code snippet creates a square made up of smaller triangles
; using recursion and the 'forward' and 'right' commands

;Function to draw a single triangle with side length 'size'
to triangle :size
  repeat 3 [
    forward :size
    right 120
  ]
end

;Function to draw a square made up of smaller triangles with side length 'size' and level of recursion 'lvl'
to square :size :lvl
  ; Base case when recursion level is 0
  if :lvl = 0 [stop]
  
  ; Recursively draw 4 triangles to form a square
  repeat 4 [
    triangle :size
    right 90
    square :size / 2 :lvl - 1
    right 90
  ]
end

;Call the square function with a side length of 200 and 5 levels of recursion
square 200 5
