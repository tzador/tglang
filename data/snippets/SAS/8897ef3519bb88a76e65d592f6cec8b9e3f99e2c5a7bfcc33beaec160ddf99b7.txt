/* This code snippet creates a macro that calculates the average
   salary for employees in each department of a company */

/* First, we define the macro and its input parameters */
%macro department_avg(dept);

/* Then, we create a data step to subset the data by the department name */
data &dept;
    set salary_data;
    where department="&dept.";
run;

/* Next, we use a PROC MEANS to calculate the average salary for the department */
proc means data=&dept noprint;
    var salary;
    output out=&dept._avg mean=salary_avg;
run;

/* Finally, we print the results in the log and end the macro */
%put "The average salary for department &dept. is &salary_avg.";
%mend;

/* To run the macro for each department, we use a loop */
/* We first create a macro variable with all the department names */
%let departments = Sales HR Finance;

/* Then, we use a %DO loop to iterate through each department */
%do i=1 %to &words(&departments.);
    /* We use the %scan function to retrieve each department name from the macro variable */
    %let dept = %scan(&departments., &i.);

    /* We call the department_avg macro for each department */
    %department_avg(&dept);
%end;

/* The log will display the average salary for each department */
/* For example: */
/* The average salary for department Sales is 50000.0. */
/* The average salary for department HR is 55000.0. */
/* The average salary for department Finance is 60000.0. */
