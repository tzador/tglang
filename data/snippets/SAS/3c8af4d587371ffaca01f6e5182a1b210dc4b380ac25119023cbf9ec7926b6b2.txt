/* This code snippet uses the SAS language to read and manipulate data from a dataset */

/* The first step is to create a data library and assign it to a specific location on your computer or server */
libname mylib '/home/user/mydatapath';

/* Next, we define and create the dataset we want to work with, using the data library we just created */
data mylib.mydata;
    input id $ var1 var2 var3;
    datalines;
    ABC 10 20 30
    DEF 15 25 35
    GHI 5 10 15
    ;
run;

/* Our dataset now contains 3 variables (var1-var3) and 3 observations (ABC, DEF, GHI) */

/* We can use the "proc means" procedure to calculate summary statistics for our variables */
proc means data=mylib.mydata;
    var var1 var2 var3;
run;

/* The output from this procedure will be a table showing mean, minimum, maximum, and other statistics for each variable */

/* In order to further manipulate our data, we can use the "proc sql" procedure to select and filter specific observations and variables */
proc sql noprint;
    /* Create a new dataset containing only observations where var1 is greater than 10 */
    create table mylib.var1_gt_10 as
    select * 
    from mylib.mydata

/* Now, we can use the "proc print" procedure to display our new dataset */
proc print data=mylib.var1_gt_10;
run;

/* The output will be a table showing only observations where var1 is greater than 10 */

/* Finally, we can export our data to a different file format (such as CSV or Excel) using the "proc export" procedure */
proc export data=mylib.var1_gt_10
