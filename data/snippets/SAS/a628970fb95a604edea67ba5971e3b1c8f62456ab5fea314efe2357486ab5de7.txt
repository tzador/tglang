/* This is an example of a complex SAS code. 
It calculates the average income of individuals by race, 
and creates a new variable indicating whether the individual's income exceeds the average. */

/* First, we import the data set containing information on individuals' race and income. */
data individuals;
    infile "&path/individuals.csv" dlm=","; /* Specify the path and delimiter for the data set */
    input id race $ income; /* Define variables for id, race, and income */
run;

/* Next, we use a proc means procedure to calculate the average income for each race group. */
proc means data=individuals nway noprint;
    class race; /* Specify the variable to group by */
    var income; /* Specify the variable to calculate the average for */
    output out=avg_income(drop=_:) mean=avg_inc; /* Create a new dataset with the average income for each race */
run;

/* Then, we merge the original data set with the average income data set. */
data individuals;
    merge individuals(in=in_ind) avg_income(in=in_avg); /* Merge the two data sets based on matching race values */
    by race;
    if in_ind; /* Keep only the observations from the original data set */
run;

/* Finally, we create a new variable indicating whether an individual's income exceeds the average for their race. */
data individuals;
    set individuals; /* Keep the merged data set */
    if income > avg_inc then above_avg = 1; /* Create a binary variable to indicate if the individual's income exceeds the average */
    else above_avg = 0; /* If not, set the variable to 0 */
