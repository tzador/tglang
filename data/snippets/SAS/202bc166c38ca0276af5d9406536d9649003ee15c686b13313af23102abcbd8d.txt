* This is a SAS code snippet that creates a macro variable containing a list of numerical values and uses it to create a table;
%let num_list = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10;
proc sql noprint;
    create table new_table as
    select *
        from old_table
        where num_var in (&num_list); *selects only rows with a numerical value in the list;
quit;
