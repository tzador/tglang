/***
This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the sum of values for each group in a dataset using PROC SUMMARY in SAS. 

***/

/***
* First, let's create a sample dataset with 3 variables: group, score, and weight. 
***/

data sample;
    input group $ score weight;
    datalines;
    A 85 10
    A 92 15
    B 78 12
    B 91 17
    C 86 11
    C 94 16
    C 80 14
    ;
run;

/***
* Next, we will use PROC SUMMARY to calculate the sum of scores and weights for each group.
***/

proc summary data = sample;
    class group;
    output out = summary sum = sum_score sum = sum_weight;
run;

/***
* Lastly, we will print out the results using PROC PRINT.
***/

proc print data = summary noobs;
    var group sum_score sum_weight;
run;
