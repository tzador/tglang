This code snippet uses the SAS language to generate a dataset with customer information and calculate their average purchase amount.
First, we create a dataset with customer names and their respective purchase amounts.

Next, we create a new variable to store the total purchase amount for each customer.
*/

We then calculate the total number of customers and total purchase amount for all customers.

Finally, we calculate the average purchase amount by dividing the total purchase amount by the total number of customers.
