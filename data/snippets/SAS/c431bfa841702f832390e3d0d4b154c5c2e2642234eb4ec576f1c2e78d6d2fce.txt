/* This code snippet generates a linear regression model for predicting
   the price of houses based on their size and number of bedrooms */

* Set up the libraries to be used;
libname mylib 'C:\data\housing';
libname proclib 'C:\program files\SAS\SAS 9.4\core\sasmacro';
options mlogic mprint symbolgen merror mwarning;

* Import the data into SAS and create a new dataset;
proc import out = housingdata datafile = 'C:\data\housingdata.csv'
    dbms = csv replace;
    getnames = yes;
    guessingrows = 1000;
run;

* Create a macro variable for the name of the outcome variable;
%let outcome = Price;

* Create a macro variable for the names of the predictor variables;
%let predictors = Size Bedrooms;

* Perform simple linear regression with the outcome variable and predictor variables;
proc reg data = housingdata;
    model &outcome = &predictors;
run;

* Evaluate the model's performance by printing the regression diagnostics;
proc reg data = housingdata;
    model &outcome = &predictors;
    output out = diagnostics p pvalue r vif;
run;
