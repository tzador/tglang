/* This is a complex code snippet in SAS */

/* First, we create a data set named 'cars' with three variables */
data cars;
  /* The 'set' statement reads in data from an existing data set */
  set oldcars;
  /* We filter the data to only include cars with a price of more than $20,000 */
  where price > 20000;
  /* We sort the data in descending order based on the 'model' variable */
  by descending model;
run;

/* Next, we create a macro named 'print_vars' that prints out the variable names of a given data set */
%macro print_vars(ds);
  /* The 'dictionary.columns' table contains information about the variables in a given data set */
  /* We use the 'dsn' option to specify the data set we want to retrieve information from */
  /* The 'into' clause stores the variable names in a macro variable named 'vars' for later use */
  proc sql noprint;
    select name
    into :vars separated by ' '
    from dictionary.columns
    where libname='WORK'
    and memname=upcase("&ds");
  quit;
  /* Finally, we use the 'put' statement to print out the variable names stored in the 'vars' macro variable */
  %put The variables in data set &ds are &vars;
%mend;

/* We then call the 'print_vars' macro on the 'cars' data set we created earlier */
%print_vars(cars); 

/* Output:
The variables in data set cars are MODEL YEAR PRICE */
