/*This code snippet uses the SAS DATA step to create a new data set
by merging two existing data sets based on a common variable*/

/*Create a dataset named 'new_dataset' by merging two existing datasets, 'dataset1' and 'dataset2', based on their common variable 'id'*/

data new_dataset;
    merge dataset1(in=a) dataset2(in=b);
    by id; *specifies the common variable to merge on;
    
    /*the IN= option creates indicator variables to keep track of which dataset the observation comes from*/
    
    /*the IF statement checks if the observation comes from dataset1 or dataset2, and applies specific logic accordingly*/
    if a;
    *logic for dataset1 observations;
    else if b;
    *logic for dataset2 observations;
    
    /*if no IF statement is used, SAS assumes the ELSE statement to apply to all observations*/
    
run;

/*The new_dataset will contain all the variables from both datasets, but the values will be from the dataset whose observation it came from*/
/*To combine variables with the same name from different datasets, use the syntax 'dataset_name.variable_name'*/

/*Some useful options that can be used in the MERGE statement are:*/

/*IN= option:
 -if the input dataset contains duplicates, the IN= option helps to identify the first and last observation for each unique value of the common variable*/
 
/*BY statement:
 -can use multiple variables to merge on, in case the common variable has the same value for multiple observations*/
 
/*DUPOUT= option:
 -creates a dataset containing duplicate observations based on the BY variables*/
 
/*KEY= option:
 -specifies which variables to include in the newly created dataset*/
 
/*OUT= option:
 -specifies the name of the new dataset*/
 
/*INSEP= option:
 -used for merging data from external files, specifies the separator used in the input dataset*/
 
/*FIRSTOBS=LASTOBS= options:
 -can be used to subset the observations to be merged*/
 
/*VERIFY option:
 -checks if the data from both datasets match before merging*/
 
/*Note: 
 -merge statement not only combines datasets horizontally, but also can be used to vertically stack datasets using the SET statement*/
