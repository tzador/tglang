/* Output: 
  The code snippet above shows how to manipulate data using the Data Step in SAS. First, a new dataset called "new_data" is created, which will contain the manipulated data. The SET statement is used to specify the existing dataset "old_data" that will be used as the source of data. Next, a WHERE statement is used to filter the data and only select observations where the age is greater than 25.

  Within the Data Step, a conditional statement is used using the IF-THEN-ELSE syntax. The first IF statement checks if the gender variable is equal to 'Male'. If it is, then a new variable called "new_variable" is created and its value is calculated by multiplying the existing variable "salary" by 1.1. The END statement indicates the end of this conditional block.

  Following the first IF statement is an ELSE IF statement, which checks if the gender variable is equal to 'Female'. If it is, then the value of "new_variable" is calculated by multiplying "salary" by 1.2. Another END statement marks the end of this block.

  Lastly, an ELSE statement is used to capture all other scenarios where the gender variable is neither 'Male' nor 'Female'. In this case, the value of "new_variable" is calculated by multiplying "salary" by 1.05. The RUN statement is used to execute the Data Step and generate the new dataset "new_data" with the manipulated data.

  This code snippet showcases the flexibility and power of the Data Step in SAS for data manipulation, allowing for conditional logic and creation of new variables based on existing ones.
