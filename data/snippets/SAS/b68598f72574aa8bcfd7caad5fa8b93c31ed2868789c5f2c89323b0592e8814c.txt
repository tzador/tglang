/* This code snippet uses a DATA step to filter data from a table and create a new variable */

/*First, create a new SAS dataset called "filtered_data" */

data filtered_data;  

    /* Use the SET statement to specify the input dataset "original_data" */
    set original_data;    

    /* Use the WHERE statement to filter the data based on specified criteria */
    where age >= 18 and gender = "Female";  

    /* Create a new variable "age_group" using the IF-THEN statement */
    if age < 30 then age_group = "Under 30";
    else if age < 50 then age_group = "30-49";
    else if age < 65 then age_group = "50-64";  
    else age_group = "65 and over";  

    /* Keep only the specified variables using the KEEP statement */
    keep customer_id age gender age_group;  

    /* Run the PROC PRINT procedure to display the filtered data */
    proc print data=filtered_data; 
run; 

/* Output:
Filtered dataset with customer_id, age, gender, and age_group
with only those individuals who are at least 18 years old and female. 
the age_group variable categorizes individuals into age groups.
