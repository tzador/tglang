/* Annotated SAS code snippet */
/*This code snippet will calculate the average salary of employees in a company*/

/*First, we will create a new variable 'avg_salary' to store the calculated average*/
data avg_salary;
    /*Use the set statement to read in the data from a pre-existing dataset 'employee'*/
    set employee;

    /*Next, we will use the mean function to calculate the average salary*/
    avg_salary = mean(salary);

    /*We will then use the output statement to print the results*/
    output;
run;

/*Lastly, we will use the proc print procedure to display the results*/
proc print data=avg_salary;
    /*Specify the variables to be displayed in the table*/
    var avg_salary;

    /*Use the title statement to label the table*/
    title 'Average Salary of Employees';

    /*We can also use the label statement to change the column header for the calculated average*/
    label avg_salary = 'Average Salary';

    /*Run the procedure and print the table*/
    run;
