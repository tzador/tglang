/* This is a code snippet in SAS */
/* This code snippet uses the 'INFILE' statement to read in a CSV file */
/* It then uses the 'INPUT' statement to format and store the data */
/* Finally, it prints out the formatted data using the 'PUT' statement */

/* Set up the INFILE statement to read the CSV file */
INFILE 'mydata.csv' DLM=',' DSD;

/* Define the variables to be read in and their respective formats */
INPUT ID $ 1-10 /* read in first 10 characters as a character variable */
      Gender $ 12 /* read in character at position 12 as 'Gender' variable */
      Age 13-14 /* read in characters from position 13 to 14 as numeric variable 'Age' */
      Height 16-18 /* read in characters from position 16 to 18 as numeric variable 'Height' */
      Weight 20-22 /* read in characters from position 20 to 22 as numeric variable 'Weight' */
      Race $ 24; /* read in character at position 24 as 'Race' variable */

/* Use PUT statement to print out formatted data from CSV file */
PUT 'ID: ' ID /
    'Gender: ' Gender /
    'Age: ' Age /
    'Height: ' Height /
    'Weight: ' Weight /
    'Race: ' Race;

/* Output:
