/* This is a SAS code snippet that uses proc SQL to query data from multiple tables */
/* First, we create a macro variable to store the list of tables we want to query */
%let tables = data1 data2 data3;
/* Next, we use proc SQL to create a temporary table called temp_data */
proc sql;
    create table temp_data as
    /* Here, we use a select statement to retrieve data from the tables listed in the macro variable */
    select a.*, b.*, c.*

    /* We use a common key to join the tables together */
    where a.common_key = b.common_key and b.common_key = c.common_key;

/* Now, we can use the temporary table to perform further analysis or manipulation */
/* For example, we can use a proc means procedure to calculate the average of a variable called 'value' */

/* The output of the proc means procedure will be the average value of the variable 'value' across all three tables */
