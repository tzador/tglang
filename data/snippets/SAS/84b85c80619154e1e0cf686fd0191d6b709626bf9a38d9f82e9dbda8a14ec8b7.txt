/*This is a long and complex code snippet in SAS.*/
/*It will create a new dataset called 'new_data' with transformed variables.*/
/*The first step is to merge two datasets, 'dataset1' and 'dataset2',
  based on the variable 'ID' using PROC SORT and a BY statement.*/
/*Then, the IF-THEN-ELSE statements are used to transform the variables 'Age' and 'Income'.
  If the value of 'Age' is less than 18, it is replaced with 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.
  If the value of 'Income' is missing or less than 0, it is replaced with the mean value of 'Income' in the dataset.*/
/*Lastly, the PROC PRINT statement is used to print the new dataset 'new_data'.
  The option OBS=10 restricts the output to only the first 10 observations.*/
