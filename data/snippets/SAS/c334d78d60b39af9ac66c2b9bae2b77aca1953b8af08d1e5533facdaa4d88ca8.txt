/* In this code snippet, we will be creating a dataset and performing some statistical analysis on it */

/*First, we will define the names and types of the variables in our dataset
  by using the 'input' statement and assigning the variables to their respective data types */

/*Next, we will import the data into our dataset by using the 'datalines' statement
  and inputting the values for each variable in the same order as defined above */

02 F 25 130 65 21.6 36

04 F 38 150 68 22.8 42
05 M 29 190 70 27.2 55

/*Now, we will use the 'proc means' procedure to calculate some summary statistics
  for each variable in our dataset */

/*Finally, we will use the 'proc ttest' procedure to perform a t-test on the
  'LabResults' variable to analyze the difference between male and female lab results */
