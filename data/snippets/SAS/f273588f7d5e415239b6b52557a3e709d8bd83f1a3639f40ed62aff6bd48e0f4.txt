/************************************************************************

The following code snippet calculates the total sales for each product
in a given dataset and creates a new dataset with the results.

************************************************************************/

/*Create a new dataset to store the aggregated results*/
data total_sales;

/*Set the initial value of total sales to 0*/
total_sales = 0;

/*Create a loop to iterate through each product in the dataset*/
do i = 1 to nobs;

  /*Use the SET statement to read in the data from the original dataset*/
  /*The POINT option specifies which observation to read in*/
  SET original_dataset point=i;

  /*Calculate the total sales for the current product*/
  /*This is done by summing up the sales for each month*/
  do j = 1 to 12;
    /*Use the SUM function to add the sales for each month*/
    /*The SALES variable is assumed to be present in the original dataset*/
    total_sales = sum(total_sales, sales{j});
  end;

  /*Output the results for the current product to the new dataset*/
  output;
end;

/*Sort the new dataset by product ID*/
proc sort data = total_sales;
  by product_id;
run;

/*View the results in the SAS log*/
proc print data = total_sales;
run;
