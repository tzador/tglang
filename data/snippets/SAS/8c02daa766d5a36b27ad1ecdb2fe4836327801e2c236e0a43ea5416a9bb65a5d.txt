/*This code snippet uses the Census data set to calculate the mean age of individuals based on their income level*/

/*First, we create a temporary data set with the desired variables from the Census data set*/
data temp;
	set census (keep=age income);
run;

/*Next, we filter the data to only include individuals with valid income values*/
data temp_filtered;
	set temp;
	where not missing(income);
run;

/*Then, we use PROC MEANS to calculate the mean age for each income level and store the results in a new data set*/
proc means data=temp_filtered noprint;
	var age;
	class income;
	output out=mean_age mean=;
run;

/*Finally, we print the results in the SAS log using PROC PRINT*/
proc print data=mean_age;
	title 'Mean Age by Income Level';
run;
