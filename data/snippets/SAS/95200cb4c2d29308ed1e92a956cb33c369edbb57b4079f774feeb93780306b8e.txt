/* This code snippet is used to calculate the average monthly sales for a retail store over a span of 12 months */

/* First, we define the data set that contains the monthly sales data for the store */
data monthly_sales;

    January 15000
    February 20000
    March 25000
    April 30000
    May 35000
    June 40000
    July 45000
    August 50000
    September 45000
    October 35000
    November 30000
    December 20000

/* The input statement specifies the variables and their data types in the data set */

/* Next, we use the proc means procedure to calculate the average of sales */
proc means data=monthly_sales mean;
    var sales; /* specifies the variable for which the mean is calculated */
    output out=avg_sales /* saves the results in a new data set */
    mean=average_sales; /* renames the mean variable */

/* Finally, we use the data step to print out the average sales for each month */

    put month= average_sales=;

/* The set statement specifies the data set to use */
/* The put statement prints the results for each month using the month and average_sales variables */
/* The final results will show the average sales for each month in the format "month=average_sales=" */
