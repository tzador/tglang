/* The following code uses the SAS DATA step to transpose a dataset */

/* First, we create a dataset with four variables: ID, Q1, Q2, and Q3 */

DATA survey;
    INPUT ID Q1 Q2 Q3;
    DATALINES;
    1 1 2 3
    2 4 5 6
    3 7 8 9
    ;

/* Next, we use the TRANSPOSE procedure to convert the dataset from a wide format to a long format */

PROC TRANSPOSE DATA = survey OUT = survey_long PREFIX = Q;
    BY ID;
    VAR Q1-Q3;
    ID VAR;
RUN;

/* The OUT= option specifies the name of the new transposed dataset, while the PREFIX= option adds a prefix to the variables in the new dataset */

/* The BY statement tells SAS to create a new observation for each value of the BY variable, in this case, ID */

/* The VAR statement specifies which variables to transpose, in this case, Q1, Q2, and Q3 */

/* The ID statement specifies the name of the new variable that will contain the names of the transposed variables, in this case, VAR */

/* The RUN statement ends the PROC TRANSPOSE step */

/* Finally, we can use PROC PRINT to display the transposed dataset */

PROC PRINT DATA = survey_long;
RUN;
