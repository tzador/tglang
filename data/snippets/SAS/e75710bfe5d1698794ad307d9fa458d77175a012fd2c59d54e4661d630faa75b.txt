/*This code snippet uses the SAS DATA step to merge two datasets based on a common variable, calculate a new variable, and then create a new dataset with the merged data.*/

/*Create a new dataset "combined_data" by merging the two datasets: "dataset1" and "dataset2"*/
data combined_data;
/*Use the MERGE statement to combine the two datasets based on the common variable "ID"*/
merge dataset1 dataset2;
/*Specify the common variable "ID" in parentheses and include any other variables needed in the OUTPUT statement*/
by ID;
/*Calculate a new variable "total" by summing the values of variables "var1" and "var2"*/
total = var1 + var2;
/*Use the KEEP statement to only keep the variable "total" in the new dataset*/
keep total;
run;

/*Print the first 10 observations of the new dataset "combined_data"*/
proc print data = combined_data (obs = 10);
run;

Output:
