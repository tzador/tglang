/***
* This is a complex code snippet in SAS that generates a report based on a dataset.
*
* First, we define our dataset with the INFILE statement and set its attributes.
* Then, we use the INPUT statement to specify the variables and their formats from the dataset.
***/
data report;
  infile "dataset.csv" dlm=","; /* Setting the input file and delimiter */
  length name $20.; /* Defining the character variable length */
  input id 1-3 age 4-5 name $; /* Specifying variables and their format */
  
/***
* Next, we use the WHERE statement to filter the data we want to include in our report.
* Then, we use the PROC FREQ procedure to calculate the frequency of values for each variable.
***/

  proc freq data=report; /* Running PROC FREQ procedure */

/***
* Finally, we use the PROC PRINT procedure to print the results of our report.
* We specify which dataset to print from and use the VAR statement to select specific variables.
