/* This is a SAS data step that creates a new dataset named 'new_dataset' from an existing dataset named 'old_dataset'.
  It first renames the variable 'age' to 'new_age', then creates a new variable named 'BMI' and assigns its value as weight/(height*height).
  Finally, a new variable named 'obese' is created with a value of 1 if BMI >= 30, or 0 if BMI < 30. */
