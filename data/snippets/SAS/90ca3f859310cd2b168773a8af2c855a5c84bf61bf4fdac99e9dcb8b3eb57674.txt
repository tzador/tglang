/* This is a complex example of an if/then statement in SAS */

/* We begin by creating two variables, x and y, and assigning them values */
x = 3;
y = 5;

/* Next, we use an if/then statement to check if x is less than y */
if (x < y) then do;
   /* If x is less than y, we print a message to the log and assign a new value to y */
   put "x is less than y";
   y = 10;
end;

/* If x is not less than y, we use an else statement to print a different message */
else do;
   put "x is greater than or equal to y";
end;

/* Finally, we print the values of x and y to the log to verify our changes */
put "x = " x;
put "y = " y;
