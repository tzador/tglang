/* 
This is a complex code snippet in SAS.

Here, we are creating a data set 'full_data' by merging two existing data sets 'data_set1' and 'data_set2'.
The two data sets are then sorted by the 'id' column in ascending order.
We then create a new variable 'combined' which is the sum of two existing variables 'col1' and 'col2'.
Finally, we print the first 10 observations of the merged and sorted data set.

/* First, we create the full_data data set by merging data_set1 and data_set2 */
data full_data;  
    merge data_set1 data_set2; /* Merge data sets using all common variables */
    by id; /* Sort by id column in ascending order */
    
    /* Then, we create a new variable 'combined' which is the sum of 'col1' and 'col2' */
    combined = col1 + col2; 

/* Finally, we print the first 10 observations of the merged and sorted data set */
proc print data=full_data (obs=10); /* Print only first 10 observations */
run; /* End of code */
