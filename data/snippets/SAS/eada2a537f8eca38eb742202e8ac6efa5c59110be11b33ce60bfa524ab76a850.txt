/* This is a code snippet in SAS that uses a PROC SORT statement to sort a dataset by multiple variables */

/* First, we define the dataset we want to sort */
data mydata;
    set dataset;

/* Next, we use the PROC SORT statement with the BY statement to specify the variables we want to sort by */
proc sort data=mydata;
    by var1 var2 var3;

/* Finally, we can use the OUT= option to create a new dataset with the sorted data */
    out=sorted_data; 
run;

/* Output: The dataset sorted_data will contain the sorted data from the original dataset, with the variables sorted in ascending order of var1, var2, and var3. */
