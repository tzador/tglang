/* This code snippet creates a macro variable that stores the average value of a variable called "income" from a data set called "population_data" */ 

/* first, sort the data set by the variable "income" in ascending order */
proc sort data=population_data out=sorted_data;
by income;
run;

/* next, calculate the total number of observations in the data set */
proc sql;
select count(*) into: total_obs
from population_data;
quit;

/* then, use the mean function to calculate the average value of "income" and store it in a macro variable called "avg_income" */
proc means data=sorted_data noprint;
var income;
output out=avg_income(keep=mean) mean=avg_income;
run;

/* finally, use the %sysfunc function to convert the macro variable into a formatted value with 2 decimal places, and store it in a new macro variable called "formatted_avg" */
%let formatted_avg = %sysfunc(putn(&avg_income, 9.2));

/* the macro variable "&formatted_avg" now contains the average value of "income" from the "population_data" data set */
