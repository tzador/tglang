/* This code snippet demonstrates how to create a complex data filter in SAS */

/* First, we define our filter criteria using the WHERE statement */
WHERE (condition1 AND condition2) OR (condition3 AND condition4);

/* Next, we use the IF-THEN statement to check for additional criteria */
IF condition5 OR condition6 THEN DO;
    /* code to perform action 1 */
    action1 = variable1;
    /* code to perform action 2 */
    action2 = variable2;
END;

/* We then use the KEEP statement to specify which variables to keep in the output dataset */
KEEP variable3 variable4;

/* Finally, we use the PROC SQL statement to create a table based on the filter and variable specifications */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE output AS
    SELECT variable3, variable4
    FROM input
    WHERE (condition1 AND condition2) OR (condition3 AND condition4)
    AND (condition5 OR condition6);
QUIT;

/* Output dataset "output" will contain only the specified variables and meet the specified filter criteria */
