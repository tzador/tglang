/**
This data step reads in a dataset and creates a new variable called "total" which is the sum of two other variables, "sales" and "cost".
The data set used is called "mydata" and it has two numeric variables with label "Sales" and "Cost".
The "retain" statement is used to keep a variable's value from the previous row and is used in this case to calculate a running total.
The "set" statement is used to read in the data and the "by" statement groups the data by the variable "category".
