/* This code snippet is for calculating the mean of a numeric variable in a data set */

/* First, we read in the data using the `DATA` statement */
data work.dataset;

/* Next, we define the variable we want to calculate the mean for */
set work.dataset;
var num_var;

/* Then, we use the `MEANS` procedure to calculate the mean */
proc means data = dataset mean;
/* `DATA` specifies the dataset we want to use and `MEAN` indicates we want to find the mean */
/* Additionally, we can use the `VAR` statement to specify which variable we want to find the mean for */
var num_var;

/* We can also add options to the `MEANS` procedure for specific calculations or outputs */
/* For example, the `NOPRINT` option will suppress the default output of the mean value */
proc means data = dataset mean noprint;
var num_var;

/* Finally, we use the `OUTPUT` statement to create a new data set with the mean value */
/* We can specify the name of the new dataset using the `OUT` option */
/* In this case, the mean value will be saved in a new variable named "Mean" */
proc means data = dataset mean out = mean_data;
var num_var;

/* To view the results, we can use the `PRINT` procedure */
/* This will print out the contents of the "mean_data" dataset we created with the mean value */
proc print data = mean_data;
run;

/* Output: */
