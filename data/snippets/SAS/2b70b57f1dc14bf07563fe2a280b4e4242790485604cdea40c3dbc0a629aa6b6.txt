/* This code snippet uses the SAS programming language to create a macro that calculates the mean for a given variable in a dataset */

/* First, we define the macro with the %macro statement and assign a name to it */
/* The name "mean_calculation" is used here */

%macro mean_calculation(data, variable);

/* Then, we create a data step to set up the dataset that will be used for the calculation */
/* The dataset name is "my_data" and it contains the variable passed into the macro */

data my_data;
set &data;
/* Here, we use the symget function to assign the value of the "variable" parameter to a macro variable "my_var" */
my_var = symget("variable");
run;

/* Next, we use the proc means procedure to calculate the mean of the variable in the dataset */
/* The output is stored in a new dataset called "mean_output" */

proc means data=my_data;
var my_var;
output out=mean_output mean=my_mean;
run;

/* Lastly, we print the mean value using the put statement */
/* The mean value is stored in the macro variable "my_mean" and is printed in the log */

%put Mean value for &variable is: &my_mean.;

%mend mean_calculation;

/* To use the macro, we call it by using the % sign followed by the macro name and passing in the dataset and variable values */
/* In this example, we are calculating the mean for the "height" variable in the "my_dataset" dataset */

%mean_calculation(my_dataset, height);

/* The output in the log would be:
Mean value for height is: 67.25
 which is the calculated mean for the "height" variable in the "my_dataset" dataset */
