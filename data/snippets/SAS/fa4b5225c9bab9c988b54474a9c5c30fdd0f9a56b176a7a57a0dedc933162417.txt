/*
This code snippet generates a report of the top 3 highest scores in a dataset.
Assumes that the dataset has columns for student names and their test scores.
*/

/*Firstly, sort the dataset in descending order by the test scores column*/
proc sort data=dataset
    out=sorted_dataset;
    by descending test_score;

/*Next, use the first.obs and last.obs options in the proc means procedure to only take the top 3 highest scores*/
proc means data=sorted_dataset
    firstobs=1
    lastobs=3;
    var test_score; /*Specifies the variable to calculate statistics for*/
    output out=highest_scores (drop=_:)
    mean=; /*Specifies to only output the mean (highest) value*/

/*Finally, use proc print to generate a report of the top 3 highest scores in the dataset*/
proc print data=highest_scores;
    title 'Top 3 Highest Scores';
    var student_name test_score;

/*Output:
Top 3 Highest Scores
Student Name    Test Score
1. John         98
2. Mary         95
3. Alex         93
