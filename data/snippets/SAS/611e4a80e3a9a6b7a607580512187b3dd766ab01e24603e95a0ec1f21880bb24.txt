*Create a macro to calculate the average and standard deviation of a dataset;
%macro calc_stats(ds);
    *Create a temporary dataset to store the calculated statistics;
    data tempds;
        *Calculate the mean of the dataset;
        mean = mean(&ds.);
        *Calculate the standard deviation of the dataset;
        std_dev = std(&ds.);
    run;

    *Print the results to the SAS log;
    %put The mean of the dataset is: &mean.;
    %put The standard deviation of the dataset is: &std_dev.;

    *Delete the temporary dataset;
    proc datasets library=work nolist;
