/* This is a program that calculates the mean and standard deviation of a given dataset */

/* first, we define the variables: */

;
/* then, we calculate the mean: */

OUTPUT OUT = mean_result MEAN = mean;
/* next, we calculate the standard deviation: */
DATA std_result;

/* finally, we print the results: */
