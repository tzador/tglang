/* Explanation: This code snippet uses the SAS programming language to generate a 
random sample of 100 observations from a dataset called sales_info using the 
PROC SURVEYSELECT procedure. It then performs a linear regression analysis on the 
sampled data using the PROC REG procedure. The seed is set in Step 1 for 
reproducibility and is used again in Step 2 to generate the same sample. The 
variables used in the regression model are sales, advertising, and price. The 
output of the regression analysis is displayed in the SAS output window. */
