/* This is a sample SAS program that calculates the average of three variables */

/* Define variables and set initial values */

%let var1 = 10;
%let var2 = 20;
%let var3 = 30;

/* Calculate the sum of the three variables */

%let sum = %eval(&var1 + &var2 + &var3);

/* Calculate the average and store it in a new variable */

%let avg = %eval(&sum / 3);

/* Print the result to the log */

%put The average of &var1, &var2, and &var3 is &avg.;

/* Output:
 * The average of 10, 20, and 30 is 20.
