/* This is a SAS code snippet that creates a macro program to count the number of observations in a data set */

/* First, we define the macro program called "count" */
%macro count(dataset);

/* We use PROC SQL to query the number of observations in the data set */
proc sql;
select count(*) into :obs_count
from &dataset.;
quit;

/* We use the macro function %put to print the count of observations */
%put Number of observations in dataset &dataset. is &obs_count.;

/* We end the macro program */
%mend count;

/* We call the macro program with the name of the data set we want to count the observations for */
%count(mydata);

/* Output:
Number of observations in dataset mydata is 100. */
