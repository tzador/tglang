/*This code snippet creates a macro subroutine that will generate a random sample of data from a given dataset*/

/*First, define the macro subroutine*/
%macro sample(dataset, size);
	/*Create a temporary dataset with a random number assigned to each observation*/
	data temp;
	set &dataset;
	seed = ranuni(1234); /*change seed to generate different samples*/
	run;
	
	/*Sort the temporary dataset in ascending order according to the random number assigned*/
	proc sort data=temp out=sorted_temp;
	by seed;
	run;
	
	/*Subset the sorted dataset to only include the desired sample size*/
	data sample;
	set sorted_temp (firstobs=1 obs=&size);
	run;
	
	/*Delete the temporary dataset*/
	proc delete data=temp;
	run;
	
	/*Pass the dataset containing the random sample back to the calling program*/
	%let &dataset = sample;
%mend;

/*Call the macro subroutine with the desired dataset and sample size*/
%sample(sales_data, 1000);

/*The sampled data will now be saved as a new dataset named 'sample' and can be used for further analysis*/
