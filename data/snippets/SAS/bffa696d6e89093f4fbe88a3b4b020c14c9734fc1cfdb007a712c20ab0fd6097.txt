/* This is a SAS code snippet for calculating the average age of a population */

* First, we declare the necessary variables;
data population;
    input name $ age;
    datalines;
    John 29
    Jane 32
    Michael 45
    Sarah 26
    ;
run;

* Next, we use a PROC MEANS step to calculate the average age;

proc means data=population mean;
    var age;
run;

* The output will display the average age in the SAS log;
