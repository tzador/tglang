/*This is a program that calculates the mean and standard deviation of a dataset*/
/*First, we declare our variables- a dataset named 'data1', a macro variable named 'mean', and two numeric macros 'n' and 's'*/
%let mean = ;
%let n = ;
%let s = ;

/*Next, we input our dataset and calculate the mean using the 'mean' function*/
data data1;
input x;
mean = mean(x); /*this assigns the mean value to the macro 'mean'*/
n = nobs(d1); /*this assigns the number of observations to the macro 'n'*/

/*Then, we use a 'do' loop to calculate the sum of squared deviations from the mean*/
do i = 1 to n;
    set data1 point = i; /*sets the pointer to the current observation*/
    s = s + (x-mean)**2; /*sums the squared deviations from the mean*/
end;

/*Now we calculate the standard deviation using the 'sqrt' function*/
s = sqrt(s/(n-1));

/*Finally, we output the results in the log and in a separate dataset named 'results'*/
put "The mean is " &mean.;
put "The standard deviation is " &s.;
run;

proc print data = results;
