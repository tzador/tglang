/* This code snippet is used to import a dataset called 'mydataset' 
   from a folder called 'myfolder' and store it in a SAS dataset 
   called 'imported_data'. */

/* First, we declare a libname which is a shortcut for the location 
   of our dataset. In this case, it is the 'myfolder' folder. */

/* Then, we create a data step that reads in the dataset 
   from the 'mydataset' file and stores it in a temporary work 
   dataset called 'temp_data'. */

	set mylib.mydataset;

/* Next, we use the proc append function to append the 'temp_data' 
   dataset to the existing 'imported_data' dataset. This will 
   combine the two datasets into one. */

/* Finally, we close the libname to release any associated resources 
   and delete the temp_data dataset since it is no longer needed for 
   our analysis. */
