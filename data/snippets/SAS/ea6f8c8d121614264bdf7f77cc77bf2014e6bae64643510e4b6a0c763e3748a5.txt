/* Create a macro variable and use it in a PROC SQL query */

%let myvar = "Product A";

proc sql;
    select sales

    where product = &myvar.; *calling the macro variable in the WHERE clause;
quit;

/* Output:
The SQL query will select the sales data from the sales_data table where the product name is equal to the value of the macro variable, "Product A". This allows for easier updates to the product name if it were to change in the future. */
