/**
* This code snippet uses the SAS 'proc sort' function to sort a dataset
* The 'data' statement specifies the input dataset, 'data_set', and the output dataset, 'sorted_data'
* The 'proc sort' function sorts the dataset according to the variables specified in the 'by' statement
* In this case, the data is first sorted by 'age' in descending order, followed by 'gender' in ascending order
* The 'run' statement executes the sorting process and the sorted dataset is saved in the output dataset, 'sorted_data'
