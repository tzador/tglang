/* The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a macro variable and use it in a data step */

%let var = '/path/to/my/file.csv'; /* create macro variable holding file path */

data new_dataset; /* create new SAS dataset */
	infile &var; /* use macro variable as input file path */
	input name $ age dob_mmddyy10.; /* define variables and their data types */
	format dob MMDDYY10.; /* define date format for dob variable */
run;  /* run data step to read in data from csv file */

/*
Explanation:
- In SAS, a macro variable is a placeholder for a value that can be reused throughout a program.
- %let statement is used to assign a value to a macro variable.
- The & symbol is used to reference the value of a macro variable within a statement.
- In this code snippet, the macro variable named 'var' is assigned the file path '/path/to/my/file.csv'.
- This file path is then used in the INFILE statement, which tells SAS where to read the data from.
- The INPUT statement defines the variables and their corresponding data types.
- The FORMAT statement defines the format of the variable 'dob' as month/day/year.
- Finally, the RUN statement executes the data step and creates a new SAS dataset called 'new_dataset'.
