/* This is a code snippet in SAS */
/* First, we declare a library called 'mydata' and assign the library to a permanent location */

/* Next, we create a new data set called 'patient_info' within the 'mydata' library */

/* We then use the 'if' statement to categorize patients as either underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on their BMI */
if bmi < 18.5 then category = 'Underweight';

/* Output:
The output of this code snippet will be a data set named 'patient_info' with four variables: patient_name, age, weight, and bmi. The bmi variable is calculated using the given formula and the category variable is added based on the BMI value. A summary of the data set will also be printed, displaying the average age, weight, and BMI for all patients. */
