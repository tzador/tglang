/* This is a SAS code snippet for data analysis */

* Create a SAS data set named 'mydata':
data mydata;
set indata;

* Sort the data by descending order of 'age':
proc sort data = mydata;
by descending age;

* Create a new variable called 'age_group' based on age values:
if age < 20 then age_group = 'under 20';
else if age < 30 then age_group = '20-29';
else if age < 40 then age_group = '30-39';
else if age < 50 then age_group = '40-49';
else if age < 60 then age_group = '50-59';
else if age < 70 then age_group = '60-69';
else age_group = 'over 70';

* Calculate mean and standard deviation of 'salary' for each 'age_group':
proc means data = mydata;
class age_group;
var salary;
output out = salary_stats mean = mean_salary std = std_deviation;

* Create a bar chart of mean salaries by age group:
title 'Mean Salary by Age Group';
proc sgplot data = salary_stats;
vbar age_group / response = mean_salary;
yaxis label = 'Mean Salary';
xaxis label = 'Age Group';

* Export the results to a CSV file:
proc export data = salary_stats outfile = 'salary_stats.csv' dbms = csv replace;
run;
