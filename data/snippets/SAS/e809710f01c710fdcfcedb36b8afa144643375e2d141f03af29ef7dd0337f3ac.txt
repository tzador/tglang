/* This code calculates the average of a variable in a dataset */

/**First, we create a temporary dataset containing only the variable we want to calculate the average for**/

	set original_dataset;

/**Next, we use the MEANS procedure to calculate the average of the variable in the temporary dataset**/

/**Finally, we print the average value calculated**/
