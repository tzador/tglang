/* This code snippet calculates the mean and standard deviation of a variable in a SAS dataset */

/* First, let's specify the SAS library and dataset we want to use */

LIBNAME mylib 'C:\Users\username\Documents\Sample_Data'; /* This creates a library named 'mylib' pointing to the location of our dataset */

DATA mylib.sample_data; /* This tells SAS that we want to use the dataset named 'sample_data' from the 'mylib' library */
    
/* Now, let's define the variable we want to analyze */
    
INPUT var1 var2 var3; /* This reads in the variables 'var1', 'var2', and 'var3' from our dataset */
    
/* Next, we use PROC MEANS to calculate the mean and standard deviation of 'var1' */

PROC MEANS DATA = mylib.sample_data; /* This tells SAS that we want to use the 'sample_data' dataset from the 'mylib' library for our analysis */
    
VAR var1; /* This specifies that we want to analyze the variable 'var1' */
    
OUTPUT OUT = summary_stats MEAN = mean_var1 STD = std_var1; /* This creates a new dataset named 'summary_stats' containing the mean and standard deviation of 'var1' */
    
RUN; /* This tells SAS to run the PROC MEANS procedure and output the results to our specified dataset */
    
/* Lastly, we can print the mean and standard deviation of 'var1' for observation purposes */

PROC PRINT DATA = summary_stats; /* This tells SAS that we want to print the data in our 'summary_stats' dataset */
    
VAR mean_var1 std_var1; /* This specifies that we only want to print the variables 'mean_var1' and 'std_var1' */
    
TITLE 'Summary Statistics for var1'; /* This creates a title for our output */
    
RUN; /* This tells SAS to run the PROC PRINT procedure and output the results to our screen */
