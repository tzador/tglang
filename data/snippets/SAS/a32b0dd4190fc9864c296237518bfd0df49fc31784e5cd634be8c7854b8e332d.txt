/* This is a program to calculate the average of a list of numbers */

/* First, we initialize the list and the variables we will use */
data numbers; /* create a new temporary dataset named 'numbers' */
input num; /* input a new variable named 'num' */
cards; /* enter the numbers in the dataset */

; /* end of input statement */

/* Next, we use a 'PROC MEANS' procedure to calculate the average of the dataset */
proc means data=numbers mean; /* specify the dataset and ask for the mean */
var num; /* specify the variable for which mean will be calculated */
output out=avg_mean mean=num_avg; /* create a new dataset named 'avg_mean' and output the calculated mean to a variable named 'num_avg' */
run; /* run the procedure */

/* Lastly, we print the calculated average in the log and in the output window */
data _null_; /* create a new temporary dataset */
set avg_mean; /* specify the dataset to be used */
file print; /* send the following statements to the log and output window */
put "The average of the list of numbers is " num_avg; /* print the calculated mean in the log and output window */
run; /* run the data step */

/* The output will appear as follows:
The average of the list of numbers is 3
