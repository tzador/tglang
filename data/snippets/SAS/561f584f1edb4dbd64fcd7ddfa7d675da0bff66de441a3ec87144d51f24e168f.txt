/* ANOVA tests for comparing means across different groups */
/* First, read in the data set */
proc import datafile="C:\users\datasets\diabetes.csv" out=diabetes dbms=csv replace;
getnames=yes;
run;

/* Then, perform ANOVA using PROC GLM */
proc glm data=diabetes;
class group; /* specify the grouping variable */
model glucose = group; /* specify the dependent and independent variables */
means group; /* request means output for each group */
run;

/* Finally, interpret the ANOVA results */
/* Look for a significant F value under the Type III Tests of Fixed Effects */
/* If significant, check the means output to see which groups differ from each other */
/* Use the Least Square Means (LSMEANS) column to compare group means */
