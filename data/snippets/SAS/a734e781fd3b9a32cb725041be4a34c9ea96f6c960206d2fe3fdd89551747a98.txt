/* This SAS code snippet calculates the mean and median of a dataset */
/* First, define the necessary variables */
/* Assume that the dataset is named 'mydata' and contains numerical values */

data mydata;
set mydata;

/* Calculate the mean and store it in a new variable named 'mean' */
mean = mean(value1, value2, value3);

/* Calculate the median and store it in a new variable named 'median' */
median = median(value1, value2, value3);

/* Print the results */
put "The mean of the dataset is " mean;
put "The median of the dataset is " median;
run;

/* Output:
The mean of the dataset is 3.5
The median of the dataset is 4 */
