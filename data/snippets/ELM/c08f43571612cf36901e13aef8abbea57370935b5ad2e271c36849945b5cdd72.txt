-- Define a user-defined type called 'Shape'
type Shape
    = Rectangle Float Float -- Represents a rectangle with width and height
    | Circle Float -- Represents a circle with radius

-- Define a function called 'area' that takes in a Shape and returns a Float 
area : Shape -> Float 
area shape = 
    case shape of 
        Rectangle width height -> width * height -- Calculate area of rectangle
        Circle radius -> 3.14 * (radius * radius) -- Calculate area of circle

-- Define a function called 'perimeter' that takes in a Shape and returns a Float
perimeter : Shape -> Float
perimeter shape = 
    case shape of 
        Rectangle width height -> 2 * (width + height) -- Calculate perimeter of rectangle
        Circle radius -> (2 * 3.14) * radius -- Calculate circumference of circle
