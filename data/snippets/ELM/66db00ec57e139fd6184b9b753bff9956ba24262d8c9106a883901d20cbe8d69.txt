-- a simple function that takes in two Points and calculates the distance between them
calculateDistance : Point -> Point -> Float
calculateDistance point1 point2 =
    let
        deltaX = point2.x - point1.x -- find the difference in x values
        deltaY = point2.y - point1.y -- find the difference in y values
    in
    sqrt (deltaX^2 + deltaY^2) -- use Pythagorean theorem to find the distance
