-- The following code defines a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
module Factorial exposing (..)

-- Factorial function with type signature
factorial : Int -> Int
factorial n =
    -- Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    if n == 0 then
        1
    -- Recursive case: calculate factorial of n-1 and multiply it with n
    else
        n * factorial (n - 1)

-- Example call to factorial function with input 5
factorial 5 -- Output: 120
