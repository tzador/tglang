-- This code snippet is an example of a function in ELM that takes in a list of integers and outputs the sum of the even numbers in the list

sumEven : List Int -> Int
-- ^ function that takes in a list of integers and outputs an integer

sumEven list =
    List.foldl
        (\x acc ->
            if x % 2 == 0 then
                acc + x
            else
                acc
        )
        0
        list
-- ^ performing a fold (left to right) on the list, with an initial accumulator of 0 and using an anonymous function that checks if the current element is even. If it is, the element is added to the accumulator, otherwise, the accumulator remains the same. The final result is the sum of all the even numbers in the list.
