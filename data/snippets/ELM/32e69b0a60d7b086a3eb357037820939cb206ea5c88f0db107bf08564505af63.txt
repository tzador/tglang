-- This is a function that takes in a list of words and returns a list of their lengths
lengthWords : List String -> List Int

-- First, we define a helper function that takes in a string and computes its length
lengthWord : String -> Int
lengthWord word = String.length word

-- We then use the built-in map function to apply our helper function to each element in the list
-- and store the resulting list in a variable called "lengths"
lengths = List.map lengthWord words

-- Finally, we return the list of lengths as our output
in
lengths
