-- This code snippet is an example of a function that finds the total sum of a list of numbers.

-- Function signature that takes in a list of numbers and returns an integer.
intSum : List Int -> Int
intSum numbers =
    -- Pattern matching to recursively add each number in the list to the total sum.
    case numbers of
        [] -> 0 -- Base case: if the list is empty, return 0.
        (x :: xs) -> x + intSum xs -- Recursive case: add the first number in the list to the sum of the rest of the numbers.

-- Example usage with a list of numbers.
intSum [1, 2, 3, 4] -- Output: 10
