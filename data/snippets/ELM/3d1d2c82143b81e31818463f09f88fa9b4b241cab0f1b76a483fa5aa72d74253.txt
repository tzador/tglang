-- This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
factorial : Int -> Int
factorial n =
  case n of
    0 -> 1
    _ -> n * factorial (n - 1)
 
-- This is a list of numbers
numbers : List Int
numbers =
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 
-- This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list with the factorial of each number
factorialList : List Int -> List Int

-- This is the final result, where we apply the factorialList function to the numbers list
