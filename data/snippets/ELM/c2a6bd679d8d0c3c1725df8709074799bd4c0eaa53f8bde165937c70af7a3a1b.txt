module Main exposing (main)

import Html exposing (text)
import Html.Attributes exposing (style)

-- This is a short example module in ELM that uses Html and Html.Attributes libraries. 
-- It displays a simple text on the screen with some styling applied to it.

main = 
    Html.text "Hello World" 
        |> Html.Attributes.style 
        [("font-size", "30px"), ("color", "blue")]
        
-- In the main function, we use the Html.text function to create an Html node with the text "Hello World" as its content.
-- Then, we pipe that node into the Html.Attributes.style function, which takes in a list of style attributes as its argument.
-- Here, we use a list of two tuples, with the first element being the attribute name and the second element being the value.
-- Finally, we pass this list as the second argument to the style function, which adds the specified styling to the Html node.
-- The resulting Html node is then returned and displayed on the screen.
-- Note: This is just a simple example and there are many more complex ways to style Html nodes in ELM.
