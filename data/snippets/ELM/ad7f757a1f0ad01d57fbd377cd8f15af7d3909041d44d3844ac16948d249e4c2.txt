-- This code defines a function called 'factorial' that takes in
-- an integer 'num' and calculates its factorial
factorial : Int -> Int
factorial num =
  if num == 0 then -- Base case: if input number is 0, factorial is 1
    1
  else
    num * factorial (num - 1) -- Recursive case: calculating factorial
