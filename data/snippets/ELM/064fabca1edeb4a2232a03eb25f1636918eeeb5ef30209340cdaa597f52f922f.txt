-- Function to reverse a list.
reverse : List a -> List a
reverse list =
    List.foldl (\x acc -> x :: acc) [] list

{- This is a higher-order function, or a function that takes another function as an argument, used for iterating through the elements of the list and building a new list in reverse order using the accumulator. The first argument (here referred to as x) is the current element in the list, and the second argument (represented by acc) is the accumulator which holds the partially-reversed list as we iterate through the list. The third argument is the initial value of the accumulator, an empty list. By using List.foldl, we are able to apply the function to each element of the list and build the new list in reverse order. -}
