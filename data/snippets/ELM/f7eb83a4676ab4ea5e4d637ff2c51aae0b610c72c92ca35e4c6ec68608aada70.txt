-- This code snippet creates a function that takes in a list of strings and returns a new list with all the strings capitalized.

-- Define the function named "capitalizeList" and give it a type declaration.
capitalizeList : List String -> List String

-- Use pattern matching to handle three cases: empty list, singleton list, and list with multiple elements.
capitalizeList list =
    case list of
        [] ->
            []

        [x] ->
            [String.toUpper x]

        x :: xs ->
            String.toUpper x :: capitalizeList xs

-- Example use case: print out the capitalized version of a list of names.
main =
    capitalizeList ["anna", "benjamin", "clara", "daniel"]

-- Output:
-- ["ANNA", "BENJAMIN", "CLARA", "DANIEL"]
