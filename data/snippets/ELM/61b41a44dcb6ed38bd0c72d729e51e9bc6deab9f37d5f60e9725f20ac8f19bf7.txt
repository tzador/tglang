-- This function takes in a list of integers and returns their sum
sumList : List Int -> Int
sumList list =
    case list of
        [] ->
            0

        x :: xs ->
            x + sumList xs

-- This defines a list of integers
myList : List Int
myList =
    [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]

-- This outputs the sum of myList
sumList myList
-- Output: 15
