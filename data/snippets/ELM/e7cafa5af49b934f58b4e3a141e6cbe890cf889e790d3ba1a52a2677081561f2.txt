-- This is a complex snippet that demonstrates converting a list of strings
-- into a single string with a delimiter

import String

-- Our list of strings
strings = ["Hello", "World", "This", "Is", "A", "Test"]

-- Our delimiter
delimiter = " "

-- Function to recursively concatenate strings with delimiter
concatStrings : List String -> String -> String
concatStrings list acc =
    case list of
        [] ->
            acc
        
        [x] ->
            String.append acc x
        
        x :: xs ->
            concatStrings xs (String.append (String.append acc delimiter) x)
        
-- Call the function with our list of strings and empty string as accumulator
finalString = concatStrings strings ""

-- Print the final string
main =
    Debug.log finalString
