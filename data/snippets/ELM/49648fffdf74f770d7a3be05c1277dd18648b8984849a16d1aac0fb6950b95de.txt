-- This function takes in a list of integers and returns a list of their squared values
squaredList : List Int -> List Int
squaredList list =
  List.map (\x -> x * x) list
-- map applies a function to each element in the list and returns a new list with the results

myList : List Int
myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

-- Call the squaredList function on the myList
squaredList myList
-- Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
