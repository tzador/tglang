-- This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

-- Defining the function.
factorial : Int -> Int
factorial n =
  if n < 0 then
    0 -- If the input is a negative number, return 0 as the factorial is undefined for negative numbers.
  else if n == 0 then
    1 -- If the input is 0, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1.
  else
    n * factorial (n - 1) -- Recursive call to the factorial function with n-1 as the input.

-- Call the factorial function.
factorial 5 -- Returns 120, the factorial of 5.
