-- This module is exposing the main function that is responsible for rendering the HTML code and displaying it on the webpage.
-- We are importing the Html module which allows us to create HTML elements such as `div`, `br`, and `hr`.
-- The `div` function is used to create a container for other HTML elements.
-- The first argument for the `div` function is a list of attributes for the `div` element.
-- In this case, we have an empty list `[]` as we do not have any attributes for the element.
-- The second argument is a list of child elements that will be contained within the `div`.
-- In our case, we have three `text` elements that contain the text "Hello, World!", "This is a code snippet in ELM.", and "It is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript." respectively.
-- In between each `text` element, we have used other HTML elements such as `br` (line break) and `hr` (horizontal rule) for formatting purposes.
-- Finally, we close the `div` function and end the main function.
