{- This is a custom type called `Exercise` with two fields: `name` and `sets`.
The `name` field is of type `String` and the `sets` field is a list of type `Set`.
This type will represent an exercise with its name and a list of sets. -}

{- This is a custom type called `Set` with three fields: `setNumber`, `reps`, and `weight`.
The `setNumber` field is of type `Int`, the `reps` field is also of type `Int`,
and the `weight` field is of type `Float`.
This type will represent a set within an exercise, with its set number, number of reps, and weight lifted. -}

calculateTotalReps : Exercise -> Int
calculateTotalReps exercise =

{- This function takes in an `Exercise` and calculates the total number of reps for that exercise.
It does this by using the `List.foldl` function, which iterates through the list of sets,
and adds the number of reps in each set to a total value. -}

{- This is a list of `Exercise` data, representing a workout with two exercises: Bench Press and Deadlift.
Each exercise has a `name` and a list of sets with their set number, reps, and weight.
This list can be used to calculate total reps for a workout or display exercise data.

totalReps : List Int
totalReps =
    List.map calculateTotalReps exercises

{- This is a list of `Int` values, representing the total number of reps for each exercise in the workout.
This is achieved by using the `List.map` function, which applies the `calculateTotalReps` function to each `Exercise` in the `exercises` list.
The resulting list would be [24, 15], representing the total reps for Bench Press and Deadlift in this workout.
