{-| Function that takes in two integer lists and returns the
intersection of the two lists.

Examples:
intersection [1,2,3,4] [3,4,5,6] == [3,4]
intersection [1,1,2,3,5,8] [2,3,3,4,5,7] == [2,3,5]
intersection [] [] == []

intersection : List Int -> List Int -> List Int
intersection xs ys =
  let
    shared = List.filter (\x -> List.member x ys) xs
    unique = List.filter (\x -> List.member x shared) xs
  in
    unique
