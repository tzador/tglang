--| A custom type called `Shape` with two constructors `Circle` and `Rectangle`
type Shape
    = Circle Float Float Float

--| Function to calculate the area of a given `Shape`
areaOfShape : Shape -> Float

    case shape of
        Circle _ _ radius ->
            3.14 * radius * radius

            width * height

--| Main function to combine two shapes and calculate the total area
