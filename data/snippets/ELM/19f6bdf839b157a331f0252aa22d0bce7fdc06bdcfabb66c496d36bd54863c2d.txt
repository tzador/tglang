# Explanation:

This code snippet is written in ELM, a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It creates a custom data type called 'Person', which has four attributes: name, age, height, and interests. The data type is linked with a list of values, called 'people', which stores three Person objects. Each object has different attributes assigned to it. 

Type aliases in ELM are used to declare custom data types that can be used throughout the program. In this case, the Person type has four attributes, each with its own data type. Strings are used for the name and interests attributes, while Int is used for the age and Float for the height. 

The 'people' variable is a list of Person objects. The data within the square brackets is the actual data that is stored in this list. Each Person object is created using curly brackets and filled with values for its attributes. The values are separated by commas. Notice that the values for the 'interests' attribute are also a list of strings, with each interest separated by a comma.

This code snippet is a simple example of how data can be stored in custom data types and how lists can be used to store multiple objects of the same type.
