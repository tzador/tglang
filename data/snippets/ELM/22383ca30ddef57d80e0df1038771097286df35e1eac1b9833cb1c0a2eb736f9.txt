module Main exposing (..)

import Html exposing (text)

main : Html msg
main =
    text "Hello, World!"

-- This is a basic "Hello, World!" program in ELM. 
-- The module declaration exposes all functions in the module.
-- The import statement brings in the Html module, which allows us to create HTML elements.
-- The main function returns a "text" element with the string "Hello, World!" as its content.
-- The type annotation indicates that the main function returns an Html element with a generic message type.
-- This ensures that the function can be used in any context, even if the message type is not yet defined.
-- In ELM, the type system is strict, which means all functions must have explicit type annotations.
-- This promotes readability and helps avoid errors. 
-- Finally, the code is wrapped in a triple backtick for markdown formatting.
