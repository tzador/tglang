-- The code above was defining a custom type called 'Type' in ELM programming language.
-- This type has 4 variants, each with different format.
-- The first variant 'One' is just a plain type with no data.
-- The second variant 'Two' has an associated integer value.
-- The third variant 'Three' has two associated values, one float and one string.
-- Finally, the fourth variant 'Four' has associated values in the form of a record with three fields, name, age, and isStudent, each with a specific data type.
