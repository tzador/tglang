-- This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list

sumEven : List number -> number
sumEven nums =
    let
        sum = List.foldl (\num total -> if num % 2 == 0 then total + num else total) 0 nums
        -- The foldl function is used to loop through the list and apply the given function to each element, starting from a given initial value (0 in this case)
        -- In the function, '\num total' represents the current element and the total sum so far
        -- The if statement checks if the current element is even (num % 2 == 0) and if so, adds it to the total sum
    in
        sum
        -- The final sum is returned as the result of the function
