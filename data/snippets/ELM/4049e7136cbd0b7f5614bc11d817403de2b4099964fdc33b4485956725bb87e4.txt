-- This code snippet is used to create a function named "fibonacci" that takes in an integer and returns the nth term of the fibonacci sequence.

-- This function uses pattern matching and recursion to calculate the fibonacci sequence.
fibonacci : Int -> Int
fibonacci n =
  case n of
    0 -> 0
    1 -> 1
    _ -> fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)

-- An example of calling the function and assigning the returned value to a variable "result".
result : Int
result = fibonacci 6

-- This line prints the output to the console.
-- Output: 8
