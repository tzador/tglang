-- This code snippet is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of the squares of all the even numbers in the list.

-- Function declaration with the parameter of a list of integers
sumEvenSquares : List Int -> Int
-- Base case when the list is empty, return 0
sumEvenSquares [] = 0
-- Pattern matching to check if the first element in the list is even
sumEvenSquares (x::xs) = if (mod x 2 == 0) then
                            -- Square the even number and add it to the recursive call with the rest of the list
                            x * x + sumEvenSquares xs
                         else
                            -- Skip the odd number and just return the recursive call with the rest of the list
                            sumEvenSquares xs
