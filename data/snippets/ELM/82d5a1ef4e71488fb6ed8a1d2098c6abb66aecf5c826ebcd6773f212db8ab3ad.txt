-- This code is an example of a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number
-- The function takes in a parameter n and returns the factorial of n
factorial : Int -> Int
factorial n =
    if n <= 1 then
        1
    else
        n * factorial (n-1)

-- This function calculates the sum of all the elements in a list 
-- The function takes in a list of integers and returns the sum
sum : List Int -> Int
sum list =
    case list of
        [] ->
            0
        
        x :: xs ->
            x + sum xs
