-- This code snippet shows an advanced function that generates a list based on some given conditions
-- It takes in a list of numbers, filters out any numbers less than 10, multiplies each remaining number by 2, and then sorts the list in descending order

getNewList : List Int -> List Int
getNewList numbers =
    let
        biggerThanTen = List.filter (\number -> number > 10) numbers
        multipliedByTwo = List.map (\number -> number * 2) biggerThanTen
    in
        List.sort (\number1 number2 -> if number1 > number2 then -1 else 1) multipliedByTwo
