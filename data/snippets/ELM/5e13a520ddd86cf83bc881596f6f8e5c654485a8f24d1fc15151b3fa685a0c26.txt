--| This is a function that takes in two lists and returns a new list containing the elements that are common between the two lists.

commonElements : List a -> List a -> List a
commonElements list1 list2 =
    let
        set1 = Set.fromList list1
        set2 = Set.fromList list2
    in
        Set.toList (Set.intersect set1 set2)
-- The function takes in two lists and uses the Set.fromList function to convert them into sets, which removes any duplicates from the lists. The Set.intersect function is then used to find the common elements between the two sets, and finally the Set.toList function is used to convert the resulting set back into a list.
