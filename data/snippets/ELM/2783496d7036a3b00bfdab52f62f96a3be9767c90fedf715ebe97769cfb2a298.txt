-- This is a program that generates a random list of numbers and checks if each number is divisible by 3
import Random

-- Generate a list of 10 random integers between 1 and 100

randomList =
    Random.int 1 100

        |> Random.generate

-- A function that checks if a number is divisible by 3
isDivisibleByThree : Int -> Bool

-- Filter the random list to only contain numbers that are divisible by 3

-- Print the original random list
print "Original Random List: "

-- Print the filtered list
