-- This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given integer
-- and returns the result as an integer

factorial : Int -> Int
factorial n =
  if n < 0 then
    error "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers"
  else
    List.foldl (*) 1 (List.range 1 n)
    -- uses List.foldl to apply the multiplication function to all elements in the list
    -- starting from 1 and ending at n
    -- initial value is 1
    -- result is the factorial of n

main : Int
main =
  let
    num = 5
    -- sets the value of the integer to find the factorial of
  in
    factorial num
    -- calls the factorial function on the input integer and returns the result as an integer
