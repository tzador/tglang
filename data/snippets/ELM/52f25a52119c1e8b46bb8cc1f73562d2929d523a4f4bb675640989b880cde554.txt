-- This code snippet shows a recursive function in ELM to find the factorial of a given number

-- Calculate the factorial of a given number
factorial : Int -> Int
factorial n =
  if n < 0 then
    -1
  else if n < 2 then
    1
  else
    n * factorial (n - 1) -- Uses recursion to calculate the factorial of n
