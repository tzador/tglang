-- This code snippet is an example of a recursive function in ELM that calculates the factorial of a given number --
factorial : Int -> Int -- Takes an integer as input and outputs an integer
factorial n =
  if n < 0 then
    throw (Exception "Factorial of a negative number does not exist") -- Throw an exception if the input is negative
  else if n == 1 then
    1 -- Base case, factorial of 1 is 1
  else
    n * factorial (n - 1) -- Recursive call to calculate factorial of n-1 and multiply it with n
