-- This is a function that returns a list of tuples containing the sum and difference of two given numbers.
addSumAndDiff : Int -> Int -> [(Int, Int)]
addSumAndDiff x y =
    [ (x + y, x - y) ]
-- The function takes in two integer parameters and returns a list of tuples.
-- The tuples contain the sum and difference of the two numbers.
-- For example if x = 5 and y = 3, the output would be [(8, 2)].
