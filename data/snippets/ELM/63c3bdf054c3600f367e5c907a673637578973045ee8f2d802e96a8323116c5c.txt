{-| This function calculates the binomial coefficient of n and k using a recursive algorithm.

It takes in two integers, n and k, and returns an integer representing the binomial coefficient.

The algorithm starts by checking if k is equal to 0 or n, in which case it returns 1.
Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with n-1 and k-1, or n-1 and k, and adds the results together.

Example usage: binomialCoefficient 5 2 =>
|  k = 0 -> 1
|  k = 2 -> binomialCoefficient (n-1) (k-1) + binomialCoefficient (n-1) k
