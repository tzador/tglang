-- This is a complex code snippet in ELM that takes in a list of words and returns a string containing all the words that start with a vowel

import String

vowelWords: List String -> String
vowelWords words =
    let
        vowels: List Char
        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

        vowelWords: List String -> List String
        vowelWords words =
            List.filter (\word -> List.member (String.toLower (String.left 1 word)) vowels)

        filteredWords: List String
        filteredWords = vowelWords words

        outputString: String
        outputString = String.join ", " filteredWords
    in
        outputString

-- Usage:
vowelWords ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Pineapple"] == "Apple, Orange"

-- Explanation:
-- This code snippet imports the String library to use string manipulation functions.
-- It defines a function named 'vowelWords' that takes in a list of words and returns a string.
-- The 'vowelWords' function is defined using let-in syntax to define local variables and return a final output.
-- The local variable 'vowels' contains a list of vowels.
-- The 'vowelWords' function uses list filtering and string manipulation functions to check if each word in the input list starts with a vowel and keeps only those words in the result.
-- The output string is created by joining the filtered words with a comma and space.
-- The code snippet also includes a usage example to demonstrate how the 'vowelWords' function can be used with a list of words, and the expected output is shown as a comment.
