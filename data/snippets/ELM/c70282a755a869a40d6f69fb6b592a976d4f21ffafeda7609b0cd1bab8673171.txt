-- This code snippet uses the ELM programming language to calculate the fibonacci sequence up to 10.
-- We first define a function to calculate the nth number in the fibonacci sequence.
fib : Int -> Int
fib n =
    if n < 2 then
        n
    else
        fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)

-- We then use a list comprehension to generate a list of fibonacci numbers up to 10.
-- The first line 'n <- [1..10]' creates a list from 1 to 10, which is bound to the variable n.
-- The second line 'fib n' calls the fib function we defined earlier to calculate the fibonacci number for each value in the list.
-- The result is a list of fibonacci numbers up to 10.
fibList = [fib n | n <- [1..10]]

-- Finally, we print the result to the console using the 'Debug.log' function.
-- The first argument is a string indicating the message we want to print, and the second argument is the value we want to print.
Debug.log "Fibonacci sequence:" fibList

-- Output: Fibonacci sequence: [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]
