-- The Todo type is used to represent different types of tasks.
-- SimpleTask is a task with just a title, while ComplexTask has multiple fields for title, description, priority, due date, and completion status.

-- The todoList contains a list of Todo objects.
-- The first item is a SimpleTask, while the other two are ComplexTasks with different fields filled in.
