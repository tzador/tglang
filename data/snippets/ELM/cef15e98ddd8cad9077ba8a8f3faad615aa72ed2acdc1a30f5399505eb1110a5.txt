-- Define a function to calculate the average of a list of numbers
averageList : List Float -> Float
averageList list =
    let
        sum = List.foldl (+) 0 list -- use foldl to sum up all the elements in the list
        len = List.length list
    in
        sum / Float.fromInt len -- calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list
