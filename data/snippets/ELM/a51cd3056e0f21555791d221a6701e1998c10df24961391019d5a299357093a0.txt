-- Define a type alias called `User` that takes in two parameters: `username` of type `String` and `age` of type `Int`
type alias User username age =
    { name: username
    , age: age
    }

-- Create a list of type `User` with two users
users : List User
users =
    [ User "Emily" 25
    , User "John" 30
    ]

-- Define a custom type `Result` with two constructors: `Success` and `Failure` that takes in a generic type `a`
type Result a
    = Success a
    | Failure String

-- Define a function `checkUser` that takes in a `User` and returns a `Result User`
checkUser : User -> Result User
checkUser user =
    if user.age > 18 then
        Success user
    else
        Failure "User must be over 18 years old"
