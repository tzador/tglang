-- This snippet creates a function "factorial" that calculates the factorial of a given integer
-- The function uses pattern matching and recursion

factorial : Int -> Int
factorial n =
    case n of
        0 ->
            1
        _ ->
            n * factorial (n-1)

-- An example call to the function, which will return the factorial of 5
factorial 5
