-- This is an example of a complex function in ELM

let
  -- Define a new type called 'Shape' with possible values 'Circle' or 'Rectangle'
  type Shape = Circle Float | Rectangle Float Float

  -- A helper function to get the area of a circle
  getCircleArea : Float -> Float
  getCircleArea radius =
    radius * radius * pi

  -- A helper function to get the area of a rectangle
  getRectangleArea : Float -> Float -> Float
  getRectangleArea width height =
    width * height
in
  -- A function that takes in a shape and returns its area
  getArea : Shape -> Float
  getArea shape =
    case shape of
      Circle radius ->
        getCircleArea radius
      Rectangle width height ->
        getRectangleArea width height

-- To use this function, we can pass in a shape and get its area
main =
  let
    circleArea = getArea (Circle 5)
    rectangleArea = getArea (Rectangle 3 4)
  in
    "The area of the circle is " ++ String.fromFloat circleArea ++ " and the area of the rectangle is " ++ String.fromFloat rectangleArea

-- Output:  The area of the circle is 78.5398163397 and the area of the rectangle is 12.0
