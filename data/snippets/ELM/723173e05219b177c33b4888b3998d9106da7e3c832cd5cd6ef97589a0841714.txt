-- This code snippet creates a function to calculate the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
fibo : Int -> Int
fibo n = let
    -- Internal function to calculate Fibonacci sequence using tail recursion
    fibo' n prev prev'
      | n == 0 = prev
      | n == 1 = prev'
      | otherwise = fibo' (n-1) prev' (prev + prev')  
  
  in
    fibo' n 0 1
-- Example usage: fibo 5 returns 3, since the 5th term in the Fibonacci sequence is 3.  
-- Explanation: The function takes in an integer n and uses tail recursion to calculate the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence, using two variables to keep track of the previous two terms. The initial values of prev and prev' are 0 and 1 respectively. The function first checks the base cases for n being 0 or 1, and returns the corresponding previous term if true. Otherwise, it uses recursion to calculate the next term by passing in n-1, the previous term, and the sum of the previous two terms. This process continues until the nth term is reached, at which point the final calculated value is returned.
