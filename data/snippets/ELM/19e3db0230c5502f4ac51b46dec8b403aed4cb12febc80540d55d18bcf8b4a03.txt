--- This code snippet provides an example of using ELM syntax to create a complex data structure ---

--- Define a custom data type called 'Fruit' with two possible values ---
 
type Fruit
    = Apple
    | Banana
 
--- Create a list of fruits using the custom data type ---
 
fruits : List Fruit
fruits =
    [ Apple, Banana ]
 
--- Define a custom data type called 'Color' with three possible values ---
 
type Color
    = Red
    | Green
    | Blue
 
--- Create a list of colors using the custom data type ---
 
colors : List Color
colors =
    [ Red, Green, Blue ]
 
--- Define a new data type called 'FruitBasket' that contains a list of fruits and a list of colors ---
 
type FruitBasket
    = Basket (List Fruit) (List Color)
 
--- Create a new fruit basket with the previously defined lists ---
 
basket : FruitBasket
basket =
    Basket fruits colors
 
--- Print out the contents of the fruit basket ---
 
main : String
main =
    toString basket
