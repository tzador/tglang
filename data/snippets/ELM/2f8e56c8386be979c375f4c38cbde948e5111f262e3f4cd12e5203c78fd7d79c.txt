-- This code snippet uses a recursive function to calculate the sum of a list of integers
-- and returns the result as an integer

-- Define a function called `sumList` that takes in a list of integers and returns an integer
sumList : List Int -> Int
-- Use pattern matching to define the base case when the list is empty
sumList [] = 0
-- Use recursion to calculate the sum of the list
sumList (x::xs) = x + sumList xs

-- Define a list with integers for testing
list : List Int
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

-- Call the `sumList` function on the `list` and store the result in a variable `result`
result : Int
result = sumList list

-- Print the result
-- This line is just for visual purposes
result -- Output: 15
