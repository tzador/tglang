-- This function returns a list of tuples containing two elements each,
-- where the first element is a list of all even numbers in the original list,
-- and the second element is a list of all odd numbers in the original list
evenOddList : List Int -> List (List Int, List Int)
evenOddList list =
    (List.filter (\n -> n % 2 == 0) list, List.filter (\n -> n % 2 == 1) list)
    
-- Example input and output:
-- evenOddList [1,2,3,4,5] = ([2,4], [1,3,5])
-- evenOddList [10,22,35,42] = ([10,22,42], [35])
