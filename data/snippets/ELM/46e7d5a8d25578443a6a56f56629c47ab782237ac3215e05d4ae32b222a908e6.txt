-- List Int -> List Int specifies that the function takes in a list of integers and returns a list of integers
-- "list" is the parameter name for the list of numbers being passed in
-- List.filter is a built-in function in ELM that filters a given list based on a given condition
-- \num -> num % 2 == 0 is an anonymous function that checks if a number is even (has no remainder when divided by 2)
-- "num" is the name of the parameter of the anonymous function
-- "==" is the equality operator in ELM
-- "0" is the value being compared to after the modulous operation
