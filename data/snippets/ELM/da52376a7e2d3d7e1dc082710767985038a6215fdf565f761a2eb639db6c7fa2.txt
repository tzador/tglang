{- Define a function to calculate the factorial of a given number -}

-- The function takes in an integer and returns an integer
factorial : Int -> Int

{- The base case is if the input is 0, the factorial is 1 -}
factorial 0 = 1

{- If the input is not 0, calculate the factorial recursively 
by multiplying the input with the factorial of (input-1) -}
{- The value of input-1 is passed into the function as the argument -}
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)

{- Example usage: -}
{- factorial 5 outputs 120 -}
