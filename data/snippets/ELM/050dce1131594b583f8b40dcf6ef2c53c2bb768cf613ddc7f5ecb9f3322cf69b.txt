--This function takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list
sumEvenNumbers : List Int -> Int
sumEvenNumbers list =
    let
        initialSum = 0 --initial sum is set to zero
    in
        List.foldl (\x y -> if even y then x + y else x) initialSum list
--This code snippet uses a higher order function List.foldl to iterate through the list and add only the even numbers to the sum. The result is then returned as an integer.
