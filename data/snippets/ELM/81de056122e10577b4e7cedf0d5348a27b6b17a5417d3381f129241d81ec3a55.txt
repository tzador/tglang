-- This code snippet imports the function "text" from the "Html" module, which allows us to output text into an HTML document.
-- The spaceFact function takes in an integer and returns a string with a space fact corresponding to that number.
-- The main function outputs the result of the spaceFact function with the argument 4, which will print "Saturn can float in water due to its low density."
