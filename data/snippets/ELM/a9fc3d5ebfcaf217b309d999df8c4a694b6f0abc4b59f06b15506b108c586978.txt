-- This code snippet is a function that takes in a list of integers 
-- and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

sumOfEvens : List Int -> Int
sumOfEvens myList =
    let
        -- Helper function that checks if a number is even
        isEven number =
            number % 2 == 0
    in
        -- Uses the built-in 'filter' function to filter the list for even numbers
        -- and then uses the 'foldl' function to sum all the numbers in the filtered list
        List.foldl (+) 0 (List.filter isEven myList)
