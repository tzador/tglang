-- Define a custom type called 'Shape' with two constructors
type Shape
    = Circle Float
    | Rectangle Float Float

-- Define a function called 'area' that calculates the area of a Shape
area : Shape -> Float
area shape =
    case shape of
        Circle radius ->
            3.14 * radius ^ 2
        
        Rectangle width height ->
            width * height

-- Define a list of Shapes
shapes : List Shape
shapes =
    [ Circle 5.0
    , Rectangle 5.0 10.0
    ]

-- Use a higher order function to map the 'area' function over the list of Shapes
areas : List Float
areas = 
    List.map area shapes
