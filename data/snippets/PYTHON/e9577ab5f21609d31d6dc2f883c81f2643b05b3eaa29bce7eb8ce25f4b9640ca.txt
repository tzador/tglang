This is a program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not.
A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.
Inputs: Year - an integer (positive)

# Get the year as user input
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# Check if the year is divisible by 4
# If the year is not divisible by 4, it is definitely not a leap year
if year % 4 != 0:
   print(year, "is not a leap year")
else:
   # Check if the year is divisible by 100
   if year % 100 == 0:
       # If the year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year
       if year % 400 == 0:
           print(year, "is a leap year")
       else:
           print(year, "is not a leap year")
   # If the year is not divisible by 100, but divisible by 4, it is a leap year
   else:
       print(year, "is a leap year")
