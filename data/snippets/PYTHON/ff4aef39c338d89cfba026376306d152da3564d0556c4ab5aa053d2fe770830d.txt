# This code snippet calculates the binomial coefficients 
# using dynamic programming 

def calculate_binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    #initialize a 2D array with default value of 0
    coeff = [[0 for x in range(n+1)] for y in range(n+1)]

    # Calculate the binomial coefficient using the recursive formula
    for i in range(n+1):
        for j in range(min(i, k)+1):
            if j == 0 or j == i:
                coeff[i][j] = 1
            else:
                coeff[i][j] = coeff[i-1][j-1] + coeff[i-1][j]

    # Return the coefficient at position n, k
    return coeff[n][k]
 
# Input values for n and k
n = 6
k = 3

# Print the result
print("Binomial coefficient of", n, "and", k, "is", calculate_binomial_coefficient(n, k))

# Output: Binomial coefficient of 6 and 3 is 20
