# This is a program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

# Function to calculate Fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(n):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sequence
    sequence = []

    # Loop from 0 to n
    for i in range(n):
        # If i is 0 or 1, add it to the sequence list
        if i == 0 or i == 1:
            sequence.append(i)
        # For all other numbers, add the sum of the previous two numbers to the list
        else:
            sequence.append(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])

    # Return the final sequence list
    return sequence

# Get user input for the number to calculate the sequence up to
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Call the fibonacci function with n as the argument
fib = fibonacci(n)

# Print the sequence
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", n, "is:")
print(fib)

# Output:
