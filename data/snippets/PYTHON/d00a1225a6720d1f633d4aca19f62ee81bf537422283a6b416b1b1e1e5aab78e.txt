# This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers.
# INPUTS:
# - numbers: a list of numbers
# OUTPUT:
# - sum_of_numbers: the sum of all the numbers in the list

def calculate_sum(numbers):
    # initialize a variable to store the sum
    sum_of_numbers = 0
    
    # loop through each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # add the current number to the sum variable
        sum_of_numbers += num
    
    # return the sum of all the numbers in the list
    return sum_of_numbers

# example input list
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# call the function and store the output
output = calculate_sum(input_list)

# print the output
