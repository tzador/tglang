# This code snippet will use a nested for loop and conditionals to check for prime numbers in a given range.

# Define a function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if the number is equal to 2 or 3
    if num == 2 or num == 3:
        # Return True because 2 and 3 are prime numbers
        return True
    # Check if the number is divisible by 2 or 3
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        # Return False because any number divisible by 2 or 3 cannot be prime
        return False
    # Initialize a counter variable
    i = 5
    # Use a while loop to check for prime using the square root of the number as the upper limit
    while i * i <= num:
        # Check if the number is divisible by i
        if num % i == 0:
            # Return False because any number divisible by i cannot be prime
            return False
        # Increment i by 2 to skip even numbers
        i += 2
    # Return True if all conditions are met (number is not divisible by 2, 3, or any number less than its square root)
    return True

# Define a function to print all prime numbers in a given range 
def print_primes(start, end):
    # Use a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        # Check if the number is prime by calling our is_prime function
        if is_prime(i):
            # Print the number if it is prime
            print(i)

# Call the print_primes function with a start and end value
print_primes(1, 100)
