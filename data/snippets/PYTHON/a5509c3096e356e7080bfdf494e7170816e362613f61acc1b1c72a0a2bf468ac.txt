### This code snippet generates a dictionary of prime numbers and their factors

# A function to generate the prime factors of a given number
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = [] # list to store prime factors
    d = 2 # smallest prime factor
    while d * d <= n:
        # check if d is a factor of n
        if n % d == 0:
            # add d to factors list
            factors.append(d)
            # divide n by d
            n //= d
        else:
            # increment d by 1
            d += 1
    # check if n is a prime number
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)

    return factors

# A function to generate a dictionary of prime numbers and their factors from 1 to n

    # loop through numbers from 1 to n

        factors = prime_factors(i)

        prime_dict[i] = factors

    return prime_dict

# generate a dictionary of prime numbers and their factors from 1 to 100
