# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number

def factorial(n):
    # base case, if n is 0 or 1, return 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # recursive case, calculate factorial by multiplying n with factorial of n-1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# take user input for number
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

print("Factorial of", n, "is", factorial(n))

# Sample input and output:
# Input: 5
# Output: Factorial of 5 is 120

# Explanation:
# This code snippet uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number. The base case checks if the number is 0 or 1, in which case it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively calls the function with n-1 until it reaches the base case. The user input is taken and passed to the function, and the result is printed. In this example, the factorial of 5 is calculated as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
