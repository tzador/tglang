# This code snippet generates a random password of 12 characters
# This uses the 'random' module from the python standard library
import random

# An array of possible characters to use in the password
characters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+=-[]{}.,/?<>"

# Initializing an empty string to store the password
password = ""

# Looping through 12 times to generate the password
for i in range(12):

    # Picking a random character from the array
    random_char = random.choice(characters)

    # Adding the random character to the password string
    password += random_char

# Printing the generated password
print("Generated password:", password)

# Output: Generated password: b1@ZuN]t9Gd#
