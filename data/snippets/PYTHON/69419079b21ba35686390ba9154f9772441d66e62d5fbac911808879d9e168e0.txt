# This code snippet is a complex function that checks if a number is prime or not
# It uses recursion to divide the number by all possible divisors

def is_prime(num):
    # Base cases to check if number is smaller than 2 or divisible by 2
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    elif num == 2:
        return True

    # Recursively check if number is divisible by all odd numbers from 3 to sqrt(num)
    divisor = 3
    while divisor * divisor <= num:
        if num % divisor == 0:
            return False
        divisor += 2

    # If no divisor found, number is prime
    return True

# Function call to check if number 97 is prime
