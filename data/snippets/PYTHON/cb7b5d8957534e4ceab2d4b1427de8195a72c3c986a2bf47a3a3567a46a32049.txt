#This is a code snippet in Python
#It generates a Fibonacci sequence up to the given number

#Define a function that generates a Fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(num):
    
    #Initialize an empty list to store the sequence
    seq = []
    
    #Initialize the first two values of the sequence
    a, b = 0, 1
    
    #Loop through the sequence until the given number is reached
    while a < num:
        
        #Append the current value to the sequence list
        seq.append(a)
        
        #Calculate the next value by adding the previous two values
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    #Return the generated sequence
    return seq

#Ask the user to enter a number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

#Call the fibonacci function and store the result in a variable
result = fibonacci(num)

#Print the result
print(result)
