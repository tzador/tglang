# This is a code snippet that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion

def factorial(n):
    # check if n is 0 or 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # use recursion to calculate factorial of n-1
    return n * factorial(n-1)

# asking user for input
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# calling factorial function and printing the result
print("Factorial of", num, "is:", factorial(num))
