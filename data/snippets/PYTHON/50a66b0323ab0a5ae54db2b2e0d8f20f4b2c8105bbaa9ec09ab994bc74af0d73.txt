# A function to find the factorial of a number

def fact(num):
    # Initialize the product variable 
    product = 1 
    # Loop through the range of the number, starting from 1 and ending at the number + 1 
    for i in range(1, num+1):
        # Multiply the product by the current number 
        product *= i 
    # Return the final product 
    return product 

# Sample input 
num = 5 
# Print the factorial of the number 
print(f"Factorial of {num} is: {fact(num)}") 

# Output: 
Factorial of 5 is: 120
