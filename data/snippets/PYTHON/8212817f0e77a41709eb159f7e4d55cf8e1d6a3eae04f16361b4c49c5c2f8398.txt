# This program takes in a list of numbers and calculates their sum and average
# using a for loop and if statement

# generate a list of numbers
numbers = [2, 5, 8, 3, 10, 6]

# initialize variables for sum and count
sum = 0
count = 0

# loop through the list of numbers
for num in numbers:

    # check if number is even
    if num % 2 == 0:

        # add number to sum and increase count
        sum += num
        count += 1

# calculate average
average = sum / count

# print sum and average
print("Sum: ", sum)
print("Average: ", average)
