# This program calculates the area of a circle
# It takes user input for the radius and uses the formula A = Ï€r^2

# Importing the math library to use the value of pi
import math

# Defining a function to calculate the area
def calculate_area(radius):
    
    # Using the math.pi constant and the radius to calculate the area
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    
    # Returning the area as the output of the function
    return area

# Getting user input for the radius
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# Calling the calculate_area function and passing in the user input as the argument
area = calculate_area(radius)

# Formatting the area to only show 2 decimal places
area = "{:.2f}".format(area)

# Printing the result
print("The area of the circle with radius " + str(radius) + " is " + str(area))
