# This is a complex function that takes in two lists of integers and returns the sum of the two lists.

# Define a function with two parameters, list1 and list2
def sum_lists(list1, list2):
    
    # Initialize a variable sum to 0, this will hold the sum of the two lists
    sum = 0
    
    # Use a for loop to iterate through the length of list1
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        
        # Add the current element from list1 to the sum variable
        sum += list1[i]
    
    # Use another for loop to iterate through the length of list2
    for j in range(len(list2)):
        
        # Add the current element from list2 to the sum variable
        sum += list2[j]
        
    # Return the final sum of the two lists
    return sum
