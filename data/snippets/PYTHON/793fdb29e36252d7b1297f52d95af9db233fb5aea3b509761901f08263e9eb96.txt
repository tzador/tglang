# This is a Python function that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number

def factorial(num):
    if num == 1: # base case
        return 1
    else:
        return num * factorial(num-1) # recursive call to calculate factorial

# To obtain the factorial of 5, we call the function and print the result
print(factorial(5))

# The output will be 120 (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120)
