# Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
def factorial(num):
    # Base case - if number is 0, return 1
    if num == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive case - calculate factorial using recursion
    else:
        return num * factorial(num - 1)

# Define a list of numbers
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use list comprehension to calculate the factorial of each number in the list and store in a new list
factorials = [factorial(num) for num in nums]

# Print the list of factorials
print(factorials) 

# Output: [1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
