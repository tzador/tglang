# This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list
def sum_even_numbers(list_nums):

    # Loop through the list
    for num in list_nums:
        # Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # If even, add it to the sum variable
