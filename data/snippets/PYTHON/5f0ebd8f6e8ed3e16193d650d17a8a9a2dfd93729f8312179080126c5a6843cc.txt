# This code snippet creates a class called Person which holds information about a person's name, age and address
class Person:

    # Constructor method to initialize the name, age and address of a person
    def __init__(self, name, age, address):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.address = address

    # Method to print the information of a person
    def print_info(self):
        print("Name: " + self.name)
        print("Age: " + str(self.age))
        print("Address: " + self.address)

# Creating an instance of the Person class with name, age and address as parameters
person1 = Person("John Smith", 32, "123 Main Street")

# Printing the information of person1 using the print_info method
person1.print_info()

# Output:
# Name: John Smith
# Age: 32
# Address: 123 Main Street
