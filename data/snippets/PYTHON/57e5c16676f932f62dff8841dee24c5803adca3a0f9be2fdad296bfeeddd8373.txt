# This code snippet creates a simple high low guessing game
# that allows the user to guess a randomly generated number
# between a specified range.
# Import necessary packages

# Generate a random number within the range

# Initialize variables
guesses = 0

# Welcome message
print("Welcome to the High Low Guessing Game!")

# Loop until the correct number is guessed or the maximum number of guesses is reached
while not correct and guesses < 10:
    # Get user input
    guess = int(input("Guess a number: "))
    # Compare user's guess to the random number
