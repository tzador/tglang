# This code snippet calculates the sum of all even numbers in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] # list of numbers
sum = 0 # initialize sum variable to 0
for num in numbers: # loop through each number in the list
    if num % 2 == 0: # check if number is even
        sum += num # if even, add it to the sum
print("Sum of even numbers in the list:", sum) # print the sum
