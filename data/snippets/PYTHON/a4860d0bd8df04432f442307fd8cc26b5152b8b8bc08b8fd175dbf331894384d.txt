# This is a code snippet that uses a recursive function to find the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
# The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence where each term is the sum of the two previous terms
# This function takes in the nth term as input and returns the value of that term

def fibonacci(n):
    # Base case: the first two terms in the sequence are 0 and 1, so their values are known
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case: for any other term in the sequence, the value is the sum of the two previous terms
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example of calling the function and printing the output
n = 10
print(f"The 10th term in the Fibonacci sequence is {fibonacci(n)}")

# Output: The 10th term in the Fibonacci sequence is 55
