# This program calculates the area of a circle using user-input radius

import math

# Define a function to calculate the area of a circle
# Takes in the radius as input
def calculate_area(radius):
    # Use the math.pi constant for pi and square the radius
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    
    # Return the calculated area
    return area

# Get user input for radius
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# Calculate the area using the defined function and round to 2 decimal places
area = round(calculate_area(radius), 2)

# Print the result
print("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", area)
