#This is a simple program that implements binary search algorithm to find a number in a list.

#Define a function to perform binary search
def binary_search(list, search_number):
    #Initial values for low and high indices
    low = 0
    high = len(list) - 1

    #Loop until the low index is less than or equal to high index
    while low <= high:
        #Calculate mid index
        mid = (low + high) // 2

        #Check if the search number is equal to the middle element
        if list[mid] == search_number:
            #Return the index where the search number was found
            return mid
        #Check if the search number is less than the middle element
        elif list[mid] < search_number:
            #Update the low index to be one more than the mid index
            low = mid + 1
        #Check if the search number is greater than the middle element
        else:
            #Update the high index to be one less than the mid index
            high = mid - 1

    #Return -1 if the search number was not found in the list
    return -1

#Create a list of numbers to search from
list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]

#Choose a number to search for
search_number = 13

#Call the binary_search function and store the result in a variable
result = binary_search(list, search_number)

#Check the result and print the corresponding message
if result != -1:
    print(search_number, "was found at index", result)
