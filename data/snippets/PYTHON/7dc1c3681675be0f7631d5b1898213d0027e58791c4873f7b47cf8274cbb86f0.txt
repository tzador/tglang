# This code snippet calculates the area of a circle with a given radius

# Importing the math module
import math

# Defining the area function, taking in the radius as a parameter
def area(radius):
    # Calculating the area using the formula A = Ï€r^2
    # Round the result to 2 decimal places using the "round" function
    area = round(math.pi * (radius ** 2), 2)
    # Return the calculated area
    return area

# Asking the user to input the radius of the circle
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# Calling the area function and passing in the inputed radius as an argument
circle_area = area(radius)

# Printing the calculated area to the user with a message
print("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area)
