# This function takes in a list and calculates the average of its elements
def calculate_average(list):
    # Initialize variables
    total = 0
    count = 0

    # Loop through the list and add each element to the total
    for element in list:
        total += element
        count += 1
    
    # Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of elements
    average = total / count

    # Return the average
    return average

# Example list
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# Call the function and store the average in a variable
avg = calculate_average(numbers)

# Print the average
print(f"The average of the list is: {avg}")

# Output: The average of the list is: 12.5
