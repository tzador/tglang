# This code snippet uses a for loop to iterate through a list of numbers, 
# checking if each number is a prime number and adding it to a new list if it is
# Then it uses a while loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they enter 'quit'
# It also incorporates a try/except block to handle any errors with user input

# list of numbers to check
numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

# empty list to store prime numbers
prime_numbers = []

# for loop to iterate through list of numbers
for num in numbers:
    # variable to keep track of divisible factors
    factors = []

    # for loop to check for factors
    for i in range(1, num+1):
        # if number is divisible, add to factors list
        if num % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
    
    # if only 2 factors (1 and itself), add to prime_numbers list
    if len(factors) == 2:
        prime_numbers.append(num)

# print out prime_numbers list
print("Prime numbers in the list are:", prime_numbers)

# while loop to continuously prompt user for input
while True:
    try:
        # store user input in variable
        input_str = input("Enter a number ('quit' to exit): ")

        # check if input is 'quit'
        if input_str == 'quit':
            break
        
        # convert input to integer
        num = int(input_str)

        # check if input is prime
        if num in prime_numbers:
            print(num, "is a prime number")
        else:
