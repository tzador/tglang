# This is a sample code snippet in Python

# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Loading dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('insurance.csv')
X = dataset[['age', 'bmi', 'children']]
y = dataset['charges']

# Splitting dataset into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Training a linear regression model
lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions on the test set
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)

# Calculating mean squared error
mse = np.mean((y_pred - y_test) ** 2)

# Printing the mean squared error
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
