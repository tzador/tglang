# This is a code snippet that assigns variables and performs complex mathematical operations

# Assigning variables
a = 5
b = 10
c = 15

# Performing mathematical operations
d = (a + b) * c / 2
e = a ** b - c
f = (c / a) + (b * d)

# Printing the results
print("The result of d is:", d)
print("The result of e is:", e)
print("The result of f is:", f)
