## This code creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
def factorial(num):
    fact = 1
    ## looping through numbers from 1 to the given number
    for i in range(1, num+1):
        ## updating factorial value by multiplying it with current number
        fact *= i
        ## printing the current number and factorial value
        print("Factorial of", i, "is", fact)
    ## returning the final factorial value
    return fact

## asking user for input
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

## calling the factorial function with user input as argument
result = factorial(n)

## printing the final result
print("Factorial of", n, "is", result)
