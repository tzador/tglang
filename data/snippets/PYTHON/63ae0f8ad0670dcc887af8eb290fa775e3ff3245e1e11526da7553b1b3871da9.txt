# A program that calculates the area of a circle
# Prompt the user to enter the radius
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# Calculate the area using the formula A = πr² 
area = 3.14159 * (radius ** 2)

# Print the result to the user
print("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", area)

# A program that calculates the volume of a cylinder
# Prompt the user to enter the radius and height
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the cylinder: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the cylinder: "))

# Calculate the volume using the formula V = πr²h
volume = 3.14159 * (radius ** 2) * height

# Print the result to the user
print("The volume of the cylinder with radius", radius, "and height", height, "is", volume)
