#This is a program that calculates the average of two numbers

#First, we define a function called 'calculate_average'
def calculate_average(num1, num2):
    #We add the two numbers together
    num_sum = num1 + num2
    #We divide the sum by 2 to get the average
    average = num_sum / 2
    #We then return the average
    return average

#Next, we get input from the user for the two numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

#We call the function and pass in the two numbers as arguments
result = calculate_average(num1, num2)

#Finally, we print out the result to the user
print("The average of", num1, "and", num2, "is", result)

#Sample output:
#Enter the first number: 5
#Enter the second number: 10
#The average of 5 and 10 is 7.5
