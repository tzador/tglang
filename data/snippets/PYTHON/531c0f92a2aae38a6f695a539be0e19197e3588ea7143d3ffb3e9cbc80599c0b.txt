# This code snippet calculates the value of pi using the Monte Carlo simulation method

import random
import math

# Set the total number of iterations for the simulation
total_iterations = 1000000
# Initialize variables to store the number of points inside and outside the circle
inside_circle = 0
outside_circle = 0

# Perform the simulation by generating random points inside a square
for i in range(total_iterations):
    # Generate random x and y coordinates within the square
    x = random.uniform(0, 1)
    y = random.uniform(0, 1)

    # Calculate the distance of the point from the center of the square (0.5, 0.5)
    distance = math.sqrt((x - 0.5)**2 + (y - 0.5)**2)

    # If the distance is less than 0.5, the point is inside the circle
    if distance <= 0.5:
        inside_circle += 1
    # If the distance is greater than 0.5, the point is outside the circle
    else:
        outside_circle += 1

# Calculate the value of pi using the formula: pi = 4*number of points inside the circle/total number of points
pi = 4 * inside_circle / total_iterations

# Print the result
print("The value of pi is:", pi)
