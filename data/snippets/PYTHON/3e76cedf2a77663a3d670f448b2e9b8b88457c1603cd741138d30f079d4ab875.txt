# This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
# Initialize variables
n = 10
fibonacci = [0,1]
# Use a for loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence
for i in range(2,n):
    # Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
    next_num = fibonacci[i-1] + fibonacci[i-2]
    # Add the new number to the list
    fibonacci.append(next_num)
# Print the Fibonacci sequence
print(fibonacci)
