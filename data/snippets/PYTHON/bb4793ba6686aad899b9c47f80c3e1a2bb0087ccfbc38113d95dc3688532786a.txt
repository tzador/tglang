# This is a sample code snippet in PYTHON
# The code creates a class called Book that stores information about a book
# The class has a constructor method that takes in parameters for title, author, and price
# The class also has a method that calculates the sales price based on a given discount

class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, price):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.price = price
    
    def calculate_sales_price(self, discount):
        sales_price = self.price - (self.price * discount)
        return sales_price

# Creating an instance of the Book class with the title "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen and the price of $20
book1 = Book("Pride and Prejudice", "Jane Austen", 20)
# Printing the title and author of the book
print(f"Title: {book1.title}")
print(f"Author: {book1.author}")

# Calculating the sales price of the book with a 15% discount
sales_price = book1.calculate_sales_price(0.15)
# Printing the sales price
print(f"Sales Price: ${sales_price}")
