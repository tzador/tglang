# Create a function to calculate the total cost of items in a shopping cart

# Define the function
def calculate_total_cost(cart):
    
    # Set the initial total cost to 0
    total_cost = 0

    # Loop through each item in the shopping cart
    for item in cart:
        
        # Get the price of the item from the dictionary
        price = cart[item]

        # Calculate the total cost by adding the price of each item to the total
        total_cost += price

    # Return the total cost
    return total_cost

# Create a dictionary representing the shopping cart with items and prices
cart = {'apple': 2.00, 'banana': 1.50, 'orange': 3.00, 'grapes': 5.00}

# Call the function and save the total cost in a variable
total = calculate_total_cost(cart)

# Print the total cost with a descriptive message
print(f"Total cost of items in shopping cart: ${total}")
