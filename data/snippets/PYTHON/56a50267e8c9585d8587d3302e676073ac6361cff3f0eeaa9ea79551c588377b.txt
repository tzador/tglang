    This function takes in a radius in meters and returns
    the calculated area of the circle in square meters.

    # Calculating the area of the circle using the formula A = pi * r^2
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)

    # Returning the area rounded to 2 decimal places
    return round(area, 2)

# Getting user input for the radius

# Calling the calculate_area function and storing the result in a variable

# Printing the result

# Sample input: Enter the radius of the circle in meters: 5
# Sample output: The area of the circle with a radius of 5.0 meters is 78.54 square meters.
