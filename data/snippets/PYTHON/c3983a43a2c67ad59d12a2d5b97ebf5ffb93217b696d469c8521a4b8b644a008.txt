# Define a function named "reverse" that takes in a string as a parameter
# and returns the reversed version of that string.
# The function should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.

        char_list[left], char_list[right] = char_list[right], char_list[left]
        # Move the left pointer one position to the right
        left += 1
