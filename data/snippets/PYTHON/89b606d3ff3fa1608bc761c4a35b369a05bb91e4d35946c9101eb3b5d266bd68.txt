# This is a complex Python code snippet that uses recursion to find the factorial of a number
# Define a function for finding factorial

    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # If the number is not 0 or 1, then use recursion to find the factorial
    else:

        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Take user input for the number whose factorial is to be found
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the number is negative, if yes then print an error message
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial cannot be found for negative numbers")
# If the number is positive, then call the function and print the result
else:
    print("Factorial of", num, "is", factorial(num))
