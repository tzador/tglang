# This is a function that calculates the factorial of a number
# It takes in one argument, the number whose factorial is to be calculated
# It returns the factorial of the number as an integer
def factorial(num):
    # Check if the input number is 0 or 1
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        # If so, return 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
        return 1
    # For other numbers, initialize a variable to hold the factorial value
    fact = 1
    # Use a for loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to the input number
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        # Multiply the current factorial value by the next number
        fact = fact * i
    # Return the factorial value
    return fact
