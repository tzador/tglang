### Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error 

### Reading and cleaning the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') # read in the dataset
df = df.dropna() # drop any rows with missing values
X = df.iloc[:, :-1] # select all columns except for the last one as features
y = df.iloc[:, -1] # select the last column as the target variable
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2) # split data into training and test sets

### Training and evaluating the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression() # initialize the linear regression model
model.fit(X_train, y_train) # train the model on the training data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test) # use the model to make predictions on the test data
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) # calculate the mean squared error between predictions and actual values
print(f"Mean squared error: {mse}") # print the mean squared error
