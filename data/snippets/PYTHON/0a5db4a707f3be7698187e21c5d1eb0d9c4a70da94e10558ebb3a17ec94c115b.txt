# This is a code snippet in Python that generates a random list of numbers
# and finds the median of the list using the statistics module

# import the statistics module
import statistics

# create an empty list for the numbers
numbers = []

# use a for loop to generate 10 random numbers between 1 and 100 and append them to the list
for i in range(10):
    numbers.append(random.randint(1, 100))
    
# use the statistics module to find the median of the list
median = statistics.median(numbers)

# print the original list and the median
print("Original list: ", numbers)
print("Median: ", median)
