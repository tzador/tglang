# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a user-input number

def factorial(num):
    # This function takes in a number and returns its factorial
    if num == 1:
        return num
    else:
        return num * factorial(num - 1)

# Get user input for number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check for negative numbers
if num < 0:
    print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
    print("Factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
    # Call the factorial function and print result
    print("Factorial of", num, "is", factorial(num))
    
# Sample output:
# Enter a number: 5
# Factorial of 5 is 120
