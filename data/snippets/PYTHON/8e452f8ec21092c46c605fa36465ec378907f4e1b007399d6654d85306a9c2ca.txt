# Define a function that takes in a list of numbers
# and returns the squares of each number
def square_numbers(numbers):
    
    # Create an empty list to store the squared values
    squared_list = []
    
    # Loop through the input list
    for num in numbers:
        
        # Calculate the square of the current number
        squared = num * num
        
        # Add the squared value to the list
        squared_list.append(squared)
        
    # Return the list of squared numbers
    return squared_list
    
# Example input list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Call the square_numbers function and store the result in a variable
squared_numbers = square_numbers(numbers)

# Print the output
print(squared_numbers) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
