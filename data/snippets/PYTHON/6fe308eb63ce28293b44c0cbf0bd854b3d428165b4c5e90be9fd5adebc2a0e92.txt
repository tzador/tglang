# This code snippet calculates the mean and standard deviation of a given dataset
import numpy as np                   # Importing numpy library for array operations

dataset = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]     # Defining the dataset as a list of values
mean = np.mean(dataset)               # Calculating the mean of the dataset
std_dev = np.std(dataset)             # Calculating the standard deviation of the dataset

print(f"The mean is: {mean}")         # Printing the mean value
print(f"The standard deviation is: {std_dev}")  # Printing the standard deviation value
