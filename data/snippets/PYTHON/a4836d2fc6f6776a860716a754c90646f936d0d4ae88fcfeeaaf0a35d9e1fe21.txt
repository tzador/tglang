## Defining a function that returns the nth Fibonacci number
def fibonacci(n):
    # Initializing variables for first two Fibonacci numbers
    a = 0
    b = 1

    # Using a for loop to calculate nth Fibonacci number
    for i in range(n):
        # Updating a and b by their sum for each iteration
        a, b = b, a + b

    # Returning the nth Fibonacci number
    return a
