# This code snippet is a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

# Define a function that takes in a parameter, 'num'
# The function will calculate the factorial of the number and return the result
def factorial(num):
    
    # Base case: if the number is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Recursive call to the function: 
    # the factorial of a number is that number multiplied by the factorial of its previous number
    return num * factorial(num - 1)
    
# Ask the user to input a number and store it in a variable 'n'
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Call the factorial function with the user input number and store the result in a variable 'result'
result = factorial(n)

# Print the result
print("The factorial of", n, "is", result)

# Output:
