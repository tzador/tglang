# This program takes in a sentence and counts the number of vowels in the sentence
def vowel_count(sentence):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] # list of vowels
    count = 0 # initialize count to 0
    for letter in sentence: # loop through each letter in the sentence
        if letter.lower() in vowels: # if the letter is a vowel (case insensitive)
            count += 1 # increment count by 1
    print("Number of vowels: " + str(count)) # print the total number of vowels
# call the function and pass in a sentence
vowel_count("Hello there, this is a sample sentence") # output: Number of vowels: 10
