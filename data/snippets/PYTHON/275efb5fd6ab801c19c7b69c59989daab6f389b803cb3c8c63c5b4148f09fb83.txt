### This code snippet demonstrates how to use list comprehension in Python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] # Defining a list of numbers

# Using list comprehension to square each number in the list and store it in a new list
squares = [num ** 2 for num in numbers] 

# Printing the original list and the squared list for comparison
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Squared list:", squares)

# Using list comprehension to create a new list of even numbers from the original list
evens = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0] 

# Using list comprehension to create a new list of odd numbers from the original list
odds = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0] 

# Printing the new lists of even and odd numbers
print("Even numbers:", evens)
print("Odd numbers:", odds)
