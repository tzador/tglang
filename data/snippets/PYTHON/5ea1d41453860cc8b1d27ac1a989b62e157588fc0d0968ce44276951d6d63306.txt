# This is a code snippet that uses a for loop and if statement to find the sum of all even numbers between 0 and 100

# Define a variable to store the sum
total_sum = 0

# Use a for loop to iterate through numbers between 0 and 100
for num in range(101):
    # Check if the number is even
    if num % 2 == 0:
        # Add the number to the total sum
        total_sum += num

# Print the output, which is the total sum of even numbers between 0 and 100
print(total_sum)
