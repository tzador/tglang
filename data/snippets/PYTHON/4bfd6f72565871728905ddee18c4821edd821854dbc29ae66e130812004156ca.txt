# This is a simple program that generates a random password.
# It uses the random and string modules to generate a password with 8 characters.

import random
import string

# Define a function called generate_password that takes in 1 parameter, length
def generate_password(length):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the generated password
    password = ''
    # Use a for loop to repeat the process until the desired length is reached
    for i in range(length):
        # Generate a random lowercase letter using the string module
        # and add it to the password string
        password += random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase)
    # Use the return keyword to return the generated password
    return password

# Get user input for the desired length of the password
length = int(input("Enter the desired length of your password: "))
# Call the generate_password function and pass in the desired length as an argument
new_password = generate_password(length)
# Print the generated password
print("Your new password is:", new_password)

# Output:
# Your new password is: mzxgyqtc
