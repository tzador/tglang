###This code calculates the average and standard deviation of a set of numbers using functions and loops###

#import necessary libraries
import statistics

#define a function to calculate average
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

#define a function to calculate standard deviation
def calculate_std_dev(numbers):
    mean = calculate_average(numbers)
    sum_of_squares = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum_of_squares += (num - mean)**2
    return (sum_of_squares / (len(numbers)-1))**0.5

#ask user for input
num_list = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by a space: ").split()

#convert input to list of floats
numbers = [float(num) for num in num_list]

#calculate average and standard deviation
average = calculate_average(numbers)
std_dev = calculate_std_dev(numbers)

#print results
print("The average of the numbers is:", average)
