# This program takes in a list of numbers and calculates the average of the list.
# It also checks if the average is greater than 50 or not.

# define a function that takes in a list of numbers as parameter
def calculate_average(numbers):
    # initialize a variable to store the sum of numbers
    total = 0
    
    # loop through the list of numbers and add them to the total 
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    
    # calculate the average by dividing the total by the length of the list
    average = total / len(numbers)
    
    # print the average rounded to two decimal places
    print("The average of the list is: {:.2f}".format(average))
    
    # check if the average is greater than 50 and print the result
    if average > 50:
        print("The average is greater than 50!")
    else:
        print("The average is less than or equal to 50.")
        
# define a list of numbers
numbers = [10, 25, 36, 49, 62]

# call the function and pass in the list of numbers as argument
calculate_average(numbers)

# Output:
# The average of the list is: 36.40
# The average is less than or equal to 50.
