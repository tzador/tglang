# This code snippet takes in a list of integers and sorts them in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
# Function to implement Bubble Sort
def bubble_sort(list):
  n = len(list)
  # Traverse through all elements in the list
  for i in range(n):
    # Last `i` elements are already in place
    for j in range(0, n-i-1):
      # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them
      if list[j] > list[j+1]:
        list[j], list[j+1] = list[j+1], list[j]

# Driver code to test the function
test_list = [19, 42, 7, 13, 27, 5]
print("Original list:")
print(test_list)

bubble_sort(test_list)
print("Sorted list:")
print(test_list)

OUTPUT:
Original list:
[19, 42, 7, 13, 27, 5]
Sorted list:
