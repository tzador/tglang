# Define a function that takes in a list of numbers
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    total = 0 # Initialize a variable to store the total sum
    for num in numbers: # Loop through the list of numbers
        total += num # Add each number to the total sum
    return total # Return the final sum

# Create a list of numbers

# Call the function and store the result in a variable
sum = calculate_sum(num_list)

# Print the result
