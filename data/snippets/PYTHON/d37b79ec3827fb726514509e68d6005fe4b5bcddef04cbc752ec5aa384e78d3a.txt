# This code snippet generates a random password based on user input for the desired length and complexity.
# The password will be a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

# Import necessary libraries
import random
import string

# Get user input for password length
length = int(input("Enter desired password length: "))

# Generate a list of possible characters for password
characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation

# Initialize an empty password string
password = ""

# Use a for loop to randomly select characters from the list
for i in range(length):
  # Randomly select a character from the list
  random_char = random.choice(characters)
  # Add the character to the password string
  password += random_char

# Print the randomly generated password
print("Your new password is: ", password)

# Output:
# Your new password is: dK$5jr^#O2
