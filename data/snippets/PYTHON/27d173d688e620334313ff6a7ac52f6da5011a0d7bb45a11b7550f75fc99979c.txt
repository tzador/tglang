# This is a program written in Python
# It is a simple calculator that takes two numbers 
# and performs the basic arithmetic operations on them

# Define a function for each operation
def add(x, y): # Function for addition
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y): # Function for subtraction
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y): # Function for multiplication
    return x * y

def divide(x, y): # Function for division
    return x / y

# Prompt the user to enter the first input and store it in a variable
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))

# Prompt the user to enter the second input and store it in a variable
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Print out a menu for the user to select the operation they want to perform
print("Select operation:")
print("1. Add")
print("2. Subtract")
print("3. Multiply")
print("4. Divide")

# Take input from the user for the operation they want to perform
choice = input("Enter choice (1/2/3/4): ")

# Use if-else statements to determine which operation was chosen and call the corresponding function
