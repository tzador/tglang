# This code snippet is a Python program that generates a random number and then uses the built-in 'range' function to loop through a set of numbers.
# We first import the 'random' library to generate random numbers.
import random

# We then define a function that will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
def generate_random_number():
    return random.randint(1, 100)

# We call the function and assign the returned number to a variable named 'number'.
number = generate_random_number()

# Next, we use a 'for' loop to loop through the numbers 1 to 10.
# Inside the loop, we use an 'if' statement to check if the current number is equal to the random number generated.
# If it is, we print a message indicating that the number has been found.
# Otherwise, we print the current number in the loop.
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == number:
        print("The number has been found!")
    else:
        print(i)

# Finally, we print the random number that was generated.
print("Random number:", number)
