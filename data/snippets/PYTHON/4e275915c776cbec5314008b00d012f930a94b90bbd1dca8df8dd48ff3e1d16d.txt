# This program takes a list of numbers, squares them, and then filters out the odd numbers

# Define the list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Use list comprehension to square each number
squared_numbers = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]

# Filter out the odd numbers using lambda function and filter() method
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, squared_numbers))

# Print the filtered list of even numbers
print("The list of even numbers after squaring is:", even_numbers)

# Output:
# The list of even numbers after squaring is: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
