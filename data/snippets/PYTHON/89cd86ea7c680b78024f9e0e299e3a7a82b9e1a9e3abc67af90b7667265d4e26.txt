# This function implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor between two numbers
# INPUTS: Two integers, a and b, where a > b
# OUTPUT: The greatest common divisor between a and b
# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(log(a))

def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)

# Driver code for testing the function
print(gcd(12, 4))
# Output: 4
