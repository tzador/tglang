# This is a code snippet in python that generates the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
# We'll use a list to store the numbers
fibonacci = [0,1] # first two numbers in the sequence
# Now we'll use a for loop to generate the remaining numbers and store them in the list
for i in range(2,20): # range starts at 2 since we already have two numbers and ends at 20 since we want 20 numbers in total
  # Next number is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence
  next_num = fibonacci[i-1] + fibonacci[i-2]
  fibonacci.append(next_num) # add the new number to the list

# Now we can print the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
print(f"First 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: {fibonacci}") # using f-strings to format the output

# Output: First 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181]
