# This program calculates the average of a list of numbers
def calculate_average(num_list):
    sum = 0
    for num in num_list: # loop through each number in the list
        sum += num # add the current number to the sum
    return sum / len(num_list) # divide the sum by the number of elements in the list to get the average

# Example usage:
numbers = [4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
avg = calculate_average(numbers)
print(avg)
# Output: 8.0
