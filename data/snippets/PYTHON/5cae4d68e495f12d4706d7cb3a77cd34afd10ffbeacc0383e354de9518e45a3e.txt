# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
n = int(input("Enter a number: ")) # take input from user
factorial = 1 # initialize factorial to 1

if n < 0: # check if number is negative
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif n == 0: # check if number is 0
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else: # if number is positive
   for i in range(1,n + 1) # loop to find factorial
       factorial = factorial*i # update factorial value
   print("The factorial of",n,"is",factorial) # print result

# Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
