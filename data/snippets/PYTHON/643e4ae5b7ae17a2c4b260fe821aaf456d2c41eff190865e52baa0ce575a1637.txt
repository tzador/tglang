# Define a function that calculates the area of a triangle 
def calculate_triangle_area(base, height): # Start of function declaration with parameters 
   area = (base * height) / 2 # Area calculation formula 
   return area # Return statement for the calculated area 

# Prompt user for base and height values 
base = float(input('Enter the base of the triangle: ')) # Convert input to float and assign to base variable 
height = float(input('Enter the height of the triangle: ')) # Convert input to float and assign to height variable 

# Call the calculate_triangle_area function with user input values 
triangle_area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height) 

# Print the calculated area with appropriate formatting 
print('The area of the triangle with base {} units and height {} units is {} square units.'.format(base, height, triangle_area)) 

## Output: The area of the triangle with base 5.0 units and height 6.0 units is 15.0 square units.
