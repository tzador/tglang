# This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list
def even_sum(numbers):
    total = 0  # total variable to keep track of the sum
    for num in numbers:  # iterate through the numbers in the list
        if num % 2 == 0:  # check if the number is even
            total += num  # add the number to the total if it is even
    return total  # return the total sum

# This is a sample list of numbers

# Calling the function and passing in the sample list
