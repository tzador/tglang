# This code will print all prime numbers between 1 and 100, excluding 1 and 2
# Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that are only divisible by 1 and itself

# define a function to check if a number is prime
# a number is prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself
def is_prime(num):
    # check if the number is 2, as 2 is the only even prime number
    if num == 2:
        return True
    # check if the number is 1 or an even number, as they are not prime
    elif num == 1 or num % 2 == 0:
        return False
    # loop through odd numbers starting from 3 (since 2 is already checked)
    # to the square root of the number (since factors come in pairs)
    for i in range(3, int(num**0.5)+1, 2):
        # if the number is divisible by any odd number, it is not prime
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    # if the number is not divisible by any odd number, it is prime
    return True

# loop through numbers from 1 to 100
for i in range(1, 101):
    # check if the number is prime
    if is_prime(i):
        # print the number if it is prime
        print(i, end=" ")  # end=" " is used to print on same line with a space in between

# output: 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97
