# This is a basic implementation of a bubble sort algorithm
# for sorting a list of integers in ascending order

        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            
            # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:

        # If no swaps were made in the current iteration, the array is already sorted
        if not swapped:
            break
