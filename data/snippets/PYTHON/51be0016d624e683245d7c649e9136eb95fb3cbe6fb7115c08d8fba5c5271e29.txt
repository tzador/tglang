# This code snippet calculates the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers

# import the statistics module
import statistics

# create a list of numbers
numbers = [12, 4, 17, 8, 21, 14, 6, 12, 8, 7]

# calculate the mean using the mean() function from the statistics module
mean = statistics.mean(numbers)

# calculate the median using the median() function from the statistics module
median = statistics.median(numbers)

# calculate the mode using the mode() function from the statistics module
mode = statistics.mode(numbers)

# print out the results
print("Mean: ", mean)
print("Median: ", median)
print("Mode: ", mode)

# Output:
# Mean:  10.9
# Median:  9.5
# Mode:  12
