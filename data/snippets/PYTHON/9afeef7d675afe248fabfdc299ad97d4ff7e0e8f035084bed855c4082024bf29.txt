# This program calculates the sum of the first n numbers
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Gets user input for the value of n

# Initializes a variable 'sum' to store the sum of the numbers
sum = 0

# Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to n
for i in range(1, n+1):
    # Adds the current value of i to the sum
    sum += i
    # Prints the current value of i and the updated sum
    print("Current number:", i, "| Current sum:", sum)

# Prints the final sum after the loop ends
print("Final sum:", sum)
