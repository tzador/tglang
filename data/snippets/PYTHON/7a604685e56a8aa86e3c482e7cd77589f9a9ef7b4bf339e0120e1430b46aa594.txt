#This code snippet calculates the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100
sum = 0                                          #initializing the variable to store the sum
for i in range(1, 101):                           #looping through 1 to 100
    if i % 2 == 0:                                #checking if number is even
        sum += i                                  #adding the even number to the sum
print(sum)                                        #printing the sum

#Output: 
2550
