# List Comprehension to create a list of tuples

# Creating a list of names
names = ["John", "Anna", "Peter"]

# Creating a list of ages
ages = [30, 25, 35]

# Using list comprehension to create a list of tuples from the above lists
# Output: [('John', 30), ('Anna', 25), ('Peter', 35)]
list_of_tuples = [(name, age) for name, age in zip(names, ages)]

# Printing the list of tuples
print(list_of_tuples)
