# Output:
# This code snippet imports the necessary libraries for performing linear regression in Python. It then loads a dataset, divides it into training and testing sets, and fits a linear regression model to the training data. It then uses the model to make predictions on the testing data and calculates the accuracy of the model's predictions. The result is then printed to the console.
