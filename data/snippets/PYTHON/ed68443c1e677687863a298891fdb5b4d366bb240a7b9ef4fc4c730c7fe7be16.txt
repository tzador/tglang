# This code snippet computes the sum of all even numbers in a given range

# Define the range variables
start = 1
end = 100

# Initialize a empty list to store even numbers
even_nums = []

# Loop through the range
for i in range(start, end+1):
    # Check if the number is even
    if i % 2 == 0:
        # Add the number to the list if it is even
        even_nums.append(i)

# Print the list of even numbers
print(even_nums)

# Calculate the sum of all even numbers using list comprehension
sum = sum([num for num in even_nums])

# Print the sum
print(sum)
