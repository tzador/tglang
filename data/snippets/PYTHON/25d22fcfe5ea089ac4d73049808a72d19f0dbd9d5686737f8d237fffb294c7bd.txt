# This code snippet is a function that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number.

def factorial(n):
    # Base case - if n is 0 or 1, return 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case - call the factorial function with n-1 and multiply it with n
    else:
        return factorial(n-1) * n
        
# Test cases to check the output
print(factorial(5)) # Output: 120
print(factorial(2)) # Output: 2
print(factorial(0)) # Output: 1
