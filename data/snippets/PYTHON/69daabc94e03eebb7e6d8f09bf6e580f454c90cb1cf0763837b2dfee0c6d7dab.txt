## Create a class called Student
class Student:

    ## Constructor method with student's name and ID as parameters
    def __init__(self, name, student_id):

        ## Initialize instance variables for name and ID
        self.name = name
        self.student_id = student_id

        ## Initialize an empty list to hold student's grades
        self.grades = []

    ## Method to add a grade to the student's list of grades
    def add_grade(self, new_grade):

        ## Append the new grade to the list
        self.grades.append(new_grade)

    ## Method to calculate the average of the student's grades
    def calculate_average(self):

        ## Initialize a variable to hold the sum of all grades
        total = 0

        ## Loop through the list of grades and add each grade to the total
        for grade in self.grades:
            total += grade

        ## Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of grades
        average = total / len(self.grades)

        ## Return the average
        return average

    ## Method to convert the student's name to uppercase
    def convert_to_uppercase(self):

        ## Use the built-in upper() function to convert the name to uppercase
        self.name = self.name.upper()

    ## Method to print the student's name, ID, and grades
    def print_info(self):

        ## Print the student's name and ID
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Student ID: {self.student_id}")

        ## Print each grade in the list of grades
        print("Grades:")
        for grade in self.grades:
            print(grade)

## Create an instance of the Student class with name "John" and student ID "123"
student = Student("John", "123")

## Add grades to the student's list
student.add_grade(95)
student.add_grade(80)
student.add_grade(87)

## Convert the student's name to uppercase
student.convert_to_uppercase()

## Print the student's information
student.print_info()

## Calculate and print the student's average grade
print("Average grade:", student.calculate_average())
