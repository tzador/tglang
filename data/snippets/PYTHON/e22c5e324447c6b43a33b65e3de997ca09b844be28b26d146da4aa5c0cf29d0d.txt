# This program demonstrates the use of nested for loops to generate a table of numbers
# The outer loop iterates through the rows
for i in range(1, 11):
    # The inner loop iterates through the columns
    for j in range(1, 11):
        # Multiply the row and column numbers to get the value in each cell
        result = i * j
        # Right align the number and add a pipe symbol to separate columns
        print(f'{result:>4} |', end=' ')
    # End the row by printing a new line
    print()
