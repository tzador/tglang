# This code snippet is for creating a dictionary of students' information

# Declaring an empty dictionary
students = {}

# Using a for loop to get information from user and add it to the dictionary
for i in range(5):
  # Getting the student's name
  name = input("Enter student's name: ")
  # Getting the student's age
  age = int(input("Enter student's age: "))
  # Getting the student's grade
  grade = int(input("Enter student's grade: "))
  # Getting the student's country
  country = input("Enter student's country: ")
  # Creating a temporary dictionary with the student's information
  student_info = {"name" : name, "age" : age, "grade" : grade, "country" : country}
  # Adding the temporary dictionary to the "students" dictionary with the student's name as the key
  students[name] = student_info
  
# Printing the dictionary of students' information
print(students)
