# This code snippet generates a random Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined limit

# Import necessary modules
import random

# Define limit for sequence
limit = int(input("Enter the limit for the Fibonacci sequence: "))

# Define function to generate Fibonacci sequence
def fibo(limit):
    # Initialize list with first two numbers in sequence
    fibo_list = [0, 1]

    # Loop until limit is reached
    while len(fibo_list) < limit:
        # Generate next number in sequence by adding previous two numbers
        next_num = fibo_list[-1] + fibo_list[-2]

        # Append new number to list
        fibo_list.append(next_num)

    # Return generated sequence
    return fibo_list

# Call function to generate sequence
sequence = fibo(limit)

# Print output with proper formatting
print("Fibonacci sequence up to {0}: \n{1}".format(limit, sequence))
