#This code snippet is a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers

#Define the function
def get_average(numbers):
    #Initialize variables
    total = 0
    count = 0
    #Loop through the list and add each number to the total and increment count by 1
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
        count += 1
    #Calculate the average by dividing the total by the count
    average = total / count
    #Return the average
    return average
    
#Create a list of numbers
numbers = [10, 5, 6, 18, 3, 12]
#Call the function and store the output in a variable
result = get_average(numbers)
#Print the average
print("The average is:", result)
