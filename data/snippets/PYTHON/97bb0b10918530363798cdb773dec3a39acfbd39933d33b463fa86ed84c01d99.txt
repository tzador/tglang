# This code snippet checks if a number is prime or not
# A prime number is defined as a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself
# We will use a for loop to check all the numbers from 2 to the input number
# If the input number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is not prime
# If there are no such numbers, the input number is prime
# We will use the modulus operator (%) to check for divisibility

# Define a function to check if a number is prime
def check_prime(number):
    # Initialize a boolean variable to store the result
    is_prime = True

    # Use a for loop to iterate through all numbers from 2 to the input number
    for i in range(2, number):
        # Check if the input number is divisible by the current number in the loop
        if number % i == 0:
            # If it is divisible, change the boolean variable to False
            is_prime = False
            # Break out of the loop since we already know the input number is not prime
            break

    # Check the boolean variable to determine if the input number is prime or not
    if is_prime:
        print(number, "is a prime number")
    else:
        print(number, "is not a prime number")

# Call the function with an input number
check_prime(19)

# Output: 19 is a prime number
