### This code snippet takes in a list of numbers and checks if each number is divisible by a certain factor.

# Define the list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12]

# Define the factor to check divisibility against
factor = 3

# Create a new list to store the numbers that are divisible by the factor
divisible_numbers = []

# Loop through the list of numbers
for num in numbers:
    # Check if the number is divisible by the factor
    if num % factor == 0:
        # If it is, add it to the new list
        divisible_numbers.append(num)

# Print the list of numbers that are divisible by the factor
print(divisible_numbers)
