#This program will calculate the area of a circle given the radius.
#The user will input the radius of the circle.
#The program will then calculate the area and print it to the console.

#Importing the math library to use the pi constant.
import math

#Defining a function that will calculate the area of a circle.
#This function takes in one parameter, the radius of the circle.
def calculate_area(radius):
    #Using the pi constant from the math library and multiplying it by the radius squared.
    area = math.pi * (radius**2)
    #Returning the value of the area variable.
    return area

#Taking input from the user using the input() function.
#The input is converted to float as the radius can be a decimal value.
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

#Calling the calculate_area function and passing in the radius inputted by the user.
#The returned value is then stored in the area variable.
area = calculate_area(radius)

#Printing the result to the console using the print() function.
print("The area of the circle with radius {} is: {}".format(radius, area))

#Sample Output:
#Enter the radius of the circle: 5
#The area of the circle with radius 5.0 is: 78.53981633974483
