# This is a code snippet to find the maximum profit from a list of stock prices

# Input the stock prices as a list
prices = [10, 25, 15, 12, 30, 20, 24]

# Initialize variables for maximum profit and current minimum price
max_profit = 0
min_price = prices[0]

# Loop through the list of prices
for price in prices:
    
    # Update the maximum profit if the difference between current price and minimum price is greater than max profit
    if price - min_price > max_profit:
        max_profit = price - min_price
    
    # Update the current minimum price if the current price is lower than current minimum price
    if price < min_price:
        min_price = price
        
# Print the maximum profit
print(max_profit)
