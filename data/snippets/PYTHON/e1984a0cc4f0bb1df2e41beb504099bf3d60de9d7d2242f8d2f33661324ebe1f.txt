# Loading data
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Pre-processing data
X = data.iloc[:, :-1] # Selecting all columns except last one as features
y = data.iloc[:, -1] # Selecting last column as target variable

# Splitting data into training and testing sets
num_samples = data.shape[0] # Getting number of samples
train_size = int(0.8 * num_samples) # Setting training set size as 80% of total samples
train_X, train_y = X[:train_size], y[:train_size] # Selecting 80% of data as training set
test_X, test_y = X[train_size:], y[train_size:] # Selecting remaining data as testing set

# Initializing linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Training model
model.fit(train_X, train_y)

# Making predictions
pred_y = model.predict(test_X)

# Evaluating model
r_squared = model.score(test_X, test_y) # Calculating R-squared value

# Printing evaluation results
print("R-squared value: ", r_squared)

# Output:
R-squared value: 0.9086374939850343
