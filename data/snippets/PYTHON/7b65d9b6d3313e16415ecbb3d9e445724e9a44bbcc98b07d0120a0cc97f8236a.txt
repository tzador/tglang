# This is a Python code snippet that calculates the factorial of a number

def factorial(n): # define a function that takes in a number as an input
    result = 1 # initialize the result variable to 1
    for i in range(1,n+1): # iterate through numbers from 1 to n+1
        result = result * i # multiply the result by the current number
    return result # return the result of the factorial

num = 5 # assign a number to the variable num
print("Factorial of", num, "is", factorial(num)) # print the result of the factorial function
