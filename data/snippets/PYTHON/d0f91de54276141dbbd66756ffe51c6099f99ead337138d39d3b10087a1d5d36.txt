# This code snippet creates a list of numbers
# and uses a for loop to find the square of each number
# and adds it to a new list

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 18]

# Create an empty list to hold the squared numbers
squared_numbers = []

# Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers list
for number in numbers:
    
    # Find the square of each number and add it to the squared_numbers list
    square = number ** 2
    squared_numbers.append(square)
    
# Print the squared_numbers list
print(squared_numbers)
