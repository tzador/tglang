# This code snippet uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number.
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: if n is equal to 0 or 1, return 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case: multiply n by the factorial of n-1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
# Ask user to input a number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# Call the factorial function and print the result
result = factorial(num)
print("The factorial of " + str(num) + " is " + str(result))
