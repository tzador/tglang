### This code snippet is a simple example of how to create a function and use recursion to print a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. 

def fibonacci(n): # define function to print Fibonacci sequence
    if n <= 1: # base case: stops recursion when n reaches 0 or 1
        return n # returns current number
    else: # recursive case
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) # calls fibonacci function for previous two numbers and adds them together

# take user input for desired number of terms in Fibonacci sequence
num_terms = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

# iterate through the sequence and print each term
for i in range(num_terms):
    print(fibonacci(i), end=" ")
    
# sample output for input of 10: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
