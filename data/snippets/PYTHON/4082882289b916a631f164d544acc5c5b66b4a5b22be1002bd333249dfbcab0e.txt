# This code snippet uses a for loop and conditional statements to create a list of prime numbers within a specific range.

# Define the range to check for prime numbers
start = 2
end = 50

# Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
prime_numbers = []

# Iterate through the range using a for loop
for num in range(start, end+1):
    # For each number, check if it is divisible by any number between 2 and itself
    for i in range(2, num): 
        if (num % i) == 0: # If it is divisible, it is not a prime number
            break
    else:
        prime_numbers.append(num) # If it is not divisible, it is a prime number and is added to the list

# Print the list of prime numbers
print(prime_numbers)

# Output:
# [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
