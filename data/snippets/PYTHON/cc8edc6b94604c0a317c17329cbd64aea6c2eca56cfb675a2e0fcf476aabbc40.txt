# This is a Python code snippet that uses the numpy library to perform matrix operations
import numpy as np  # Importing the numpy library

# Creating two 3x3 matrices
matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
matrix2 = np.array([[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]])

# Performing matrix addition
matrix_sum = matrix1 + matrix2

# Displaying the result
print("The sum of the two matrices is:")
print(matrix_sum)

# Performing matrix multiplication
matrix_product = np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)

# Displaying the result
print("The product of the two matrices is:")
print(matrix_product)

# Performing matrix transposition
matrix_transpose = matrix1.T

# Displaying the result
print("The transpose of the first matrix is:")
print(matrix_transpose)

# Performing matrix inversion
matrix_inverse = np.linalg.inv(matrix2)

# Displaying the result
print("The inverse of the second matrix is:")
