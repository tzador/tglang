# This code snippet generates a sorted list of numbers from 1 to 10
# using a for loop and a conditional statement
numbers = [5, 2, 7, 3, 4, 1, 9, 10, 8, 6] # creates an unsorted list of numbers
sorted_numbers = [] # creates an empty list to store the sorted numbers
for num in numbers: # loops through each number in the list
    if num % 2 == 0: # checks if the number is even
        sorted_numbers.append(num) # adds the even number to the sorted list
sorted_numbers.sort() # sorts the list in ascending order
print(sorted_numbers) # outputs the sorted list
