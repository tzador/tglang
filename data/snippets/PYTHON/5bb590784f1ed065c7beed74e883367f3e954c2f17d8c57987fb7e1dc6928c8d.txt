# This is a complex code snippet in PYTHON that implements the quicksort algorithm

# Helper function to divide the list into smaller sublists
def partition(lst, low, high):
    # Select the pivot element as the last element in the list
    pivot = lst[high]
    # Index of the smaller element
    i = low - 1

    # Loop through the sublist and move elements smaller than the pivot to the left
    for j in range(low, high):
        # If the current element is smaller than the pivot
        if lst[j] < pivot:
            # Increment the index of the smaller element
            i += 1
            # Swap the current element with the element at the smaller index
            lst[i], lst[j] = lst[j], lst[i]
    
    # Swap the pivot element with the element at the smaller index
    lst[i+1], lst[high] = lst[high], lst[i+1]
    # Return the index of the pivot element
    return i+1

# Function to implement the quicksort algorithm
def quicksort(lst, low, high):
    # If the low index is smaller than the high index
    if low < high:
        # Partition the list and obtain the index of the pivot element
        pivot_index = partition(lst, low, high)
        # Recursively call quicksort on the sublist before and after the pivot element
        quicksort(lst, low, pivot_index-1)
        quicksort(lst, pivot_index+1, high)

# Example list to be sorted using quicksort
lst = [5, 3, 7, 1, 9, 2]

# Call the quicksort function
quicksort(lst, 0, len(lst)-1)
# Print the sorted list
print(lst)

# Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
