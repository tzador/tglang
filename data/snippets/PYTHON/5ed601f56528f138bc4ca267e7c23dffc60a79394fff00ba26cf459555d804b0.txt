#This code snippet calculates the fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms

#Function to generate fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(n):
    #Initializing first two terms of sequence
    a, b = 0, 1
    #Initializing a list to store the sequence
    seq = [a, b]
    #Iterating through the remaining terms
    for i in range(2, n):
        #Calculating the next term
        c = a + b
        #Adding the term to the sequence list
        seq.append(c)
        #Updating the values of a and b for the next iteration
        a = b
        b = c
    #Returning the sequence list
    return seq

#Taking user input for number of terms
terms = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

#Calling the fibonacci function and storing the sequence list
fib_seq = fibonacci(terms)

#Printing the generated sequence
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", terms, "terms:")
print(fib_seq)
