    '''
    This function takes in a list of numbers and calculates the average.

    Parameters:
        num_list (list): A list of numbers

    Returns:
        avg (float): The average of the numbers in the list
    '''

    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of numbers in the list
    total = 0
    
    # Loop through the numbers in the list and add them to the total variable
    for num in num_list:
        total += num
    
    # Calculate the average by dividing the total by the length of the list
    avg = total / len(num_list)
    
    # Return the average
    return avg

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

# Call the calculate_average function and pass in the list of numbers
average = calculate_average(numbers)

# Print the resulting average
print("The average of the numbers is:", average)

# Output: The average of the numbers is: 15.0
