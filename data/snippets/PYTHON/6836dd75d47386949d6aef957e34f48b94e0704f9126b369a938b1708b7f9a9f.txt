# This code snippet uses the NumPy package to perform matrix multiplication and reshape operations.

# Importing the necessary packages
import numpy as np

# Creating two matrices of different shapes to multiply
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) # shape: (2,3)
B = np.array([[7], [8], [9]]) # shape: (3,1)

# Performing matrix multiplication using the dot function
C = np.dot(A, B)

# Reshaping the resulting matrix to a 1-dimensional array
D = C.reshape(1, -1)

# Printing the final result
print(D)
