# This code snippet will calculate the factorial of a given number using a recursive function
def factorial(num):
    # Base case - returns 1 when num is equal to 0
    if num == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive case - calls the factorial function again with num-1 and multiplies it with num
    else:
        return num * factorial(num - 1)

# Takes user input for the number to calculate factorial of
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Calls the factorial function and assigns the returned value to result
result = factorial(num)

# Prints the result
print("Factorial of", num, "is", result)
