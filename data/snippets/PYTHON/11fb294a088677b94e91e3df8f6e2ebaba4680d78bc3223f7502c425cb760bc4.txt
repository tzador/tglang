# This is a code snippet using a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
# First, we define the function with one parameter, 'num'
def factorial(num):
    # We set the result variable to 1
    result = 1
    # We use a for loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to the given number
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        # We multiply the current result with the current number to get the factorial
        result = result * i
    # We return the final result
    return result

# We ask the user to input a number to calculate the factorial of
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# We call the factorial function and pass in the input number as an argument
factorial_result = factorial(num)

# We print the result
print("The factorial of", num, "is", factorial_result)
