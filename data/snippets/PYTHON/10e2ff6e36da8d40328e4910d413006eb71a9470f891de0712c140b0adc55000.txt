# This is a code snippet that creates a function to calculate the factorial of a number
# Input: num - the number for which the factorial is to be calculated
# Output: factorial - the factorial of the given number

def factorial(num):
# Checks if number is negative or zero
    if num < 0:
        return "Factorial does not exist for negative numbers"
    elif num == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        factorial = 1
        # Loops through numbers from 1 to the given number
        for i in range(1, num + 1):
            factorial = factorial * i
        return factorial

# Example output
print(factorial(5))
# Output will be 120 as 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
