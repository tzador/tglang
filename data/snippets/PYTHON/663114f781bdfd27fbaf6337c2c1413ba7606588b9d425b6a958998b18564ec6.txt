# This code snippet generates a random password and saves it in a text file.

# Import the necessary libraries
import random
import string

# Define a function to generate the password
def generate_password():
    
    # Specify the length of the password
    length = 10
    
    # Define a string containing all possible characters for the password
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "!@#$%&*"
    
    # Use a loop to randomly select characters from the string
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for i in range(length))
    
    # Return the generated password
    return password
    
# Call the generate_password() function and save the generated password in a variable
password = generate_password()

# Create a new text file and write the password in it
with open("password.txt","w") as file:
    file.write(password)

# Print a message to confirm that the password has been generated and saved
print("Password generated and saved in password.txt file.")

# Output:
# Password generated and saved in password.txt file.
