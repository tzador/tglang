# This code snippet generates a list of prime numbers between 0 and 100 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm

# Create a list of numbers from 2 to 100
numbers = [num for num in range(2,101)]

# Starting with the first prime number, loop through the list and remove all its multiples
for i in range(2, 11):

    # If any number in the list is a multiple of i, remove it from the list
    numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % i != 0 or num == i]

# The remaining numbers in the list are the prime numbers between 0 and 100
print(numbers)

# Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
