## This code snippet calculates the average score for a student ##

## Define a function that takes in a list of scores ##
def calculate_average_score(scores):

    ## Initialize a variable to store the sum of scores ##
    total = 0
    
    ## Iterate through the list of scores ##
    for score in scores:
        
        ## Add the current score to the total ##
        total += score
        
    ## Divide the total by the number of scores to get the average ##
    average = total / len(scores)
    
    ## Return the average score ##
    return average
    
## Create a list of scores for a particular student ##
student_scores = [85, 92, 78, 65, 95]

## Call the function and pass in the list of scores ##
average_score = calculate_average_score(student_scores)

## Print the average score ##
print(f"The average score for the student is {average_score}")
