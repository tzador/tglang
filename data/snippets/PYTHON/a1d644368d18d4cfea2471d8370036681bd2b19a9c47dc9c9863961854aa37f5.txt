def perform_linear_regression(X, y):
    '''
    This function takes in a dataframe of independent variables (X) and a series of dependent variables (y)
    and fits a linear regression model to the data.
    
    Parameters:
    X (pandas dataframe): dataframe containing the independent variables
    y (pandas series): series containing the dependent variables
    
    Returns:
    model (LinearRegression): trained linear regression model
    coefficients (numpy array): array of coefficients for each independent variable
