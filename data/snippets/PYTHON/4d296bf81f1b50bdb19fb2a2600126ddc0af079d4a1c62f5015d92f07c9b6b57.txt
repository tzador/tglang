#This code snippet generates a list of prime numbers within a given range
#First, we define a function that checks if a number is prime by dividing it with all numbers less than it
def isPrime(num):
    '''Function to check if a number is prime'''
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2,num):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
#Then, we define a function that generates a list of prime numbers within a given range
def primeList(upper_range):
    '''Function to generate a list of prime numbers within a given range'''
    primes = []
    for num in range(2,upper_range + 1):
        if isPrime(num):
            primes.append(num)
    return primes
#To print the list of prime numbers from 1 to 100, we call the primeList function with 100 as the upper range argument
print("List of prime numbers from 1 to 100:")
print(primeList(100))
#Output: List of prime numbers from 1 to 100: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
