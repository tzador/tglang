# This is a code snippet in Python that implements a recursive function to find the factorial of a number

# Define a recursive function to calculate factorial
def factorial(n): 
    if n == 1: # base case
        return 1 
    else: # recursive case
        return n * factorial(n-1) # calling the function within itself

# Take user input for the number
num = int(input("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: ")) 

# Check if the input is a positive integer
if num < 0: 
    print("Factorial cannot be calculated for negative numbers")
elif num == 0: # special case
    print("Factorial of 0 is 1")
else: # if input is valid
    print("Factorial of", num,"is", factorial(num))  # calling the recursive function to calculate factorial
