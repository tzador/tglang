#This code snippet creates a class called Student that represents a student in a school.

class Student:
    #This is the constructor method that takes in three parameters: name, grade, and age.
    def __init__(self, name, grade, age):
        self.name = name #sets the name of the student
        self.grade = grade #sets the grade of the student
        self.age = age #sets the age of the student
    
    #This method prints out the information of the student
    def print_info(self):
        print("Name:", self.name)
        print("Grade:", self.grade)
        print("Age:", self.age)
    
    #This method increases the grade of the student by one
    def promote(self):
        self.grade += 1
    
    #This method changes the age of the student
    def change_age(self, new_age):
        self.age = new_age

#Creating an instance of the Student class with name, grade, and age parameters
student_1 = Student("John", 10, 15)

#Using the print_info method to print out the information of the student
student_1.print_info()

#Promoting the student to the next grade
student_1.promote()

#Changing the age of the student
student_1.change_age(16)

#Printing out the updated information of the student
student_1.print_info()

#Expected Output:
#Name: John
#Grade: 10
#Age: 15
#Name: John
#Grade: 11
#Age: 16
