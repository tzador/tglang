# This is a simple program that prints a list of prime numbers up to a given amount
# Define a function that checks if a given number is prime or not
def isPrime(n):
    # Checks if the number is equal to 2, which is the only even prime number
    if (n == 2):
        return True
    # Checks if the number is divisible by 2 without any remainder, which means it is not prime
    if (n % 2 == 0):
        return False
    # Starts the loop from 3 to the square root of the given number with a step size of 2, since all even numbers are already checked
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, 2):
        # Checks if the given number is divisible by any number in the loop without any remainder, which means it is not prime
        if (n % i == 0):
            return False
    # If the given number is not divisible by any number in the loop, it is a prime number and the function returns True
    return True

# Gets the amount of prime numbers to be printed from the user
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
# A list to store the prime numbers
prime_list = []

# Loops from 2 (the smallest prime number) up to the given number
for i in range(2, num + 1):
    # Checks if the current number is prime by calling the defined function
    if (isPrime(i)):
        # If the number is prime, it is added to the list
        prime_list.append(i)

# Prints out the list of prime numbers
print("The prime numbers up to", num, "are:", prime_list)
