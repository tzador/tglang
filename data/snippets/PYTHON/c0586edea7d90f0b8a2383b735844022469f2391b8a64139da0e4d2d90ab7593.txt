# This is a code snippet in Python that incorporates a nested if/else statement
# and a for loop to print out numbers in a certain range

# Define the variables for the range of numbers
start = 1
end = 10

# Create a for loop to iterate through each number in the range
for num in range(start, end+1):
  
  # Check if the number is even
  if num % 2 == 0:
    
    # Check if the number is divisible by 3
    if num % 3 == 0:
        
      # Print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3
      print("FizzBuzz")
      
    # If the number is not divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
    else:
      print("Fizz")
      
  # Check if the number is divisible by 3
  elif num % 3 == 0:

    print("Buzz")
  
  # If the number is not divisible by either 2 or 3, print the number itself
