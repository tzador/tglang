# This code snippet uses the numpy library to calculate Fibonacci numbers

# Import the numpy library
import numpy as np

# Define a function to calculate Fibonacci numbers
def fibonacci(n):
    # Create an array to store the Fibonacci numbers
    fib = np.zeros(n+1)

    # Set the first two values in the array to 0 and 1
    fib[0] = 0
    fib[1] = 1

    # Use a for loop to calculate the remaining Fibonacci numbers
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        # Use the formula f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) to calculate the number
        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]

    # Return the array of Fibonacci numbers
    return fib

# Call the fibonacci function with n = 10
fibonacci(10)
