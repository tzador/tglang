# This program calculates the factorial of a given number
# User input for the number whose factorial is to be calculated
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# Initializing a variable to store the factorial value
factorial = 1
# A for loop to iterate through all numbers between 1 and the input number
for i in range(1, num+1):
    factorial = factorial * i  # Calculating the factorial by multiplying the current number with the previous factorial value
# Printing the result
print("The factorial of", num, "is", factorial)
