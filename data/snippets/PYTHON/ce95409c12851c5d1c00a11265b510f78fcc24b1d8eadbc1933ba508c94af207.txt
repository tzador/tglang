# This is a function that calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
# using recursion
def fibonacci(n):
    # Base case: 0th and 1st numbers in the sequence are defined as 0 and 1, respectively
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive case: the nth number is calculated by adding the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# User input to specify the number of terms in the sequence
num_terms = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

# Loop to iterate through each term and print its value in the Fibonacci sequence
for i in range(num_terms):
    # The term number is printed for reference (starting at 0)
    print("Term " + str(i) + ": " + str(fibonacci(i)))

# Example output when the user inputs 5 as the number of terms:
# Term 0: 0
# Term 1: 1
# Term 2: 1
# Term 3: 2
# Term 4: 3
