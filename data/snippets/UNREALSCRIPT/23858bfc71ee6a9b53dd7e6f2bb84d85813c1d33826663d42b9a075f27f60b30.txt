//Comment: This code displays a message when a player collects a power-up in a game
class PowerUp extends Actor //creates a new class called PowerUp that inherits from the Actor class
    placeable; //allows the PowerUp to be placed in the game editor
    
var int PowerAmount; //creates a variable to store the power amount
var bool bIsCollected; //creates a variable to track if the power-up has been collected or not

function CollectedPower() { //creates a function to handle when the power-up is collected
    bIsCollected = true; //sets the bIsCollected variable to true
    GEngine.Broadcast("Player collected a power-up!"); //displays a message to all connected players
}

defaultproperties { //contains the default properties for the PowerUp class (can be changed in game editor)
    PowerAmount=10; //sets the default power amount to 10
    bIsCollected=false; //sets bIsCollected to false by default
}

//in another class or event where the player collects the power-up:
local PowerUp PUPower; //creates a local variable to store the power-up object
PUPower = Spawn(class'PowerUp',,,PlayerPawn); //spawns a new power-up object and sets it to the local variable
PUPower.CollectedPower(); //calls the CollectedPower function on the power-up object
