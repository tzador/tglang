// This code snippet is an example of a class in unrealscript

// A class is a blueprint from which objects can be created
class PlayerController extends Object;

// The extends keyword defines the parent class of this class
// In this case, the PlayerController class inherits properties and functions from the Object class

// A class can have variables which define its properties
// These properties can be accessed and modified by objects created from this class
var const MaxHealth = 100; // a constant variable representing the maximum health of the player

// A class can also have functions which define its behavior
// These functions can also be accessed and called by objects created from this class

// The BeginPlay function is called when an object of this class is first spawned into the game world
// This is where we can initialize variables and perform any necessary setup
function BeginPlay()
{
    // First, we call the parent class' BeginPlay function to ensure that it is also executed
    Super.BeginPlay();

    // We can then call other functions or perform any additional setup here
}

// The Tick function is called every frame of the game
// This is where we can update our class' properties and behavior
function Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
    // First, we call the parent class' Tick function to ensure that it is also executed
    Super.Tick(DeltaTime);

    // We can then update any necessary variables or perform any necessary calculations here
}

// The DamagePlayer function is an example of a custom function defined in this class
// It takes in a parameter representing the amount of damage the player receives
function DamagePlayer(int DamageAmount)
{
    // We can modify the player's current health by subtracting the damage amount from it
    MaxHealth -= DamageAmount;

    // We can also check if the player's health has reached 0 and perform any necessary actions
    if (MaxHealth <= 0)
    {
        // For example, we can trigger the player's death by calling the Death function
        Death();
    }
}

// The Death function is called when the player's health reaches 0
function Death()
{
    // We can perform any necessary actions here, such as playing an animation or sound
}

// This is the end of the PlayerController class declaration
// Objects created from this class can now inherit and use all of its properties and functions
