//-----------------------------------------------------------
// This is a complex code snippet in UNREALSCRIPT, demonstrating the use of various built-in functions and variables.

class MyClass extends Object; // Declares a new class called 'MyClass' that inherits from the 'Object' class.
	Within WorldInfo // Specifies that this class only exists within the scope of the 'WorldInfo' class.
	// This class represents an object in the game world.

	/// Properties
	var int MyInt; // Declares a public integer variable called 'MyInt'.
	// All properties automatically generate a 'Get' and 'Set' function.

	/// Functions
	// These functions can be called by other classes or objects within the game world.
	function MyFunction()
	{
		MyInt++; // Increments the value of 'MyInt' by 1.
		Log("MyInt is now: " $ MyInt); // Uses the built-in 'Log' function to print the value of 'MyInt' to the console.
	}

	/// Events
	// These events are automatically called by the game engine.
	event Tick(float DeltaTime) // Represents the 'Tick' event, which is called every frame.
	{
		Super.Tick(DeltaTime); // Calls the 'Tick' function of the parent class, in this case 'Object'.
		Log("MyClass ticked!"); // Prints a message to the console.
	}

	event BeginPlay() // Represents the 'BeginPlay' event, which is called when the object is first spawned into the game world.
	{
		Super.BeginPlay(); // Calls the 'BeginPlay' function of the parent class, in this case 'Object'.
		Log("MyClass has been spawned!"); // Prints a message to the console.
	}
