/* 
 * Function: BabylonianSqrt
 * ------------------------
 * This function takes in a float Number and calculates its square root using the Babylonian method.
 * It uses a local float variable Approx to store the current approximation and updates it with each iteration.
 * The number of iterations to be performed is defined by the local int variable Iterations.
 * The final result is returned as a float value.
