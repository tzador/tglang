// This code snippet demonstrates the use of the #exec command in UnrealScript.

// The #exec OBJ LOAD command is used to load an external mesh file and add it to the game's package.
// In this example, the file "MyMeshes.msh" is being loaded and added to the current package.

#exec OBJ LOAD FILE=MyMeshes.msh

// The #exec OBJ SAVE command is used to save an existing mesh file with any changes made to it.
// Here, the file "MyMeshes.msh" will be saved in its current location.

#exec OBJ SAVE FILE=MyMeshes.msh

// The #exec COPY PACKAGE command creates a copy of a specified package and adds it to the game's package list.
// In this example, the package "MyPackage" will be copied and added to the current packages.

#exec COPY PACKAGE=MyPackage

// The #exec RM PACKAGES command removes one or more packages from the game's package list.
// Here, the packages "MyPackage1" and "MyPackage2" will be removed from the current packages.

#exec RM PACKAGES=MyPackage1, MyPackage2
