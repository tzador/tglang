//This code snippet is an example of a function in UnrealScript
function CalculateStats(out float Health, out float Armor, optional in float AttackPower)
{
    Health = 100.0; //initialize health to 100
    if(Armor > 50) //check if armor is more than 50
    {
        Health += Armor; //add armor to health
    }
    else if(Armor > 25) //check if armor is more than 25
    {
        Health += Armor/2; //add half of armor to health
    }

    if(AttackPower != None) //check if attack power was given
    {
        Health -= AttackPower; //subtract attack power from health
    }

    Armor = Health/2; //set armor equal to half of health
}

//To call this function, we use the following code
float PlayerHealth; //initialize variable to store player's health
float PlayerArmor; //initialize variable to store player's armor

CalculateStats(PlayerHealth, PlayerArmor, 50.0f); //call the function with an attack power of 50

//The values of PlayerHealth and PlayerArmor will be updated after the function is called
//and can be used in the game logic.
