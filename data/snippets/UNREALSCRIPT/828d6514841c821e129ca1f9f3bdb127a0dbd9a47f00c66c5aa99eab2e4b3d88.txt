// This is a long and complex UNREALSCRIPT code snippet

// Define a new class called "PlayerController" which inherits from the "Controller" class
class PlayerController extends Controller;

// Declare a variable "points" with an initial value of 0
var int points = 0;

// Declare a constant "MAX_POINTS" with a value of 100
const int MAX_POINTS = 100;

// Create a function called "CollectPoints" with one parameter "numPoints"
function CollectPoints(int numPoints)
{
    // Add the value of "numPoints" to "points"
    points += numPoints;
    
    // Check if "points" has exceeded the "MAX_POINTS" limit
    if(points > MAX_POINTS)
    {
        // If "points" has exceeded the limit, reset it to the "MAX_POINTS" value
        points = MAX_POINTS;
    }
}

// Create a new instance of the "PlayerController" class
PlayerController playerController;

// Call the "CollectPoints" function on the "playerController" instance and pass in a value of 50 for the "numPoints" parameter
playerController.CollectPoints(50);

// Print the current value of "points" to the screen
`Log("Current points: " $ points);`
