/*
This code snippet is a function in UNREALSCRIPT that checks if a given player's character is within a certain distance from an objective point on a map.

//Function name: CheckDistanceFromObjective
function bool CheckDistanceFromObjective(Pawn PlayerCharacter, Vector ObjectivePoint, float DistanceThreshold)
{
    // Get the player's current location
    Vector PlayerLocation;
    PlayerLocation = PlayerCharacter.Location;
    
    // Calculate the distance between the player's location and the objective point
    float Distance = VSize(ObjectivePoint - PlayerLocation);
    
    // Check if the distance is within the specified threshold
    if(Distance <= DistanceThreshold)

// Example usage:

// Check if the player's character is within 500 units from the (100,0,200) point
bool IsWithinDistance = CheckDistanceFromObjective(PlayerPawn, Vect(100, 0, 200), 500);

// If the player is within distance, display a message
