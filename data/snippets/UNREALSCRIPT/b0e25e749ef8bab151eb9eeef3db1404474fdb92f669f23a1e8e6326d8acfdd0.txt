class MyActor extends Actor
    // This is a class declaration in UnrealScript for creating an Actor named "MyActor"
    // Every actor in Unreal Engine inherits from the Actor class, which provides various functions and properties
    // The "extends" keyword is used to inherit from a parent class, in this case the Actor class
    // The class name must start with a capital letter, and it should match the name of the file

    placeable; 
    // The "placeable" keyword is used to specify that this actor can be placed in the level by a level designer
    // Actors that are not placeable can only be spawned at runtime through code

    replication;
    // Unreal Engine uses a client-server networking model, where the server simulates the game world and sends updates to connected clients
    // The "replication" keyword is used to specify that this actor should be replicated to clients, so they can see and interact with it
    // Actors with no replication keyword are only visible and usable on the server, and not on connected clients

    // Variables declared using the var keyword will be replicated by default, unless specified otherwise using the transient or replicated keywords
    var int Health;
    // This is a variable declaration for an integer named Health, which holds the health value of this actor
    // The "var" keyword is used to declare variables in UnrealScript, and it can be used for any data type

    // Functions prefixed with the "simulated" keyword will be run on clients as well as the server
    // This is useful for functions that modify replicated variables, as they need to be run on both the server and client for proper synchronization
    simulated function TakeDamage(int Amount)
    {
        Health -= Amount;
        // This function reduces the Health variable by the specified amount
    }

    /* The DefaultProperties block is used for specifying default values of variables and properties
    It is executed when the actor is spawned or the level is loaded */
    DefaultProperties
    {
        Health = 100;
        // This sets the default value of the variable Health to 100
