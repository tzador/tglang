class MyClass extends Object

	// The "extends" keyword means that this class inherits from the Object class, which is the parent class of all classes in UNREALSCRIPT
	// Object is a built-in class that provides basic functionality for all classes

	// Adding some variables to the class
	var Vector Location; // A Vector is a mathematical way of representing a direction and magnitude in 3D space
	var Rotator Rotation; // A Rotator is a way of representing rotation in 3D space
	var float Speed; // A float is a decimal number

	// Adding a function to the class
	function MoveTo(Vector NewLocation)
		// Indenting one level for proper syntax
		/*
		This function takes in a Vector parameter called NewLocation
		and moves the object to that location at the current Speed
		*/

		// Setting the Location variable of the object to the NewLocation parameter
		Location = NewLocation;
		// Using the MoveFromTo function from the Object class to move the object to the NewLocation
		MoveFromTo(Location, NewLocation, Speed);

	// Adding another function to the class
	function RotateTo(Rotator NewRotation)
		// Indenting one level for proper syntax
		/*
		This function takes in a Rotator parameter called NewRotation
		and rotates the object to that rotation
		*/

		// Setting the Rotation variable of the object to the NewRotation parameter
