class SpawnPoint extends Keypoint implements IDrawer
// This is a class called SpawnPoint that extends the Keypoint class and implements the IDRAWER interface
// This class is used to define a spawn point in a game level
// Spawn points are used to determine the initial location for a player or AI when spawning into a game level

// Attributes
    var float SpawnHeight; // The height at which the player or AI will spawn at this spawn point
    var Rotation SpawnRotation; // The rotation of the player or AI when they spawn at this spawn point

// Functions
