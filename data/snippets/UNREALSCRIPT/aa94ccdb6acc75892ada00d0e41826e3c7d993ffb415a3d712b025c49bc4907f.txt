/*
This code snippet is a function called MoveTo

and a float parameter called Speed which represents
the desired travel speed of the object to be moved.

Example usage of the MoveTo function:

// Move the object to a specific location with a speed of 500 units per second
bool Success = MoveTo(Vector(100, 50, 200), 500);

if (Success)
{
    // The object has reached the destination
    // Do something...
}
else
{
    // The object is still in motion
    // Do something else...
}
