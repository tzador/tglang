These two lines create a variable called Dexterity with the data type of float and sets it as a visible and editable property in the Unreal Editor. The third line creates a variable called TargetActor with the data type of class and restricts it to only hold objects of the MyActor class.

This creates a simulated function called TakeDamage that takes in several parameters including a float for damage, a Pawn object for who is causing the damage, and a vector for the location and momentum of the hit. It also restricts the damage type to only objects of the DamageType class. This function will be executed when the actor takes damage.
