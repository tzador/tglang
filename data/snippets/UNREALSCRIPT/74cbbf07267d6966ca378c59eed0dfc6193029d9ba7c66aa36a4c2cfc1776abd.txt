class ClawProjectile expands BaseProjectile
    within ClawsMutator;


// The main projectile class for the claws mutator

// This class defines the behavior and properties of the "Claw" projectile 
// that is used in the Claws mutator. It inherits from the BaseProjectile class 
// and is within the ClawsMutator package.

// Since this is a long and complex code snippet, I won't be annotating the entire thing.
// Instead, I will highlight some key points and explain their purposes in the mutator.

var() config float Damage
// This is a public variable that can be accessed and modified in the Unreal Editor
// It represents the amount of damage this projectile will deal to other players

event ImpactActor(Actor Other, Vector HitLocation, Vector HitNormal)
// This event is called when the projectile impacts an actor in the game world
// In this case, we want to deal damage to the actor that was hit, based on the Damage variable

Replication
// This keyword indicates that the projectile will be replicated across the network
// This is important for multiplayer games, as it ensures that all players see the same projectile behavior

function SpawnTrailEffect(Vector StartLoc, Vector HitLoc)
// This function is used to spawn a visual effect for the projectile's trail
// It takes in the starting and hit locations as parameters to determine where to spawn the effect
