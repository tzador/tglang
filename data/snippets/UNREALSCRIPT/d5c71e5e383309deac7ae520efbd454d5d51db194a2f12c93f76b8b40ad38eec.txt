class Sphere extends Actor
//Declares a new class called Sphere that extends the Actor class

var const editinline StaticMeshComponent StaticMeshComp
//Declares a variable called StaticMeshComp that is a constant and can be edited inline in the editor. It is of type StaticMeshComponent.

//Declares a new function called Init

//Calls the Init function of the parent class, in this case the Actor class

Begin:
//A label that is used to jump back to the beginning of the code, like a marker

ForEach AllActors(Class'Actor', Actor)
//Loops through all the Actors in the level of type Actor and assigns each one to the variable Actor

GotoIf(Actor == None, Begin)
//Gotos to the Begin label if the Actor variable is equal to None, meaning there are no more Actors to loop through
