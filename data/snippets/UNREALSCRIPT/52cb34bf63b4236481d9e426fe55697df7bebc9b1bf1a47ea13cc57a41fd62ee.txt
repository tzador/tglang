`class MyActor extends Actor;`

A complex code snippet in UNREALSCRIPT, creating a new class called `MyActor` that extends the `Actor` class. Any code within the backticks represents UNREALSCRIPT code and the contents of the code snippet are annotated with markdown.

The first line uses the `class` keyword to define a new class called `MyActor`. This class extends the built-in `Actor` class, denoted by the `extends` keyword and the class name following it.

Next, we can define properties and methods within the class, such as:

`var Vector MyLocation;`

This line declares a variable of type `Vector` called `MyLocation`. Within the UNREALSCRIPT syntax, declaring a variable starts with the `var` keyword, followed by the data type and the variable name.

We can also define functions within a class, such as:

`exec function FVector GetActorLocation()`
`{`
  `return MyLocation;`
`}`

This code snippet creates an `exec` function called `GetActorLocation()`, which returns a `FVector` (a vector in 3D space) representing the current location of the actor. The function body is contained within curly braces `{}`, as indicated by the markdown syntax.

The `exec` keyword is used to denote a function that can be called from the console or through remote procedure calls (RPC) via the network, making it a useful function for debugging and multiplayer functionality.

In order to use this class, we must create and spawn an instance of it, such as:

`var MyActor CreatedActor;`

`CreatedActor = Spawn(Class'MyActor');`

These lines create a `MyActor` object called `CreatedActor` and use the `Spawn()` function to instantiate it. The first parameter of `Spawn()` is the `Class` of the object, in this case, `MyActor`.

We can then use the `CreatedActor` object to access and manipulate the properties and methods defined within the `MyActor` class, such as:

`CreatedActor.MyLocation = Vector(100, 50, 0);`

This line assigns a new `Vector` location to the `MyLocation` variable of the `CreatedActor` object, placing it at (100, 50, 0) in 3D space.

Overall, this code snippet showcases some of the fundamentals of UNREALSCRIPT, including class creation, inheritance, variables, functions, and object instantiation. It also demonstrates some of the syntax used in UNREALSCRIPT, such as keywords and braces.
