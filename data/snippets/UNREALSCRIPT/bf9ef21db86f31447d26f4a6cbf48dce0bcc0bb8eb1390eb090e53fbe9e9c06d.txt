// This will be a code snippet demonstrating how to create a complex data structure in UnrealScript.

// First, we'll define a new class called "ComplexData".
class ComplexData extends Object;

// Next, we'll add some properties to our class to define the structure of our data.
// Here, we'll have a Name property of type String, an Age property of type int, and a List of Skills property containing strings.
var editconst Name, string name;
var editconst Age, int age;
var editconst Skills, string[] skills;

// Now, let's define a constructor to set initial values for our properties.
// We'll also add a function to add a new skill to our Skills list.
// Note: UnrealScript does not have built-in data structures, so we'll need to create our own using structs.
// In this case, we'll be using a struct called "Skill" which has a Name property of type String and a Level property of type int.
function ComplexData(string newName, int newAge)
{
    name = newName;
    age = newAge;
    skills = new string[];
}

function AddSkill(string skillName, int level)
{
    local Skill newSkill;
    newSkill.Name = skillName;
    newSkill.Level = level;
    skills.AddItem(newSkill);
}

// Now, let's create an instance of our class and add some skills to it.
var ComplexData myData;
myData = new (class'ComplexData');
myData.Name = "John Doe";
myData.Age = 25;
myData.AddSkill("Programming", 10);
myData.AddSkill("Game Design", 8);

// Finally, let's print out our data structure in a readable way.
// We'll use a ForEach loop to iterate through our Skills list and print out each skill's name and level.
foreach myData.Skills(skill)
{
    `Log("Skill: `$skill.Name` | Level: `$skill.Level`");
}
