//This code snippet is an example of a complex class definition in UNREALSCRIPT, which is the native scripting language for the Unreal Engine.
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//This class is called "MyActor" and extends the base class "Actor".
class MyActor extends Actor;

//Specifies the properties of the class, which can be accessed and modified in the editor.
//Here, we declare a variable called "health" with the property category "Gameplay" and a display name of "Health Points".
var(int) Health defaultproperties
{
    category = Gameplay;
    displayname = "Health Points";
}

//Specifies the functions that can be called on the class.
//Here, we declare a function called "TakeDamage" which takes in an integer parameter and decreases the health variable by that amount.
//It also checks if the actor's health is below 0 and destroys it if it is.
function TakeDamage(int DamageAmount)
{
    Health -= DamageAmount;

    if (Health <= 0)
