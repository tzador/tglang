/*
This is a complex code snippet in UNREALSCRIPT
It defines a new class called "MyClass" which extends the built-in CameraActor class and implements the interface "IInteractable"

Accessmodifier: private
This indicates that the class and its members are only accessible within their own package

Abstract: True
This makes the class an abstract class, which means it cannot be instantiated but can be extended by other classes

Transient: True
This indicates that the class will not be saved when the game is saved, and will be reinitialized on game load

Config: MyConfig
This defines a new config variable of type "MyConfig", which can be modified in the game's configuration files

Events:
- BeginPlay - called when the actor is spawned in the world
- Tick - called every frame
- Interact - called when the player interacts with the actor

Functions:
- SetMyVariable - sets the value of the "MyVariable" variable
- GetMyVariable - returns the value of the "MyVariable" variable

Variables:
- MyVariable - a variable of type "string" with the config specifier "EditAnywhere" allowing it to be modified in the editor

Usage:
To use this class, extend it and override the "Interact" function to define the desired behavior when the player interacts with the actor
