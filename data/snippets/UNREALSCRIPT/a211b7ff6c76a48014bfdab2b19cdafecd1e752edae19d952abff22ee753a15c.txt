/**
This code snippet contains a class for creating weapons in UnrealScript. The class inherits from the "Actor" class and contains properties such as Ammo, FireRate, Damage, and ClipSize. It also includes functions for firing the weapon, reloading it, and activating/deactivating it. The Fire function decreases the Ammo value and applies damage to a target using a LineTrace. The Reload function simply sets the Ammo value to the ClipSize, and the Activate and Deactivate functions toggle the Active property. */
