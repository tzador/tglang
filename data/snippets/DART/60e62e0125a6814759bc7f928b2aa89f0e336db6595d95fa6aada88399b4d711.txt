// This is a complex code snippet in DART
// It creates a class called "Person" with properties and methods

class Person { //Creates a class called "Person"
  String name; //Property named "name" of type string
  int age; //Property named "age" of type int

  //Constructor for the class, takes in name and age as parameters
  Person(this.name, this.age);

  //Method named "introduce" which prints out the name and age of the person
  void introduce() {
    print("Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.");
  }
}

void main() {
  //Creating an instance of the "Person" class with name "John" and age "25"
  Person john = Person("John", 25);

  //Calling the "introduce" method on the "john" object
  john.introduce();
}
