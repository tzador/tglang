// This code snippet uses Dart's Streams API to merge two streams and handle errors

import 'dart:async';

// Create two streams
final streamOne = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3]);
final streamTwo = Stream.fromIterable([4, 5, 6]);

// Merge the streams
final mergedStream = StreamGroup.merge([streamOne, streamTwo]);

// Handle errors
mergedStream.handleError((error) {
  print('An error occured: ${error}');
}).listen((data) {
  // Do something with the data
  print('${data} was emitted');
});
// Output:
// 1 was emitted
// 2 was emitted
// 3 was emitted
// 4 was emitted
// 5 was emitted
// 6 was emitted
