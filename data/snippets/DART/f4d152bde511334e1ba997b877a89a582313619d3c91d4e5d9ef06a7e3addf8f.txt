/*
    This function takes in two integers and returns their
    sum after checking if they are positive
*/
int sum(int a, int b) {
    if (a >= 0 && b >= 0) { // check if both numbers are positive
        return a + b; //if yes, return their sum

//Example
int result = sum(3, 5); //result is now 8
int result2 = sum(-2, 4); //result2 is now -1 as one of the inputs is negative
