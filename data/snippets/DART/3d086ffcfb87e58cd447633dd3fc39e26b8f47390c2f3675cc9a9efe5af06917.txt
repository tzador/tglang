/// This is a complex code snippet in DART that involves multiple classes and functions.

/// First, we define a class called 'Person' which has properties for 'name', 'age', and 'gender'.
class Person {
  String name; // Property for person's name.
  int age; // Property for person's age.
  String gender; // Property for person's gender.
  
  /// Constructor to initialize the 'Person' class.
  Person({this.name, this.age, this.gender});
  
  /// Function to print the details of the person.
  void printDetails() {
    print("Name: $name \nAge: $age \nGender: $gender");
  }
}

/// Next, we define a subclass of 'Person' called 'Student' which inherits all the properties from the 'Person' class.
class Student extends Person {
  String school; // Property for student's school.
  
  /// Constructor to initialize the 'Student' class.
  Student({String name, int age, String gender, this.school}) : super(name: name, age: age, gender: gender);
 
  /// Function to print the details of the student and their school.
  @override
  void printDetails() {
    super.printDetails(); // Call the 'printDetails()' function from the 'Person' class.
    print("School: $school");
  }
}

/// Finally, we create an instance of the 'Student' class and call the 'printDetails()' function to print their details.
void main() {
  var student = Student(name: "John Doe", age: 18, gender: "M", school: "XYZ University");
  student.printDetails(); // Prints: Name: John Doe, Age: 18, Gender: M, School: XYZ University
