/// This is a function that uses recursion to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
/// It takes in an integer n and returns an integer as the result.
/// The function first checks if n is 0 or 1, and if so, returns n as the result.
/// If n is greater than 1, it recursively calls itself to calculate the Fibonacci number.
/// Finally, it adds the two previous Fibonacci numbers to get the nth Fibonacci number and returns it.
