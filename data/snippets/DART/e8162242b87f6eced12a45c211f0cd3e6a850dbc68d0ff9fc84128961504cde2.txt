/* 
This code snippet illustrates the use of classes and inheritance in DART programming language.
A class named 'Animal' is created with properties of 'name' and 'age'.
Then, a sub-class 'Dog' is created which inherits the properties of 'Animal'.
An instance of 'Dog' class is created and its name and age are printed.
*/ 

// Define a class named 'Animal' with properties 'name' and 'age'
class Animal {
  // Class properties
  String name;
  int age;
  
  // Class constructor
  Animal(this.name, this.age);
}

// Define a class named 'Dog' that extends the 'Animal' class
class Dog extends Animal {
  // Class constructor
  Dog(String name, int age) : super(name, age);
  
  // Method to print the name and age of the dog
  void printDogInfo() {
    print("The dog's name is $name and it is $age years old.");
  }
}

// Create an instance of 'Dog' class
Dog myDog = Dog("Max", 5);

// Print the name and age of the dog using the 'printDogInfo' method
myDog.printDogInfo();

// Output:
// The dog's name is Max and it is 5 years old.
