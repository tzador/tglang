  // DART supports different types of variables

  // This is a multiline comment
  /* To define variables, you can use the `var` keyword
  followed by the variable name and an equal sign followed by the value */

  // In this example, we have a string variable
  // The value "Hello world" is assigned to the variable `myString`
  
  // We also have an integer variable
  // The value 5 is assigned to the variable `myInteger`

  // Lists are defined using the square brackets
  // In this example, we have a list with 5 elements
  // Each element is separated by a comma and can be of any type

  // Maps are defined using curly brackets
  // They consist of key-value pairs separated by a colon
  // In this example, we have a map with 3 key-value pairs

  // Booleans can be either `true` or `false`
  // In this example, we have a boolean variable with a value of `false`
