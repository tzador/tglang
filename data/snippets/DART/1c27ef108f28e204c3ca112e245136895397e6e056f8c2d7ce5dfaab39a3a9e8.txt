// Creating a function named 'calculate' that takes in two parameters, 'a' and 'b', and returns their sum
dynamic calculate(int a, int b) {
  var sum = a + b;
  return sum;
}

// Declaring and initializing two variables, 'x' and 'y', with values 10 and 5 respectively
int x = 10;
int y = 5;

// Calling the function 'calculate' with the two variables as arguments and storing the result in a variable named 'result'
var result = calculate(x, y);

// Printing the result to the console
print("The sum of $x and $y is $result");

// Output: The sum of 10 and 5 is 15
