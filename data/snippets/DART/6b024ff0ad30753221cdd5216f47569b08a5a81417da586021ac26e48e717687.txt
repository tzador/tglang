//Create a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the product of all the numbers
int multiply(List<int> numbers) {
  int result = 1; //initialize the result variable to 1
  for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) { //loop through the numbers list
    result = result * numbers[i]; //calculate the product of each number
  }
  return result; //return the final product
}

//Example usage
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
int product = multiply(numbers);
print("The product of $numbers is $product"); //output: The product of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 120
