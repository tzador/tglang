/// This function calculates the total cost of a meal including tax and tip.
/// It takes in three parameters: `subTotal`, `taxRate`, and `tipPercent`.
/// The `subTotal` parameter is the subtotal amount of the meal.
/// The `taxRate` parameter is the tax rate as a percentage.
/// The `tipPercent` parameter is the tip percentage as a decimal.

double calculateTotalCost(double subTotal, double taxRate, double tipPercent) {
  // Calculate tax amount by multiplying subtotal by tax rate
  double taxAmount = subTotal * (taxRate / 100);

  // Calculate tip amount by multiplying subtotal by tip percentage
  double tipAmount = subTotal * tipPercent;

  // Add subtotal, tax amount, and tip amount to get total cost
  double totalCost = subTotal + taxAmount + tipAmount;

  // Return the total cost rounded to two decimal places
