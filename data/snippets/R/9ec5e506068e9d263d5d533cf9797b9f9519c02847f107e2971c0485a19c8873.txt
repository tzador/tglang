# This is a complex code snippet using loops and conditional statements
# It generates a random matrix and then computes the mean of each row

# Set up the number of rows and columns
num_rows <- 5
num_cols <- 3

# Generate a matrix of random numbers with specified dimensions
matrix <- matrix(sample(1:100, num_rows * num_cols, replace = TRUE), ncol = num_cols, nrow = num_rows)

# Create an empty vector to store the means
row_means <- c()

# Loop through each row of the matrix
for (i in 1:num_rows) {
  # Set initial sum and count to 0 for each row
  sum <- 0
  count <- 0
  
  # Loop through each element in the row
  for (j in 1:num_cols) {
    # Add the element value to the sum
    sum <- sum + matrix[i, j]
    
    # Increase the count by 1
    count <- count + 1
  }
  
  # Calculate the mean for the current row and add it to the vector
  row_means <- c(row_means, sum / count)
}

# Print the final matrix and the mean for each row
print(matrix)
print(row_means)
