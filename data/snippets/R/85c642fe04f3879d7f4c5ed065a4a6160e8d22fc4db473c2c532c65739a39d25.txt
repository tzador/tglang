# Generating a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum
sum_list <- function(numbers) { # defining the function and its input
  result <- 0 # initializing the variable for the sum
  for (num in numbers) { # iterating through the list of numbers
    result <- result + num # adding each number to the sum
  }
  return(result) # returning the sum
}

# Calling the function with a list of numbers
sum_list(c(3, 7, 6, 2, 9)) # output: 27
