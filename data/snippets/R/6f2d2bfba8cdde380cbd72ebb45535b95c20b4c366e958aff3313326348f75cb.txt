# This code snippet creates a function that calculates the sum of squares of all numbers within a given range
# Input:
# - range_start: the starting number of the range
# - range_end: the ending number of the range
# Output:
# - total_sum: the sum of squares of all numbers within the given range

sum_of_squares <- function(range_start, range_end) {

  # First, create a vector with all numbers within the range
  numbers <- range_start:range_end
  
  # Next, square each number in the vector
  squared_numbers <- numbers^2
  
  # Finally, sum up all the squared numbers
  total_sum <- sum(squared_numbers)
  
  # Return the total sum
  return(total_sum)
  
}

# Example usage:
sum_of_squares(1, 10) # Output: 385
