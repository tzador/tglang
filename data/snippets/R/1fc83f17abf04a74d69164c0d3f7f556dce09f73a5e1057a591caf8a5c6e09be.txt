# This code snippet uses the iris dataset from the datasets package in R.
# It first performs a principal component analysis (PCA) on the data, 
# then plots the first two components colored by species.

# Load the datasets package
library(datasets)

# Load the iris dataset
data(iris)

# Perform a PCA on the data, using all columns except for the Species column
pca <- prcomp(iris[, -5])

# Plot the first two components, colored by the Species column
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col = iris$Species, xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")

# Create a legend for the plot
legend("topright", legend = levels(iris$Species), col = c("red", "green", "blue"), 
       pch = 1, bty = "n")
