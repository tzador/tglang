# This is a function to calculate the factorial of a number
# The function takes in a single integer input

factorial <- function(n) {
  # Initialize a variable to hold the factorial result
  result <- 1
  
  # Use a for loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
  for (i in 1:n) {
    # Multiply the current factorial result with the current number 
    # and store it in the result variable
    result <- result * i
  }
  
  # Return the final factorial result
  return(result)
}

# Example usage of the factorial function 
# Calculate factorial of 5
factorial(5)
