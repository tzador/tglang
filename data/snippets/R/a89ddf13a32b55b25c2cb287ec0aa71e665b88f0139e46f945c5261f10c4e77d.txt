# This is a complex code snippet in R

# This function calculates the sum of a list of numbers
# xs: a list of numbers
# returns the sum of the numbers in xs
sum <- function(xs){
  total <- 0 # initialize sum to 0
  for (x in xs) { # iterate through list
    total <- total + x # add current element to sum
  }
  return(total) # return the sum
}

# This function calculates the product of a list of numbers
# xs: a list of numbers
# returns the product of the numbers in xs
product <- function(xs){
  total <- 1 # initialize product to 1
  for (x in xs) { # iterate through list
    total <- total * x # multiply current element to product
  }
  return(total) # return the product
}

# Example usage
list <- c(1,2,3,4,5) # create a list of numbers
sum(list) # should output 15
product(list) # should output 120
