# This code snippet generates a function that calculates the sum of a vector of numbers along with its standard deviation

# Function for calculating sum and standard deviation
calc_sum_std <- function(vector) {

  # Calculation of sum
  sum <- 0
  for (num in vector) {
    sum <- sum + num
  }

  # Calculation of standard deviation
  mean <- sum / length(vector)
  std <- 0
  for (num in vector) {
    std <- std + (num - mean)^2
  }
  std <- sqrt(std / (length(vector) - 1))

  # Output the sum and standard deviation
  cat("The sum of the vector is", sum, "and its standard deviation is", std)
}

# Example input vector
vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Calling the function
calc_sum_std(vector)

# Output:
The sum of the vector is 15 and its standard deviation is 1.581139
