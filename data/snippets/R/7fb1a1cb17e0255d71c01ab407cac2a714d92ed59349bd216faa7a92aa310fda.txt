# This is a code snippet in R
# It generates a random matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns
# and then calculates the mean of each column
# followed by plotting a bar graph of the means

# Generate random matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns
matrix <- matrix(runif(12), nrow = 3, ncol = 4)

# Calculate the mean of each column
mean_values <- colMeans(matrix)

# Plot a bar graph of the means
barplot(mean_values, names.arg = colnames(matrix), xlab = "Columns", ylab = "Mean", main = "Mean Values", col = "blue", border = "black", xlim = c(0, 5))
