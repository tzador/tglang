# This is a complex code snippet that creates a dataframe and performs multiple calculations on the data.
# Create a dataframe with three columns: "Country", "Population (millions)", and "HDI"
df <- data.frame(Country = c("USA", "China", "Japan", "Germany", "India"),
                 Population = c(328, 1393, 126, 83, 1380),
                 HDI = c(0.926, 0.761, 0.919, 0.947, 0.647))

# Add a new column with the population in billions
df$Population_Billions <- df$Population / 1000

# Calculate the average HDI of the countries
avg_HDI <- mean(df$HDI)

# Create a new dataframe with countries with HDI above the average
high_HDI <- df[df$HDI > avg_HDI, ]

# Calculate the total population of high-HDI countries
total_pop <- sum(high_HDI$Population_Billions)

# Print the results
print(paste0("The average HDI of the countries is ", avg_HDI))
print(paste0("The total population of high-HDI countries is ", total_pop))
