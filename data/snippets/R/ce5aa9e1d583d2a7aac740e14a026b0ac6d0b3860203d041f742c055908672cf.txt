# This code snippet creates a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

# Defining the function, with a parameter 'n' for the maximum number in the sequence
fibonacci <- function(n) {
  
  # Initializing the first two numbers in the sequence
  numbers <- numeric(n)
  numbers[1] <- 0
  numbers[2] <- 1
  
  # Loop through the sequence, starting from the third number
  for (i in seq(3, n)) {
    
    # Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
    numbers[i] <- numbers[i - 1] + numbers[i - 2]
  }
  
  # Return the final sequence
  return(numbers)
}

# Print the Fibonacci sequence up to a maximum of 10 numbers
fibonacci(10)
