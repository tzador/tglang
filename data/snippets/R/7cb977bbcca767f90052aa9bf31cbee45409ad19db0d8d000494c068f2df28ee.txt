# This snippet creates a function that takes in a vector and returns the mean

# Define the function
get_mean <- function(input_vector) {

  # Calculate the sum of the vector
  total_sum <- sum(input_vector)

  # Calculate the length of the vector
  vector_length <- length(input_vector)

  # Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the length
  mean <- total_sum / vector_length

  # Return the calculated mean
  return(mean)
}

# Generate a random vector of length 10
random_vector <- runif(10)

# Call the function with the generated vector
mean_value <- get_mean(random_vector)

# Print the result
print(paste("The mean of the vector is:", mean_value))
