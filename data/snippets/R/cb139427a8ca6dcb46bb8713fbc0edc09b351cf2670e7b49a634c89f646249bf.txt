# This code snippet is an example of using the R programming language to perform linear regression 

# Create a data frame with two columns, x and y, and corresponding numerical values 
my_data <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), y = c(3, 6, 10, 13, 17))

# Fit a linear regression model with x as the predictor and y as the response variable 
my_model <- lm(y ~ x, data = my_data)

# Print the summary of the model 
summary(my_model)

# Plot the data points and the regression line 
plot(my_data$x, my_data$y, main = "Linear Regression", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
abline(my_model, col = "red")
