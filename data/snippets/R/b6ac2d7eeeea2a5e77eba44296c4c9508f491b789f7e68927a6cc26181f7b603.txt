# This code snippet calculates the mean of two columns in a data frame
# The data frame is named "df" and the columns are "column1" and "column2"

# First, we select the two columns from the data frame using the select function from the dplyr package
selected_columns <- select(df, column1, column2)

# Then, we use the map_df function from the purrr package to iterate through each row and calculate the mean
mean_values <- map_df(selected_columns, ~rowMeans(.))

# Finally, we add the calculated mean values as a new column to the data frame
df$mean_column <- mean_values
