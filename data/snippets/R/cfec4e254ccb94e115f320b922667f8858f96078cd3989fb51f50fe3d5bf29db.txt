# This code snippet generates a histogram of random normal data with a given mean and standard deviation
# Define the mean and standard deviation
mean <- 0
sd <- 2
# Generate 1000 random normal data points with the given mean and standard deviation
data <- rnorm(1000, mean, sd)
# Create a histogram with 20 bins
