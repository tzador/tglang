# This is a function that calculates the mean of a given vector
# Input: vector of numerical values
# Output: mean value
mean_function <- function(vector) {
  n <- length(vector) # stores the length of the vector
  sum <- 0 # variable to track the sum of all values in the vector
  for (i in 1:n) { # loop through each element in the vector
    sum <- sum + vector[i] # add the current element to the sum
  }
  # calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the number of elements
  mean <- sum / n 
  return(mean) # return the calculated mean
}

# Sample usage of the mean_function
