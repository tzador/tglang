# This is a code snippet in R
# It creates a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of squares of those numbers
sum_of_squares <- function(list) {
  # Initialize a variable to hold the sum
  result <- 0 
  # Loop through the list and square each element, then add it to the sum variable
  for (i in list) {
    result <- result + i^2
  }
  # Return the final sum 
  return(result)
}
# Create a list of numbers to test the function
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# Call the function and store the result in a variable
sum <- sum_of_squares(numbers)
# Print the result
print(sum)
