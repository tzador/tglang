# This code uses a for loop to calculate the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 100
# First, we define a variable to store the sum
sum <- 0
# Then, we create a for loop that iterates from 1 to 100
for (i in 1:100) {
  # We use an if statement to check if the current number is odd
  if (i %% 2 == 1) {
    # If it is odd, we add it to the sum variable
    sum <- sum + i
  }
}
# Finally, we print the sum 
print(paste("The sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 100 is", sum))
