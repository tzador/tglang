# This is a function in R that calculates the factorial of a given integer
# Input: int (integer) - the number to be calculated
# Output: int (integer) - the factorial of the input number
factorial <- function(int) {
  # define a variable to store the factorial value
  result <- 1
  # use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to the input number
  for (i in 1:int) {
    # multiply the result variable by the current number in the loop
    result <- result * i
  }
  # return the final result
  return(result)
}

# example usage of the function
print(factorial(5))
# output: 120
