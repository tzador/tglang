# This code snippet calculates the sum of the first n terms in a geometric sequence.

# Initialize variables
a = 1  # first term
r = 2  # common ratio
n = 5  # number of terms

# Create vector of terms in sequence
terms = a * r^(0:(n-1))

# Calculate sum of terms using geometric series formula
sum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

# Print result
print(paste("The sum of the first", n, "terms in the geometric sequence is:", sum))

# Output:
# 
# The sum of the first 5 terms in the geometric sequence is: 31
