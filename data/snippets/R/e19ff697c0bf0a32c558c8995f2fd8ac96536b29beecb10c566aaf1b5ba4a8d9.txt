# This code snippet calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using a for loop
n <- 10 # change this value depending on the desired number of natural numbers
sum <- 0 # initialize sum variable
for (i in 1:n){ # for loop to iterate through the natural numbers from 1 to n
  sum <- sum + i # add current natural number to sum variable
}
print(sum) # print the final sum
