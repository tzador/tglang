# This is a code snippet that uses the "dplyr" package to filter a dataset and perform a linear regression analysis

# Load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# Read in the dataset from a csv file
data <- read.csv("dataset.csv")

# Filter the dataset to only include data from a specific year
filtered_data <- filter(data, year == 2020)

# Use the "lm" function to perform a linear regression analysis on the filtered dataset, with "y" as the dependent variable and "x" as the independent variable
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = filtered_data)

# Print the results of the linear regression analysis
summary(model)

# Create a scatterplot of the data, with "x" on the x-axis and "y" on the y-axis
plot(x ~ y, data = filtered_data)

# Add a trendline to the scatterplot using the "abline" function, with the coefficients from the linear regression model
abline(model$coefficients)

# Save the plot as a png file
png("scatterplot.png")

# Display the plot
plot(x ~ y, data = filtered_data)

# Save the image
