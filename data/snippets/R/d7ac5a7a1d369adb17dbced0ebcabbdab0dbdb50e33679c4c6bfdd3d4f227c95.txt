# This is a function that calculates the area of a circle
# It takes in the radius as a parameter and returns the area of the circle
circle_area <- function(radius){
    area = pi * radius^2  # Calculate the area using the formula pi * radius squared
    return(area)  # Return the calculated area
}

# Example usage
radius = 5
area = circle_area(radius)  # Calling the function and passing in the radius value
print(paste0("The area of a circle with radius ", radius, " is ", area))  # Printing the result
