# This code snippet creates a random matrix of numbers with user specified dimensions
# and calculates its determinant using the Cholesky decomposition method
# Import the 'Matrix' library for matrix operations
library(Matrix)

# Define the dimensions of the matrix
n <- 5   # number of rows
m <- 5   # number of columns

# Generate a random matrix with specified dimensions
A <- matrix(runif(n*m), ncol = m, nrow = n)

# Print the generated matrix
print(A)

# Calculate the Cholesky decomposition of the matrix
L <- Cholesky(A)

# Print the lower triangular matrix from the Cholesky decomposition
print(L@x)

# Calculate the determinant of the matrix using the Cholesky decomposition
# The determinant of a matrix is the product of the diagonal elements of its Cholesky decomposition
det <- prod(L@x)

# Print the determinant
print(det)
