# This code snippet creates a function that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2-dimensional space.

# Define the function with two parameters, p1 and p2, representing the coordinates of the two points.
euclidean_distance <- function(p1, p2) {

  # Calculate the squared differences between the x and y coordinates of the two points.
  x_diff <- (p1[1] - p2[1]) ** 2
  y_diff <- (p1[2] - p2[2]) ** 2

  # Calculate the sum of the squared differences.
  sum_diff <- x_diff + y_diff

  # Take the square root of the sum to get the Euclidean distance.
  distance <- sum_diff ** 0.5

  # Return the distance value.
  return(distance)
}

# Call the function with two points.
euclidean_distance(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))
