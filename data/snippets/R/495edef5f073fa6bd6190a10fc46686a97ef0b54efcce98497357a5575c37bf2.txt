# This code snippet creates a nested for loop to calculate the mean of a matrix
# First, define a matrix with random values
my_matrix <- matrix(rnorm(10), nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

# Define variables for storing total sum and number of values
total <- 0
count <- 0

# Create for loop to iterate through rows of matrix
for (i in 1:nrow(my_matrix)) {
    # Create nested for loop to iterate through columns
    for (j in 1:ncol(my_matrix)) {
        # Add matrix element to total sum and increase count by 1
        total <- total + my_matrix[i,j]
        count <- count + 1
    }
}

# Calculate mean by dividing total sum by count
mean <- total/count

# Print mean value
