# This code snippet calculates the mean of a list of numbers

# Define a function for calculating mean
mean_calculator <- function(numbers) {
  
  # Initialize a variable to store the sum of numbers
  total <- 0
  
  # Loop through the list of numbers
  for (num in numbers) {
    
    # Add each number to the total sum
    total <- total + num
  }
  
  # Calculate the mean by dividing the total sum by the number of numbers
  mean <- total/length(numbers)
  
  # Return the mean
  mean
}

# Create a list of numbers
numbers_list <- c(5, 7, 9, 2, 14, 6)

# Call the mean_calculator function and pass in the list of numbers
mean_calculator(numbers_list)

# Expected output: 7
