# This code snippet calculates the mean, median and mode of a data set
# Create a data set with random numbers
dataset <- rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 10)

# Calculate the mean
mean <- mean(dataset)

# Calculate the median
median <- median(dataset)

# Calculate the mode
library(modeest)
mode <- mfv(dataset)

# Print the results
print(paste0("The mean is: ", mean))
print(paste0("The median is: ", median))
print(paste0("The mode is: ", mode))
