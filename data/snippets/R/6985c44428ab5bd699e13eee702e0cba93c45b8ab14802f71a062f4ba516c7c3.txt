# Create a function that calculates the average of a given set of numbers
# Input: vector of numbers
# Output: average of the numbers
# Example: input = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), output = 3

# Define the function
average <- function(vector) {

  # Initialize a variable to store the sum of the numbers
  sum <- 0

  # Loop through the numbers in the vector
  for (num in vector) {

    # Add the current number to the sum variable
    sum <- sum + num
  }

  # Calculate the average by dividing sum by the length of the vector
  avg <- sum / length(vector)

  # Return the average
  return(avg)
}

# Call the function with an example input
average(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

# Output:
# 3
