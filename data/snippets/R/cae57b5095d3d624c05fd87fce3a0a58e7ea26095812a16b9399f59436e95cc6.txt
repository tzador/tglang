# This code snippet shows an example of a function that calculates the volume of a cube.

# 'cube_volume' function takes in one argument, 'length', and calculates the volume of the cube with that length
# by multiplying the length by itself three times.

cube_volume <- function(length) {
  return (length * length * length)
}

# Sample test cases
cube_volume(4) # should output 64
cube_volume(2.5) # should output 15.625
cube_volume(0) # should output 0

# We can also make use of variable assignment to store the result of the function in a variable for later use.

side_length <- 3
volume <- cube_volume(side_length) # will assign 27 to the variable 'volume'
