# This code snippet reads a CSV file, performs data manipulation and 
# generates a scatterplot with regression line.

# Importing libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Reading CSV file
data <- read_csv("file_name.csv")

# Data manipulation
data <- data %>%
  select(column1, column2) %>% # Selecting specific columns
  filter(column1 > 0, column2 != "") %>% # Filtering data
  mutate(column2 = factor(column2, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))) %>% # Converting column2 to a factor variable with specified levels
  group_by(column2) %>% # Grouping data by column2
  summarise(mean_column1 = mean(column1), median_column1 = median(column1)) # Summarizing data by taking mean and median of column1 for each level of column2

# Generating scatterplot with regression line
ggplot(data, aes(x = column1, y = column2)) + # Creating a scatterplot with column1 as x-axis and column2 as y-axis
  geom_point() + # Adding points to the scatterplot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") # Adding a regression line to the scatterplot using the lm method
