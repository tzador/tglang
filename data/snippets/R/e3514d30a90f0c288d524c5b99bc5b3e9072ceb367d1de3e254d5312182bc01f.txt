# This code snippet uses a for loop and conditional statements to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

# initialize variables 
n <- 10 # the number up to which we want to generate the sequence
fib <- c(0, 1) # initialize vector to store the sequence

# loop through numbers from 2 to n
for (i in 2:n) { 
  # check if previous two numbers are in the sequence
  if (i == 2) {  
    next_num <- 1
  } else {  
    next_num <- fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]
  }
  # add the next number to the sequence
  fib <- c(fib, next_num) 
}

# print the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number
print(fib)

# output: [1]  0  1  1  2  3  5  8 13 21 34 55
