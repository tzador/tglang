# Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial <- function(n) {
  # Initialize the result variable to 1
  result <- 1

  # Use a for loop to multiply each number from 1 to n
  for (i in 1:n) {
    result <- result * i # Update result with each iteration
  }

  # Return the final result
  return(result)
}

# Call the function with the input of 5 and store the output in a variable called answer
answer <- factorial(5)

# Print the output
print(answer)
