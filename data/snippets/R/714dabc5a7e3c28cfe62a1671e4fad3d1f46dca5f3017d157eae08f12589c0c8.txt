# This is a function that finds the average of a list of numbers
# Param: list- A list of numbers
# Output: Average of the numbers in the list

average <- function(list) {    # Define the function and set the parameter 
  sum = 0                       # Initialize a variable to hold the sum 
  for (num in list) {           # Loop through the list 
    sum = sum + num             # Add the current number to the sum 
  }
  avg = sum / length(list)      # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list 
  return(avg)                   # Return the average 
}

# Example usage of the function 
values <- c(3, 6, 9, 12)       # Define a list of numbers 
print(average(values))          # Call the function on the list and print the result 

# Output: 7.5
