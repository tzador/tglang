# This is a code snippet written in R.
# It creates a function that calculates the average of a row of numbers in a matrix.

# Define the function
calculate_average <- function(row) {
  
  # Calculate the total sum of the row
  total <- sum(row)
  
  # Count the number of elements in the row
  num_elements <- length(row)
  
  # Calculate the average by dividing the total sum by the number of elements
  average <- total / num_elements
  
  # Return the average
  return(average)
}

# Create a matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns
matrix <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12), nrow = 3, ncol = 4)

# Calculate the average of the second row using the newly created function
average <- calculate_average(matrix[2,])

# Print the result
print(average)
