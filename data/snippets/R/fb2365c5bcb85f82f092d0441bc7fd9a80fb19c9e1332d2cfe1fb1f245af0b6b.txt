# This code snippet generates a list of quadratic numbers from 1 to 10 in R
# Create a vector from 1 to 10
x <- 1:10
# Use lapply function to apply a function to each element of the vector
# The function calculates the square of each element
squares <- lapply(x, function(num) num*num)
# Print the list of quadratic numbers
print(squares)
