# This code snippet calculates and plots the running total of a user-specified vector
# First, we create a vector of random numbers with 10 elements
vector <- sample(100, 10)
# Next, we initialize a variable to hold the running total and set it to 0
running_total <- 0
# Then, we loop through each element of the vector and add it to the running total
for (i in vector) {
  running_total <- running_total + i
}
# Finally, we use the plot() function to plot the running total over the vector indices
plot(running_total, type = "l", xlab = "Index", ylab = "Running Total", main = "Running Total of Vector Elements")
