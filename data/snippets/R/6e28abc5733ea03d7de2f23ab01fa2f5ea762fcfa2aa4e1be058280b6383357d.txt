### Define a function to calculate the average score based on given grades
calculate_avg_score <- function(grades) {
    # First, we create a vector to store the numerical values of grades
    # using the switch function to convert letter grades to numbers.
    # If the grade is not recognized, we return NA.
    scores <- switch(grades,
                     "A" = 4,
                     "B" = 3,
                     "C" = 2,
                     "D" = 1,
                     "F" = 0,
                     NA)
    
    # Then, we filter out any NA values from the scores vector.
    # This is to ensure that only valid grades are included in the calculation.
    filtered_scores <- scores[!is.na(scores)]
    
    # Next, we calculate the average by summing up all the scores and dividing by the total number of grades.
    avg_score <- sum(filtered_scores) / length(filtered_scores)
    
    # Finally, we return the average score rounded to two decimal places.
    return(round(avg_score, 2))
}

# Example usage:
grades <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "F")
calculate_avg_score(grades)

# Output:
# 2.00
