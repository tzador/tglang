# This is a code snippet in R

# Declare a matrix
matrix <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

# Create a function to find the average of the matrix
find_average <- function(matrix){
  # Initialize variables
  sum <- 0
  count <- 0
  
  # Loop through each element in the matrix
  for (i in 1:nrow(matrix)){
    for (j in 1:ncol(matrix)){
      # Add current element to sum and increase count by 1
      sum <- sum + matrix[i,j]
      count <- count + 1
    }
  }
  
  # Calculate average
  average <- sum/count
  
  # Return average
  return(average)
}

# Call function and store output in a variable
avg <- find_average(matrix)

# Print average
print(avg)
