# This code snippet finds the coefficient estimates and standard errors of an ordinary linear regression model 
# as well as its adjusted R-squared value and corresponding p-value.

# Load the 'lmtest' and 'car' libraries for linear regression and model diagnostics respectively.
library(lmtest)
library(car)

# Create a data frame with the independent and dependent variables.
df <- data.frame(x = c(1,2,3,4,5), y = c(2,4,6,8,10))

# Fit a linear regression model with the dependent variable 'y' and independent variable 'x'.
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = df)

# Use the 'coef' function to find the coefficient estimates and print them out.
coefficients <- coef(model)
print(paste("Coefficient for x: ", coefficients[2]))
print(paste("Intercept: ", coefficients[1]))

# Use the 'vcov' function to find the variance-covariance matrix of the model.
cov_mat <- vcov(model)

# Extract the standard errors from the matrix and print them out.
print(paste("Standard error for coefficient of x: ", sqrt(cov_mat[2,2])))
print(paste("Standard error for intercept: ", sqrt(cov_mat[1,1])))

# Use the 'summary' function to get diagnostic information for the model, including the adjusted R-squared and p-value.
summary <- summary(model)
print(paste("Adjusted R-squared: ", summary$adj.r.squared))
print(paste("p-value: ", summary$p.value))

# Use the 'vif' function to find the variance inflation factors for the model, which indicate possible multicollinearity.
vifs <- vif(model)
print(paste("Variance inflation factors: ", vifs))
