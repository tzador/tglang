# This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
num <- 10               # Define the number of terms to be calculated
fib <- numeric(num)     # Create an empty vector to store the sequence

# Calculate the first two terms of the sequence
fib[1] <- 0             # Initialize the first term as 0
fib[2] <- 1             # Initialize the second term as 1

# Use a for loop to calculate the rest of the terms
for (i in 3:num) {      
    fib[i] <- fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]   # The next term is the sum of the previous two terms
}

# Print out the Fibonacci sequence
