# This code snippet uses the 'tidyverse' package in R to manipulate data frames and create visualizations

# Importing the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# Reading in a csv file as a data frame
df <- read_csv("data.csv")

# Filtering the data frame to include only rows where the 'age' column is greater than 30
df_filtered <- filter(df, age > 30)

# Grouping the data frame by the 'gender' column and calculating the mean value for the 'salary' column
df_grouped <- group_by(df_filtered, gender)
df_summary <- summarise(df_grouped, mean_salary = mean(salary))

# Creating a bar plot to visualize the mean salary by gender
ggplot(data = df_summary, aes(x = gender, y = mean_salary)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Mean Salary", title = "Mean Salary by Gender") +
