# Function to calculate the factorial of a number
# Takes in one parameter, n, which is the number to calculate the factorial for
factorial <- function(n) {
  # If n is 0 or 1, return 1
  if (n == 0 | n == 1) {
    return(1)
  }
  # If n is greater than 1, use recursion to calculate factorial 
  else {
  	# Initialize a variable to store the factorial
  	fact = 1
  	
  	# Loop from 1 to n, multiplying the current number by the previous factorial
  	for (i in 1:n) {
  	  fact = fact * i
  	}
  	
  	# Return the factorial
  	return(fact)
  }
}

# Call the factorial function and print the result
print(factorial(5))

# Output: 120
