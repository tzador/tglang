# This program uses a recursive function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number.

# Function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
fibonacci <- function(n) {
  if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
    return(1)
  }
  else {
    return(fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2))
  }
}

# Specify the number up to which the Fibonacci sequence should be calculated
n <- 10

# Loop through all numbers up to n and print the corresponding Fibonacci number
for (i in seq(n)) {
  print(paste("The Fibonacci number for", i, "is", fibonacci(i)))
}

# Output:
# The Fibonacci number for 1 is 1
# The Fibonacci number for 2 is 1
# The Fibonacci number for 3 is 2
# The Fibonacci number for 4 is 3
# The Fibonacci number for 5 is 5
# The Fibonacci number for 6 is 8
# The Fibonacci number for 7 is 13
# The Fibonacci number for 8 is 21
# The Fibonacci number for 9 is 34
# The Fibonacci number for 10 is 55
