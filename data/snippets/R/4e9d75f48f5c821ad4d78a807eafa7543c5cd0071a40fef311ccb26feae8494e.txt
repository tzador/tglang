# This code snippet calculates the sum of all the even numbers in a given range
# Initialize variables
lower <- 0  # Lower limit of range
upper <- 10 # Upper limit of range
sum <- 0    # Variable to store sum of even numbers
# Loop through range
for (i in lower:upper) {
  # Check if number is even
  if (i %% 2 == 0) {
    # Add even number to sum
    sum <- sum + i
  }
}
# Print sum of even numbers
print(sum)
