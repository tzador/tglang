# This is a code snippet in R that will calculate the minimum and maximum values of a given dataset and plot a histogram of the data.

# First, we will define our dataset as a vector of numbers called "data"
data <- c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30)

# Next, we will use the "range" function to find the minimum and maximum values of our dataset 
rangeValues <- range(data)

# We will store the minimum and maximum values in separate variables for easier access
minValue <- rangeValues[1]
maxValue <- rangeValues[2]

# We will also create a variable to store the number of bins we want for our histogram
numBins <- 5

# Now, we can use the "hist" function to plot a histogram of our dataset with the specified number of bins
hist(data, breaks = numBins)

# We can also add a title and labels to our histogram for better visualization
title(main = "Histogram of Data", xlab = "Values", ylab = "Frequency")

# Finally, we can print the minimum and maximum values on the histogram plot using the "abline" function
abline(v = minValue, col = "blue", lty = 2) # vertical line for minimum value
abline(v = maxValue, col = "red", lty = 2) # vertical line for maximum value
