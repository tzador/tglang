# This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.
# The function uses a for loop to iterate through the list and check if each number is even.
# If the number is even, it is added to a running total.
# The final total is then returned as the output of the function.

get_even_sum <- function(numbers) {
  # Initialize the running total as 0
  even_sum <- 0
  
  # Use a for loop to iterate through the list of numbers
  for (num in numbers) {
    # Check if the number is even by using the modulus operator (%)
    if (num %% 2 == 0) {
      # If the number is even, add it to the even_sum variable
      even_sum <- even_sum + num
    }
  }
  
  # Return the final even_sum as the output
  return(even_sum)
}

# Example usage: 
# Create a list of numbers
numbers <- c(2, 5, 10, 7, 12, 3, 8)

# Call the get_even_sum function with the list of numbers as an argument
get_even_sum(numbers)

# Output: 
# 32
