# This code snippet creates a matrix and performs a series of operations on it 
# to demonstrate usage of for loops, if statements, and while loops.

# Create a 5x5 matrix filled with random integers between 1 and 10
mat <- matrix(sample(1:10, 25, replace = TRUE), nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

# Print the matrix to the console
print(mat)

# Loop through the rows of the matrix
for (i in 1:nrow(mat)) {

  # Loop through the columns of the matrix
  for (j in 1:ncol(mat)) {

    # Check if the current element of the matrix is divisible by 2
    if (mat[i, j] %% 2 == 0) {

      # Multiply the element by 2
      mat[i, j] <- mat[i, j] * 2

    } else {

      # Divide the element by 2
      mat[i, j] <- mat[i, j] / 2

    }

  }

}

# Print the updated matrix to the console
print(mat)

# Create a vector to store the sum of each row of the matrix
sums <- vector(length = nrow(mat))

# Set counter variable to 1
count <- 1

# Loop through the rows of the matrix
while (count <= nrow(mat)) {

  # Add the sum of the current row to the vector
  sums[count] <- sum(mat[count, ])

  # Increment the counter
  count <- count + 1

}

# Print the vector of row sums to the console
print(sums)
