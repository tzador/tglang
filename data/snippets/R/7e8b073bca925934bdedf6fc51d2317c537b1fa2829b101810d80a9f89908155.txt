#
# This is a complex code snippet in R that calculates the mean and standard deviation of a given dataset.
#
# First, we need to define the dataset as a vector.
dataset <- c(17, 10, 23, 14, 19, 31, 28, 12, 4, 9)
# Next, we calculate the mean using the mean() function.
mean <- mean(dataset)
# We then calculate the sum of squares of the differences between each item in the dataset and the mean.
sum_of_squares <- sum((dataset-mean)^2)
# To get the variance, we divide the sum of squares by the total number of items in the dataset.
variance <- sum_of_squares/length(dataset)
# Finally, we get the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance.
# We use the round() function to round the value to two decimal places.
standard_deviation <- round(sqrt(variance), 2)
# We print the results to the console using the cat() function and string concatenation.
cat("The mean of the dataset is:", mean, "\nThe standard deviation is:", standard_deviation)
