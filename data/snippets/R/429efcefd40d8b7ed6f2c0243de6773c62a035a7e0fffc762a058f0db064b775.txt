# This is a complex code snippet in R
# It generates a list of random numbers and finds the mean

# Setting seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generating a list of 1000 random numbers between 0 and 1000
rand_nums <- sample(0:1000, 1000, replace = TRUE)

# Calculating the mean of the list
mean <- mean(rand_nums)

# Printing the mean value
print(paste("The mean of the list is", mean))

# Output: 
# The mean of the list is 515.581
