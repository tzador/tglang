### Creating a function to calculate the average of a list of numbers
avg <- function(list) {
  # Initializing variable to hold sum
  sum <- 0
  # Looping through the list to find sum
  for (num in list) {
    sum <- sum + num
  }
  # Calculating the average by dividing sum by length of list
  avg <- sum/length(list)
  # Returning the average value
  return(avg)
}
