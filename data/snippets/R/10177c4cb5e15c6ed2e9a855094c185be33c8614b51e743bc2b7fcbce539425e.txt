# This code snippet calculates the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers
# Create a list of numbers
numbers <- c(5, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 2, 4, 6, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5)

# Calculate the mean
mean <- sum(numbers)/length(numbers)

# Calculate the median
median <- median(numbers)

# Calculate the mode
# Create a function to count the frequency of numbers
