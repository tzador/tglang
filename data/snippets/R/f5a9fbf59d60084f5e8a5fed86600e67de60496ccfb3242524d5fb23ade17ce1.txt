# This is a function that calculates the factorial of a number
# It takes in an integer as its input and returns the factorial value
# First, we define the function using the "function" keyword
# The function is named "factorial" and takes in one parameter "num"
factorial <- function(num) {

    # We initialize the factorial value as 1
    # This will be multiplied with the numbers in a loop to get the factorial value
    fact_value <- 1

    # We use a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to the input number
    for (i in 1:num) {

        # We multiply the current factorial value with the current loop number
        # and store it back in the factorial value variable
        fact_value <- fact_value * i
    }

    # Lastly, we return the factorial value calculated
    return(fact_value)
