# This code snippet uses a for loop to calculate 
# the factorial of a given number n

# initialize variables
n <- 5 # number whose factorial is to be calculated
factorial <- 1 # initialize factorial variable to 1

# for loop to calculate factorial
for (i in 1:n){
  factorial <- factorial * i # multiply factorial by i every iteration
}

# print output
print(paste("Factorial of", n, "is", factorial))

# Output: 
# "Factorial of 5 is 120"
