# Function to calculate factorial of a number
# Parameters:
#   num: the number whose factorial is to be calculated
# Return value:
#   factorial: the calculated factorial of the number

factorial <- function(num) {
  # Initializing factorial to 1
  factorial <- 1

  # Loop from 1 to num, multiplying each number to factorial
  for (i in 1:num) {
    factorial <- factorial*i
  }

  return(factorial)
