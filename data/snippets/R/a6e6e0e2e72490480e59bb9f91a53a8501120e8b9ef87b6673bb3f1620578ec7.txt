# This code snippet demonstrates the use of the `merge()` function in R
# First, we create two data frames with a common column called `ID`
df1 <- data.frame(
  ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 
  var1 = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
)
df2 <- data.frame(
  ID = c(1, 4, 6, 7, 10), 
  var2 = c("F", "G", "H", "I", "J")
)
# Next, we use the `merge()` function to merge the two data frames based on their common column
merged_df <- merge(df1, df2, by = "ID")
# We can also specify the type of join we want to perform, in this case we use a left join
merged_df2 <- merge(df1, df2, by = "ID", all.x = TRUE)
# Finally, we can add additional arguments to the `merge()` function, such as adding suffixes to duplicated column names
merged_df3 <- merge(df1, df2, by = "ID", suffixes = c(".1", ".2"))
# Print the final merged data frame
merged_df3
