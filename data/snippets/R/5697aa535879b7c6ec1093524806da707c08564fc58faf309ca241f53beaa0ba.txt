# Import data from a CSV file

# Group the data by the column "age" and calculate the average value for each group
df_avg <- dplyr::group_by(df_female, age) %>% dplyr::summarize(avg_value = mean(value))
 
# Create a new column in the data frame called "above_avg" that indicates whether the "avg_value" is above the overall average for the dataset

# Display the first 10 rows of the final dataframe
