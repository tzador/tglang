# This code calculates the average of two numbers using a for loop
# and also checks for any negative numbers

# create a vector with two numbers
num <- c(10, -5)

# initialize a variable for the total sum
total_sum <- 0

# loop through the vector
for (i in 1:length(num)) {

  # check if the number is negative
  if (num[i] < 0) {

    # print error message
    print("Error: Negative numbers not allowed!")
    break # end the loop
  }

  # add the number to the total sum
  total_sum <- total_sum + num[i]
}

# calculate the average by dividing the total sum by the length of the vector
average <- total_sum / length(num)

# print the result
print(paste("The average of the two numbers is:", average))

# output:
# The average of the two numbers is: 5
