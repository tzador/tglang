# This is a function that takes in a vector of numbers and returns the sum of all the elements.
# First, we define the function with the name "sum_function" and a parameter "numbers".
sum_function <- function(numbers) {
    # Next, we initialize a variable "total" to hold the sum.
    total <- 0
    # Then, we use a for loop to iterate through each element in the vector.
    # Inside the loop, we add the current element to the "total" variable.
    for (num in numbers) {
        total <- total + num
    }
    # Finally, we return the calculated sum.
    return(total)
}
# We can now call the function and pass in a vector of numbers, in this case 1 to 5.
