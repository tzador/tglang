# This code snippet creates a function that performs polynomial regression on a given dataset and plots the results
# Input: x (vector of independent variables), y (vector of dependent variables), d (degree of polynomial)
# Output: plot of the polynomial regression line with the data points

polynomial_regression <- function(x, y, d) {
  # create a design matrix with powers of x up to d
  X <- poly(x, degree = d, raw = TRUE)
  
  # calculate coefficients for the polynomial regression
  coefficients <- solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y
  
  # create a vector of new x values for plotting
  x_new <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 100)
  
  # calculate predicted y values based on the polynomial regression
  y_pred <- cbind(rep(1, length(x_new)), poly(x_new, degree = d, raw = TRUE)) %*% coefficients
  
  # plot the data points
  plot(x, y)
  
  # add the polynomial regression line to the plot
  lines(x_new, y_pred, col = "red")
  
  # add title and axis labels to the plot
  title(main = "Polynomial Regression", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
  
  # add legend to the plot
