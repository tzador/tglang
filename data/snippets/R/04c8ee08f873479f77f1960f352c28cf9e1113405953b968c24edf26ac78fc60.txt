# Creates a for loop that iterates through a list and performs calculations on each element
# and returns a new list with the results

# Define a function with two parameters: list and calculation
forLoop <- function(list, calculation) {
  # Initialize an empty list to store results
  results <- list()

  # Use a for loop to iterate through the elements in the list
  for (element in list) {
    # Perform the specified calculation on each element and append the result to the results list
    results <- c(results, calculation(element))
  }

  # Return the results list
