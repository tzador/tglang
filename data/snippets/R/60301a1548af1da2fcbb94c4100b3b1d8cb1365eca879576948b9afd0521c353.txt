# This is a comment explaining the purpose of the code

# Creating a list of vectors
list_of_vectors <- list()

# Generating random numbers
for (i in 1:10) {
  list_of_vectors[[i]] <- runif(5)
}

# Defining a function to calculate the mean of each vector in the list
calculate_mean <- function(vector) {
  mean(vector)
}

# Applying the function to each vector in the list
mean_list <- lapply(list_of_vectors, calculate_mean)

# Creating a data frame from the list of means
mean_df <- data.frame(mean_list)

# Adding a new column indicating the vector number
mean_df$vector_number <- 1:10

# Renaming columns
colnames(mean_df) <- c("mean", "vector_number")

# Sorting the data frame by mean in descending order
mean_df <- mean_df[order(mean_df$mean, decreasing = TRUE),]

# Plotting the means in a bar graph
barplot(mean_df$mean, names.arg = mean_df$vector_number)
