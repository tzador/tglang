# This is a code snippet in R
# It demonstrates a for loop that calculates the factorial of a number

# Define a function for calculating the factorial
getFactorial <- function(x) {
  result <- 1 # initialize the result as 1
  for (i in 1:x) {
    result <- result * i # multiply the current result by the iteration number
  }
  return(result) # return the final factorial result
}

# Call the function and assign the output to a variable
num <- 5 # define the number for which we want to calculate the factorial
factorial <- getFactorial(num) # call the function and assign the output to a variable

print(factorial) # print the factorial result to the console

# Expected output: 120 (5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120)
