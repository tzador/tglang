# This is a code snippet in R that uses dataframes, loops, and functions to calculate the average age of a group of people

# Create a dataframe with information about each person in the group
person_df <- data.frame(
  names = c("John", "Mary", "Alex", "Emma", "Jake"),
  age = c(25, 30, 21, 27, 35),
  gender = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Male"),
  occupation = c("Teacher", "Lawyer", "Engineer", "Doctor", "Writer")
)

# Create a function to calculate the average age
calculate_avg_age <- function(df) {
  # Initialize a variable to store the total age
  total_age <- 0
  
  # Loop through the age column of the dataframe and add each age to the total age
  for (age in df$age) {
    total_age <- total_age + age
  }
  
  # Calculate the average age by dividing the total age by the number of people in the group
  avg_age <- total_age / nrow(df)
  
  # Return the average age
  return(avg_age)
}

# Call the function on our person dataframe and assign the result to a variable
avg_age <- calculate_avg_age(person_df)

# Print the average age with a message
print(paste("The average age of the group is:", avg_age, "years old"))
