# This code snippet generates a function that takes in three parameters and calculates the sum of squares of all integers between the first two parameters, while excluding any number divisible by the third parameter.
# The function also prints the total number of integers included in the calculation and the final sum of squares.

sum_of_squares <- function(start, end, divisor) {
  #initialize sum and count variables
  sum <- 0
  count <- 0
  
  #loop through all the numbers between start and end
  for (i in start:end) {
    #check if number is divisible by divisor
    if (i %% divisor == 0) {
      #if divisible, skip number
      next
    } else {
      #if not divisible, add square of number to sum
      sum <- sum + i^2
      #increment count
      count <- count + 1
    }
  }
  
  #print total count and final sum
  print(paste("Total count:", count))
  print(paste("Final sum:", sum))
