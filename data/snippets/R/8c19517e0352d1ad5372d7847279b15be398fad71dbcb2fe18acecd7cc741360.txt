# This code snippet generates a random matrix and performs matrix multiplication on it
# First, we generate a 5x5 matrix with random numbers ranging from 1 to 10
matrix1 <- matrix(data = sample(10, 25, replace = TRUE), nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

# Next, we generate a 5x3 matrix with random numbers ranging from 1 to 10
matrix2 <- matrix(data = sample(10, 15, replace = TRUE), nrow = 5, ncol = 3)

# Then, we print out the two matrices
print("Matrix 1:")
print(matrix1)
print("Matrix 2:")
print(matrix2)

# Now, we perform matrix multiplication on the two matrices using the %*% operator
product <- matrix1 %*% matrix2

# Finally, we print the resulting matrix
print("Result:")
print(product)
