#This code snippet calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100

#Create a vector with numbers from 1 to 100
numbers <- 1:100

#Create a vector to store the even numbers
even_numbers <- c()

#Loop through the numbers vector and check if each number is even
for (i in numbers) {
  if (i %% 2 == 0) { #If the number is even, add it to the even_numbers vector
    even_numbers <- c(even_numbers, i)
  }
}

#Calculate the sum of the even_numbers vector using the sum() function
result <- sum(even_numbers)

#Print the result
print(result)
