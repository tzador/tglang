# This is a code snippet in R
# It creates a data frame with different types of data and performs some operations on the data
# Define variables
x <- c(1,2,3,4)
y <- c("a","b","c","d")
z <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
w <- c("HELLO", "world")
# Create a data frame with the variables
df <- data.frame(x, y, z, w)
# Print the data frame
df
# Subset the data frame to only keep columns where the variable values are greater than 2
df_subset <- df[df$x > 2, ]
# Replace the second column with the string "new" 
df_subset[,2] <- "new"
# Add a new column with the values from 1 to 3
df_subset$new_column <- 1:3
# Rename the columns of the data frame
colnames(df_subset) <- c("x_new", "y_new", "z_new", "w_new")
# Calculate the mean of the numerical columns
mean_x <- mean(df_subset$x_new)
mean_z <- mean(df_subset$z_new)
# Print the means
cat("The mean of column x is", mean_x)
cat("The mean of column z is", mean_z)
