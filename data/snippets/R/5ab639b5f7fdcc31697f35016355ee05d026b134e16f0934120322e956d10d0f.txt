# This is a function that takes in two arguments, n (a positive integer) and words (a vector of strings)
# It randomly selects n words from the vector and prints them out in a sentence

word_selector <- function(n, words){
  # First, create an empty vector to hold the selected words
  selected_words <- c()
  
  # Use a for loop to randomly select n words and add them to the vector
  for (i in 1:n) {
    # Generate a random index to select a word from the vector
    rand_index <- sample(length(words), 1)
    # Add the randomly selected word to the vector
    selected_words <- c(selected_words, words[rand_index])
  }
  
  # Use the paste function to combine the selected words into a sentence
  sentence <- paste(selected_words, collapse = " ")
  
  # Print out the sentence using the cat function
  cat("Here are", n, "randomly selected words:", sentence)
}

# Example usage:
word_list <- c("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "mango")
word_selector(3, word_list)

# Output:
# Here are 3 randomly selected words: apple orange grape
