# Create a function to calculate the standard deviation of a numeric vector
# x is the input vector
# Returns the standard deviation of the vector

calculate_sd <- function(x) {
  # Calculate the mean of the vector
  x_mean <- mean(x)
  # Calculate the sum of squared differences of each element from the mean
  sum_sq_diff <- sum((x - x_mean)^2)
  # Calculate the number of elements in the vector
  n <- length(x)
  # Calculate the standard deviation by dividing the sum of squared differences by (n-1) and taking the square root
  sd <- sqrt(sum_sq_diff / (n-1))
  # Return the calculated standard deviation
  return(sd)
}

# Example usage - calculate the standard deviation of a vector with 10 random numbers between 1 and 100
vector <- sample(1:100, 10)
calculate_sd(vector)

# Output:
# [1] 36.71284
