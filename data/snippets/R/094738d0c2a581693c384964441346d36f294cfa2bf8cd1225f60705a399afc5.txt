# This is a function that calculates the mean and standard deviation of a given vector

# Define a function called "mean_sd"
mean_sd <- function(vector){
    # Calculate the mean of the vector
    mean <- mean(vector)
    
    # Calculate the standard deviation of the vector
    standard_dev <- sd(vector)
    
    # Return a list containing the mean and standard deviation
    return(list("mean"=mean, "standard_dev"=standard_dev))
}

# Define a vector to test the function on
test_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Call the "mean_sd" function on the test vector
results <- mean_sd(test_vector)

# Print the results
print(results)

# Output:
