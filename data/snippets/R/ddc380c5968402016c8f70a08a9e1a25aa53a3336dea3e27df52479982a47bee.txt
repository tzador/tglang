# This code snippet calculates the mean and standard deviation of a given dataset and plots it in a histogram

# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv("data.csv")

# Calculate the mean
mean <- mean(data)

# Calculate the standard deviation
sd <- sd(data)

# Plot a histogram with the mean and standard deviation annotated on the plot
hist(data, main = "Data Histogram", xlab = "Data", ylim = c(0, 10), xlim = c(0, 100))
abline(v = mean, lty = 2, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
text(mean, 9, "Mean", col = "blue")
abline(v = sd, lty = 3, col = "red", lwd = 2)
text(sd + 1, 9, "Standard Deviation", col = "red")

# Save the histogram plot as a PNG file
png("histogram.png")

# Close the PNG device
