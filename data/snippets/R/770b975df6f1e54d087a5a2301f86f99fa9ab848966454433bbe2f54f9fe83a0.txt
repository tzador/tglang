## create a function to calculate the mean of a given vector
mean_function = function(x){
  ## initialize the sum to zero
  sum = 0
  ## iterate through each element in the vector
  for (i in 1:length(x)){
    ## add each element to the sum
    sum = sum + x[i]
  }
  ## calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the length of the vector
  mean = sum/length(x)
  ## return the mean
  return(mean)
}

## create a vector of numbers
vector <- 1:10

## call the mean_function on the vector
mean_result = mean_function(vector)

## print the result
print(mean_result)
