# This code snippet generates a random matrix and performs principal component analysis (PCA) on it.

# Generate a 10x10 matrix with random numbers from a normal distribution
matrix <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow=10, ncol=10)

# Scale the matrix by standardization
scaled_matrix <- scale(matrix)

# Perform PCA on the scaled matrix
pca <- prcomp(scaled_matrix)

# Print the variance explained by each principal component
print(pca$sdev^2)

# Plot the first two principal components against each other
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], xlab="PC1", ylab="PC2", main="Principal Component Analysis")

# Add a legend to the plot
legend("bottomright", legend=c("PC1", "PC2"), col=c("red", "blue"), pch=1)
