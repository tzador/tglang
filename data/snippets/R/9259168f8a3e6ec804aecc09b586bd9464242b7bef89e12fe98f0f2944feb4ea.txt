# This is a complex code snippet in R

# Creating a matrix with numbers from 1 to 10
matrix <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 5)

# Printing the matrix
print(matrix)

# Creating a new vector with even numbers from 2 to 10
even_numbers <- seq(from = 2, to = 10, by = 2)

# Printing the vector
print(even_numbers)

# Calculating the mean of the even numbers
mean <- mean(even_numbers)

# Printing the mean
print(mean)

# Creating a new data frame with columns for numbers, their squares, and their cubes
data_frame <- data.frame(numbers = 1:10, squares = (1:10)^2, cubes = (1:10)^3)

# Printing the data frame
print(data_frame)

# Generating a scatter plot of the squares and cubes
plot(data_frame$squares, data_frame$cubes, col = "blue", main = "Squares vs Cubes", xlab = "Squares", ylab = "Cubes")

# Adding a line of best fit to the scatter plot
abline(lm(data_frame$cubes ~ data_frame$squares))
