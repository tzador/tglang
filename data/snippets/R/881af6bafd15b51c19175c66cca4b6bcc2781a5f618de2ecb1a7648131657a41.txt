# This code snippet uses the built-in iris dataset to train and test a random forest model
# Import the dataset
dataset <- iris
# Split the dataset into training and test sets
train <- dataset[1:100,]
test <- dataset[101:150,]
# Train the model
model <- randomForest(Species ~ ., data = train)
# Make predictions on the test set
predictions <- predict(model, test)
# Calculate accuracy
accuracy <- mean(predictions == test$Species)
# Print the accuracy
cat("Accuracy:", accuracy)
