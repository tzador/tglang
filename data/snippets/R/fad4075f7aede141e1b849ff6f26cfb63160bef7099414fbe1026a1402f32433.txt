# This code snippet creates a function for calculating the factorial of a number

# Define the function
fact <- function(n) {

# Initialize factorial variable
  factorial <- 1
  
# Create for loop to iterate through all numbers less than or equal to n
  for (i in 1:n) {
    
# Multiply factorial by current value of i
    factorial <- factorial * i
  }
  
# Return factorial value
  return(factorial)
}

# Call the function and pass in a value for n
n <- 5
factorial_n <- fact(n)

# Print the result of the factorial calculation
print(factorial_n)
