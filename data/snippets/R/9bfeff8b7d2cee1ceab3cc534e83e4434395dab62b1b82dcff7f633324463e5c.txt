# This code snippet is a function that generates a list of Fibonacci numbers.
# It takes in two parameters, n and sort, where n is the number of Fibonacci numbers to be generated and sort is a logical value indicating whether to sort the list in ascending or descending order.
# It returns a list of Fibonacci numbers based on the given parameters.

fibonacci <- function(n, sort = TRUE) {

    # Initializing the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
    numbers <- c(0, 1)

    # Checking if the input for n is valid
    if (n < 1) {
        stop("n must be greater than or equal to 1")
    }

    # Calculating the remaining Fibonacci numbers and adding them to the list
    for (i in 3:n) {
        numbers[i] <- numbers[i-1] + numbers[i-2]
    }

    # Sorting the list if sort is set to TRUE
    if (sort) {
        numbers <- sort(numbers)
    }

    # Returning the list of Fibonacci numbers
    return(numbers)
}

# Calling the function to generate a list of 10 Fibonacci numbers in descending order
fibonacci(10, sort = FALSE)
