# This code snippet calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables
# First, we define the two variables x and y
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
y <- c(10,7,3,5,9)

# Next, we calculate the mean of x and y
x_mean <- mean(x)
y_mean <- mean(y)

# Then, we calculate the differences between each variable and its mean
x_diff <- x - x_mean
y_diff <- y - y_mean

# After that, we calculate the product of the two differences
xy_product <- x_diff * y_diff

# Next, we calculate the sum of squares for both variables
x_ss <- sum(x_diff^2)
y_ss <- sum(y_diff^2)

# Finally, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient using the formula
r <- sum(xy_product) / sqrt(x_ss * y_ss)

# Print the result
print(paste("The Pearson correlation coefficient between x and y is: ", r))
