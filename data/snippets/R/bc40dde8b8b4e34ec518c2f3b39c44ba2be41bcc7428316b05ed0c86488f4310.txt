# This code snippet calculates the mean and standard deviation of a vector with 1000 random integers between 1 and 100.
# First, we set the seed for reproducibility.
set.seed(123)
# Next, we generate the vector with 1000 random integers.
x <- sample(1:100, 1000, replace = TRUE)
# Calculate the mean of the vector.
mean_x <- mean(x)
# Calculate the standard deviation of the vector.
sd_x <- sd(x)
# Print the results.
print("The mean of the vector is:")
print(mean_x)
print("The standard deviation of the vector is:")
print(sd_x)
