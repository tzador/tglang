# This code snippet demonstrates how to perform nonparametric regression using the loess function in R

# Load the loess package
library(loess)

# Generate a dataset with a nonlinear relationship between x and y
x <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)
y <- 2*sin(x) + rnorm(length(x))

# Calculate a nonparametric regression using loess
loess_fit <- loess(y ~ x)

# Plot the original data and the loess fit
plot(x, y, xlab = "x", ylab = "y", main = "Nonparametric Regression with loess")
lines(x, predict(loess_fit), col = "red")

# Add a confidence interval to the plot
lines(x, predict(loess_fit, se = TRUE), col = "blue", lty = 2)
lines(x, predict(loess_fit, se = TRUE), col = "blue", lty = 2)
lines(x, predict(loess_fit, lower = TRUE), col = "green", lty = 2)
lines(x, predict(loess_fit, upper = TRUE), col = "green", lty = 2)

# Add a legend to the plot
legend("topleft", legend = c("Original data", "Loess fit", "Confidence interval"), col = c("black", "red", "blue"), lty = c(1, 1, 2), bty = "n")
