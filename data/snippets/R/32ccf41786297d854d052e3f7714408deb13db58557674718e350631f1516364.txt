# Assigning a vector of numbers from 1 to 10 to a variable
my_vector <- c(1:10)

# Defining a function that takes in a vector of numbers and returns the mean
my_function <- function(numbers) {
  mean(numbers)
}

#Calling the function on our assigned vector and storing the result in a variable
my_mean <- my_function(my_vector)

#printing the result
print(my_mean)
