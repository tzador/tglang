# This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

fact <- function(x) { # Defining a function named 'fact' with a parameter 'x'
  if (x == 0) { # Checking if the value of 'x' is equal to 0
    return(1) # If so, then return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
  }
  else { # If 'x' is not equal to 0
    result <- 1 # Initialize a variable 'result' to 1
    for (i in 1:x) { # Loop through the values from 1 to 'x'
      result <- result * i # Multiply 'result' with 'i' at each iteration
    }
    return(result) # Return the final value of 'result' as the factorial of 'x'
  }
}

fact(5) # Calling the function with a value of 5 to calculate its factorial

# Output: 120  (factorial of 5 is 120)
