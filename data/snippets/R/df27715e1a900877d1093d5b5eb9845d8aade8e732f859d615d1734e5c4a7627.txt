# This function calculates the mean of a vector
# Inputs:
#     x: a numeric vector
# Output:
#     mean: the mean of the input vector

mean <- function(x) {
    n <- length(x)  # get the length of input vector
    sum <- 0  # initialize sum variable

    for (i in 1:n) {  # loop through each element in the vector
        sum <- sum + x[i]  # add the element to the sum
    }

    mean <- sum/n  # divide the sum by the length to get the mean
    return(mean)  # return the mean
}

# example usage of the function
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(x)

# Output:
# 3  # the mean of vector x
