## sorting function
  #This function uses bubble sort algorithm to sort a vector of numbers in ascending order.
  
  BubbleSort <- function(x) {
    #initialize a variable to track swaps and set it to 1
    swaps <- 1 
    #set a loop to continue until no more swaps are made
    while (swaps > 0) {
      #set swap tracker variable to 0
      swaps <- 0 
      #set a for loop to compare neighboring elements in vector
      for (i in 1:(length(x)-1)) { 
        #if element at i is greater than element at i+1, swap them
        if (x[i] > x[i+1]) { 
          temp <- x[i] 
          x[i] <- x[i+1] 
          x[i+1] <- temp
