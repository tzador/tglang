# This is a code snippet in R that generates a random matrix and performs matrix multiplication on it
# First we set the dimensions of the matrix
m = 5 # number of rows
n = 3 # number of columns

# Next we generate the random matrix using the rnorm function, which creates a matrix of random numbers from a normal distribution
matrix1 = matrix(rnorm(m*n), ncol=n)

# Now we generate a second random matrix with the same dimensions
matrix2 = matrix(rnorm(m*n), ncol=n)

# We can now perform matrix multiplication using the %*% operator
result = matrix1 %*% matrix2

# Finally, we print the result
print(result)
