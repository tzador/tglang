# Declaring a function to calculate the variance of a vector
# vector: A numeric vector
# Returns the variance of the vector
variance <- function(vector) {
    mean_squared <- mean(vector) ^ 2 # Calculating the squared mean
    squared_mean <- mean(vector ^ 2) # Calculating the mean of squared values

}

# Generating a random vector

# Calculating the variance of the vector using the function
