# This is a code snippet in R that utilizes nested for loops to sort a list in ascending order

# Define a list of numbers to be sorted
nums <- c(5, 2, 7, 1, 3)

# Use a for loop to iterate through the list
for (i in 1:length(nums)){

  # Create a variable to keep track of whether the list is already sorted
  sorted <- TRUE

  # Use a nested for loop to compare each number to the next and swap if necessary
  for (j in 1:(length(nums)-i)){

    # If the current number is larger than the next number, swap them
    if (nums[j] > nums[j+1]){
      tmp <- nums[j+1]
      nums[j+1] <- nums[j]
      nums[j] <- tmp

      # Set sorted to FALSE to indicate that a swap was made
      sorted <- FALSE
    }
  }

  # If sorted remains TRUE, break out of the loop as the list is already sorted
  if (sorted){
    break
  }
}

# Print the sorted list
print(nums)
