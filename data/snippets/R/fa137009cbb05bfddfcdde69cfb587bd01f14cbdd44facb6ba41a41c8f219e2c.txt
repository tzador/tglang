# Define a function that takes in a vector of numbers and returns the sum of its elements

  # Initialize a variable to store the sum
  total <- 0
  # Loop through the elements of the vector
  for (element in vector) {
    # Add the element to the total
    total <- total + element

  # Return the total sum

# Create a vector of numbers
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# Call the sum_vector function and store the result in a variable
result <- sum_vector(numbers)
# Print the result

# Output: 15
