# This R code snippet demonstrates how to create and manipulate a data frame using the "tidyr" and "dplyr" packages 
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

# Create a data frame with 5 columns and 10 rows
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("John", "Jane", "James", "Emily", "Michael", "Sophia", "William", "Isabella", "Alexander", "Abigail"),
  age = c(25, 32, 41, 19, 28, 36, 47, 23, 30, 39),
  height = c(5.6, 5.9, 5.4, 6.2, 5.8, 5.5, 6.1, 5.7, 6.0, 5.3),
  gender = c("M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "F", "M"),
  city = c("New York", "Chicago", "Los Angeles", "Boston", "Atlanta", "Houston", "San Francisco", "Seattle", "Miami", "Dallas"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Use the "tidyr" package to gather the data frame into a long format
df_long <- df %>% gather(key = "variable", value = "value", -name)

# Use the "dplyr" package to filter the data frame based on the age and gender variables
df_filtered <- df_long %>% filter(age > 30, gender == "F")

# Create a new column in the filtered data frame that calculates the average height
df_filtered <- df_filtered %>% mutate(avg_height = (height + value) / 2)

# Use the "dplyr" package to group the filtered data frame by city and calculate the mean age and average height for each group
df_grouped <- df_filtered %>% 
  group_by(city) %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age), mean_height = mean(avg_height))

# Use the "tidyr" package to spread the grouped data frame back into a wide format
df_wide <- df_grouped %>% spread(key = city, value = mean_age)

# Print the final wide data frame
df_wide
