# This code snippet creates a function called `calculate_mean` that takes in a vector of numbers as input and returns the mean of those numbers after removing any outliers

calculate_mean <- function(numbers) {
  # Remove outliers by finding the upper and lower quartiles
  Q1 <- quantile(numbers, 0.25)
  Q3 <- quantile(numbers, 0.75)
  # Calculate the interquartile range
  IQR <- Q3-Q1
  # Remove any numbers that fall outside of 1.5 times the IQR from the median
  numbers <- numbers[numbers >= Q1-1.5*IQR & numbers <= Q3+1.5*IQR]
  # Calculate the mean of the remaining numbers
  mean(numbers)
}
