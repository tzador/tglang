# This code snippet creates a function that calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
fib <- function(n) {
  # set the first and second terms
  first <- 0
  second <- 1
  # create a for loop that iterates from 2 to n
  for (i in 2:n) {
    # calculate the nth term by adding the previous two terms
    nth_term <- first + second
    # update the first and second terms
    first <- second
    second <- nth_term
  }
  # return the nth term
  return(nth_term)
}

# call the function and store the result
result <- fib(7)

# print the result
print(result)
