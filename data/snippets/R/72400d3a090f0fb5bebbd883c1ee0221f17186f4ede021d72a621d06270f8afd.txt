# Define a function to calculate the fibonacci sequence up to a given number

    # Create a vector with the first two values of the sequence
    sequence <- c(0, 1)

    # Use a for loop to iterate through all numbers up to n-2
    for(i in 1:(n-2)) {
        # Calculate the next value in the sequence by summing the last two values
        next <- sequence[i] + sequence[i+1]

# Output:
