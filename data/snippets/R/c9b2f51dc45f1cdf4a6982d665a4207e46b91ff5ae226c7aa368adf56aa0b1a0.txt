# Function to calculate the sample variance and standard deviation
# Based on the formula: s^2 = (1/(n-1)) * sum((x_i - x_bar)^2)
# Input parameters:
#   values: A vector of numeric values
# Output:
#   A named list containing sample variance and standard deviation
calc_var_sd <- function(values) {
  # Calculate sample mean
  x_bar <- mean(values)
  # Calculate differences between each value and the mean
  diff_x <- values - x_bar
  # Square each difference
  diff_sq <- diff_x^2
  # Calculate the sum of squared differences
  sum_diff_sq <- sum(diff_sq)
  # Calculate the sample variance
  var <- (1 / (length(values) - 1)) * sum_diff_sq
  # Calculate the sample standard deviation
  sd <- sqrt(var)
  # Create a named list to store the results
  results <- list("variance" = var, "standard_deviation" = sd)
  # Return the results
  return(results)
