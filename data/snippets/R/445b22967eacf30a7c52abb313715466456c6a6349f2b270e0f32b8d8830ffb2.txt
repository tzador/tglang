# This code snippet creates a function that calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci <- function(n) {
  if(n == 1 || n == 2) {          # base case: first two numbers in sequence are 1
    return(1)
  } else {                        # recursive case: call function twice to calculate next number
    a <- fibonacci(n-1)           # calculate previous number in sequence
    b <- fibonacci(n-2)           # calculate two numbers before
    return(a + b)                 # add values together to get nth number
  }
}

# Sample usage of the function:
fibonacci(6) # this will return the 6th number in the Fibonacci sequence, which is 8
