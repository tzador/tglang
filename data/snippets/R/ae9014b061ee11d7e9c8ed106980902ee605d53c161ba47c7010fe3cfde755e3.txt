# Create a function that calculates the average of a list
average <- function(lst) {
  total <- 0  # initialize total variable
  for (num in lst) {
      total <- total + num # add each number in the list to total
  }
  avg <- total/length(lst)  # divide total by number of elements in list to get average
  return(avg)  # return average as output
}

# Sample usage with a list of numbers
my_list <- list(4, 8, 12, 16)
average(my_list)  # output: 10
