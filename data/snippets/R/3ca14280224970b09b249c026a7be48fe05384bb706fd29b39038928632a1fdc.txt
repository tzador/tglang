# This code snippet creates a function that takes in two vectors as input and returns the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two vectors.

# Create function named "pearson_corr" with two parameters, "vec1" and "vec2"
pearson_corr <- function(vec1, vec2) {

  # Calculate the mean of the first vector
  vec1_mean <- mean(vec1)

  # Calculate the mean of the second vector
  vec2_mean <- mean(vec2)

  # Calculate the standard deviation of the first vector
  vec1_sd <- sd(vec1)

  # Calculate the standard deviation of the second vector
  vec2_sd <- sd(vec2)

  # Calculate the sum of the products of the differences between each value in the two vectors and their respective means
  sum_prod_diff <- sum((vec1-vec1_mean) * (vec2-vec2_mean))

  # Calculate the squared sum of the differences between each value in the first vector and its mean
  sum_diff_sq1 <- sum((vec1-vec1_mean)^2)

  # Calculate the squared sum of the differences between each value in the second vector and its mean
  sum_diff_sq2 <- sum((vec2-vec2_mean)^2)

  # Calculate the denominator of the Pearson correlation coefficient formula
  denominator <- sqrt(sum_diff_sq1) * sqrt(sum_diff_sq2)

  # Calculate the numerator of the Pearson correlation coefficient formula
  numerator <- sum_prod_diff

  # Calculate the final Pearson correlation coefficient
  pearson_corr <- numerator / denominator

  # Return the Pearson correlation coefficient
  return(pearson_corr)
}

# Call the "pearson_corr" function with two example vectors
pearson_corr(c(1,2,3,4,5), c(2,4,6,8,10))
