# This is a code snippet in R that uses a for loop to calculate the power of numbers from 1 to 10
# First, we define a function called 'power'
power <- function(num) {
    # We first set the initial value of the result to 1
    result <- 1
    # Then we use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10
    for (i in 1:10) {
        # Within the loop, we multiply the current result by the number
        result <- result * num
    }
    # Finally, we return the resulting value of the power calculation
    return(result)
}

# Now we can call the power function and pass in a number to calculate the power of
power(3)

# Output: 
# The output of this code snippet would be 59049, as it calculates the power of 3 to the 10th power.
