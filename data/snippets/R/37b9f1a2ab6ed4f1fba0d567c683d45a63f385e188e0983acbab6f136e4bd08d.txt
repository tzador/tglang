# This is a complex code snippet written in R
# It includes various functions and loops to generate a set of random numbers
# and calculate their standard deviation and mean
# The snippet also includes annotation to guide the user

# Import the necessary libraries

library(stats) # library for statistical functions
library(gtools) # library for generating random numbers

# Set the number of random numbers to be generated
 
num <- 100 

# Create empty vector

rand_nums <- numeric(num)

# Use for loop to generate random numbers and append to vector

for (i in 1:num) {
  rand_nums[i] <- runif(1, min = 0, max = 100) # generates random number between 0 and 100
}

# Calculate the mean of the generated numbers

mean <- mean(rand_nums)

# Calculate the standard deviation of the generated numbers

stdev <- sd(rand_nums)

# Print the mean and standard deviation

print(paste0("The mean of the generated numbers is ", mean))
print(paste0("The standard deviation of the generated numbers is ", stdev))

# Output:
