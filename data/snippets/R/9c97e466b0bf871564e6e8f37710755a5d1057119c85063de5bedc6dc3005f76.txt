# This is a code snippet in R that creates a simple linear regression model
# Dataset consists of two numeric variables, x and y
# Model is used to predict y based on x
# The model is then plotted with the data points

#Loading the required library for creating the model
library(stats)

#Generating the data for x and y
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
y <- c(5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23)

#Creating the linear regression model
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = data.frame(x = x, y = y))

#Plotting the data points
plot(x, y, main = "Linear Regression Model", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")

#Adding a line for the model predictions
abline(model, col = "blue")

#Adding legend for the data points and model line
legend("topleft", legend = c("Data points", "Model"), col = c("black", "blue"), lty = c(0, 1), pch = c(1, NA))

#Output: The graph shows a linear regression line that best fits the data points and can be used to predict y based on x.
