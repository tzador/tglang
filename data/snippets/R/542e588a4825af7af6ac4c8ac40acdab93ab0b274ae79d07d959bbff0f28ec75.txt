# This code snippet creates a function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number

# Define the function with the parameter 'n'
fibonacci <- function(n) {
  
  # Assign the first two numbers in the sequence to variables a and b
  a <- 1
  b <- 1
  
  # Use a for loop to iterate through the sequence up to n-2
  for (i in 3:n) {
    
    # Use the sum of the previous two numbers to calculate the next number in the sequence
    c <- a + b
    
    # Assign the value of b to a and the value of c to b for the next iteration
    a <- b
    b <- c
  }
  
  # Return the n-th number in the sequence
  return(b)
}

# Call the function with an input value of 10
fibonacci(10)

# Output: 
55
