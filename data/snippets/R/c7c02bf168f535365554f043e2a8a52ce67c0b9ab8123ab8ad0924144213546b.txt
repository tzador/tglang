#This is a randomly generated code snippet in R that creates a list of 50 individuals with a random age between 20 and 60, calculates their average age, and prints it out
#Create a vector of 50 random ages using the sample() function and specify the range of 20 to 60
ages <- sample(20:60, 50, replace = TRUE)

#Use the mean() function to calculate the average age from the vector and assign it to a variable called "avg_age"
avg_age <- mean(ages)

#Print out the average age using the sprintf() function to format it to two decimal places
sprintf("The average age is %.2f", avg_age)
