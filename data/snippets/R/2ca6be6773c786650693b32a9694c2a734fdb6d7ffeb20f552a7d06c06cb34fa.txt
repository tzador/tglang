# This code snippet calculates the mean of a given dataset and plots a histogram

# Input dataset
data <- c(58, 37, 84, 65, 72, 44, 90, 62, 51, 81, 62, 78, 75, 69, 71)

# Calculate the mean
mean <- mean(data)

# Plot a histogram with the mean as a vertical line
hist(data, main = "Histogram of Dataset", xlab = "Value", ylab = "Frequency", col = "skyblue2")
abline(v = mean, lwd = 2, lty = "dashed", col = "red")
