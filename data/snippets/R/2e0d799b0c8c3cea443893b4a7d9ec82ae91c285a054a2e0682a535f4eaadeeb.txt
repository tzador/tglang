# This code snippet generates and visualizes a scatter plot of two variables, along with a regression line and confidence bands.
# It requires the 'ggplot2' and 'dplyr' packages to be installed.

# Load the necessary packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Create a data frame with two variables, one of which is normally distributed and the other is randomly generated
df <- data.frame(
  Normal_Variable = rnorm(100),
  Random_Variable = runif(100)
)

# Create a scatter plot, with Normal_Variable as the x-axis and Random_Variable as the y-axis
scatter_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Normal_Variable, y = Random_Variable)) +
  geom_point() + # add points to the plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) + # fit a regression line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE, color = "red") + # add a confidence band
  labs(
    x = "Normal Variable", # label the x-axis
    y = "Random Variable", # label the y-axis
    title = " Scatter Plot with Regression Line and Confidence Band" # add a title
