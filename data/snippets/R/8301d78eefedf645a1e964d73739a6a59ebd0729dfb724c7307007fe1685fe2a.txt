# This code snippet calculates the mean of a vector

# Define a vector with random values
v <- c(5.3, 2.8, 9.1, 4.6, 7.2)

# Calculate the sum of the values in the vector
s <- sum(v)

# Calculate the length of the vector
n <- length(v)

# Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the length
mean <- s/n

# Print the mean to the console
print(mean)

# Alternatively, use the built-in function to calculate the mean
mean <- mean(v)

# Print the mean to the console
print(mean)

# Output:
# 5.8
