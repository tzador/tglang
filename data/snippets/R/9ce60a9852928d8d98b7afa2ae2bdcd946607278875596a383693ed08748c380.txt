# Function to calculate Fibonacci sequence
# Parameters:
#   n: integer value indicating the length of the sequence
# Output:
#   Returns a vector containing the Fibonacci sequence of length n
fibonacci <- function(n) {
  # Initialize a vector to store the sequence
  sequence <- vector("numeric", n)
  # Set the first two values to 0 and 1
  sequence[1] <- 0
  sequence[2] <- 1
  # Use a for loop to generate the sequence
  for (i in 3:n) {
    # Calculate the next value in the sequence by adding the previous two values
    sequence[i] <- sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]
  }
  # Return the vector containing the Fibonacci sequence
  return(sequence)
}

# Call the function and store the output in a variable
output <- fibonacci(10)

# Print the output
print(output)
