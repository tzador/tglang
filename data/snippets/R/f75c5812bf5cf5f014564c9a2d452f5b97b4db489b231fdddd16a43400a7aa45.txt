# Creating a function to calculate the mean of a list of numbers
# Function name: mean_calc
# Input: list of numbers (vector)
# Output: mean of the list (numeric)

mean_calc <- function(numbers) {
  # Initialize a variable to store the total sum
  total_sum <- 0
  # Loop through the list and add each number to the total sum
  for (num in numbers) {
    total_sum <- total_sum + num
  }
  # Calculate the mean by dividing the total sum by the length of the list
  mean <- total_sum / length(numbers)
  # Return the mean
  return(mean)
}

# Example input list of numbers
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Call the function to calculate the mean
mean_of_numbers <- mean_calc(numbers)

# Print the mean
print(mean_of_numbers)

# Output: 3
