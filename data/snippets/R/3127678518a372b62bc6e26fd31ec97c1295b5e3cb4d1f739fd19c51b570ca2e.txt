# This is a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
# Input:
#   num: a positive integer number
# Output:
#   factorial: the calculated factorial of num

factorial <- function(num){
    # base case: if num is 1, factorial is 1
    if(num == 1){
        factorial <- 1
    }
    # recursive case: if num is greater than 1, factorial is num multiplied by the factorial of num-1
    else{
        factorial <- num * factorial(num-1)
    }
    # return the factorial
    return(factorial)
}

# example usage:
# calculate the factorial of 5
factorial(5)
