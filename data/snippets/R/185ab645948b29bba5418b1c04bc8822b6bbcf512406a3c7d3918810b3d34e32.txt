# This is a complex code snippet in R
# It calculates the average of two numbers using a for loop and an if statement
# Define variables
num1 <- 8
num2 <- 12

# Create a list of numbers
nums <- c(5, 10, 15, 20)

# Use a for loop to iterate through the list
for (num in nums) {
  # Use an if statement to check if num1 and num2 are equal to the current number in the list
  if (num1 == num | num2 == num) {
    # If the condition is met, print the average of num1 and num2
    print((num1 + num2) / 2)
  }
}
