### large and complex function
# this function takes in two vectors and calculates their L1 norm
# and returns the result

l1_norm <- function(vec1, vec2) {
  result <- 0 # initialize result variable
  
  # check that input is valid (both vectors have same length)
  if (length(vec1) != length(vec2)) {
    stop("Error: Vectors must have same length")
  }
  
  # loop through each element in the vectors and calculate absolute difference
  for (i in 1:length(vec1)) {
    result <- result + abs(vec1[i] - vec2[i])
  }
  
  return(result) # return the result
}
