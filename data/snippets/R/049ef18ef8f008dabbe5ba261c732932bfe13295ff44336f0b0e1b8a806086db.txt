# This is a code snippet in R that calculates the mean of a list of numbers

# Create a vector of numbers
numbers <- c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)

# Calculate the mean using the sum() function divided by the length of the vector
mean <- sum(numbers) / length(numbers)

# Print the mean
print(mean)

# Output: 15
