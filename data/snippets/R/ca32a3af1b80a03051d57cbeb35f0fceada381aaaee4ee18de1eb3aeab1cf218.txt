## Define a function to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a vector
mean_sd <- function(x) {
  # Calculate the mean of the vector
  mu <- sum(x) / length(x)

  # Calculate the squared deviations from the mean
  dev <- (x - mu) ^ 2

  # Calculate the variance by summing the squared deviations and dividing by n-1
  var <- sum(dev) / (length(x) - 1)

  # Calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance
  sd <- sqrt(var)

  # Return the mean and standard deviation as a list
  return(list(mean = mu,
              sd = sd))
}

## Create a vector of random numbers
v <- c(3, 5, 2, 7, 9, 1, 8, 4, 6)

## Call the function and assign the output to a variable
results <- mean_sd(v)

## Print the results
print(paste("The mean of the vector is", results$mean))
print(paste("The standard deviation of the vector is", results$sd))
