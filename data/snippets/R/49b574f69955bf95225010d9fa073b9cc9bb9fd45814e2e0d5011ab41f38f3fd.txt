# This is a code snippet in R
# It is a function to calculate the sum of squares
sum_of_squares <- function(x) {
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    sum <- 0
    
    # Loop through all elements in the given vector
    for (i in seq_along(x)) {
        # Calculate the square of the current element
        square <- x[i]^2
        
        # Add it to the sum
        sum <- sum + square
        
        # Print out the current element and its square
        print(paste("Element:", x[i], "- Square:", square))
    }
    
    # Return the final sum
    return(sum)
}

# Example input
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Output
sum_of_squares(numbers)
