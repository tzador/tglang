# This code snippet calculates the mean across each row in a data frame
# and then plots the data as a bar chart

# Import the necessary packages
library(ggplot2)

# Create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("John", "Jane", "Bob", "Mary"),
  Grade1 = c(80, 70, 90, 85),
  Grade2 = c(75, 85, 95, 65),
  Grade3 = c(90, 80, 70, 100)
)

# Calculate the mean across each row
row_means <- rowMeans(df)

# Convert the row means into a data frame
df_means <- data.frame(
  Name = df$Name,
  Mean = row_means
)

# Plot the data as a bar chart
ggplot(df_means, aes(x = Name, y = Mean)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Student Names", y = "Mean Grade", title = "Average Grades Across Students")
