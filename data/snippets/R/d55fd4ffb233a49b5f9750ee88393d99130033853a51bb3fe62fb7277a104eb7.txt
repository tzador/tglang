# This code snippet is a for loop that calculates the sum of an array of numbers

# Define the array of numbers
my_array <- c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)

# Initialize variables for the sum and length of the array
sum <- 0
length <- length(my_array)

# Loop through the array and add each element to the sum variable
for (i in 1:length) {
  sum <- sum + my_array[i]
}

# Print the sum to the console
print(sum)
