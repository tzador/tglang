# This code snippet calculates the mean using random numbers
# Generates a vector of 20 random numbers between 1 and 100
random_vector <- sample(1:100, 20, replace=TRUE)
# Print the random vector
random_vector
# Calculate the mean of the vector
mean <- sum(random_vector)/length(random_vector)
# Print the mean of the vector
