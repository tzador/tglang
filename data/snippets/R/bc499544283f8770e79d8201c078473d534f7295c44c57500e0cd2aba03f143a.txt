# This code snippet calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient for two variables
# Variable A and Variable B are assumed to be numeric vectors of equal length
# The output is a single value representing the correlation between the two variables

# Create two sample vectors of equal length
A <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
B <- c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Calculate the mean of each vector
mean_A <- mean(A)
mean_B <- mean(B)

# Calculate the sum of squares for each vector
ss_A <- sum((A-mean_A)^2)
ss_B <- sum((B-mean_B)^2)

# Calculate the sum of the products between A and B
ss_AB <- sum((A-mean_A)*(B-mean_B))

# Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient using the formula
cor <- ss_AB/sqrt(ss_A*ss_B)

# Print the result
print(cor)
