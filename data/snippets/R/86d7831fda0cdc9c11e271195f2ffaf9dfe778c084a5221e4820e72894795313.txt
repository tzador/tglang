# This code snippet uses the dplyr package to perform various data manipulation tasks
# Import dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# Load dataset
dataset <- read.csv("data.csv")

# Select columns with column names 'age' and 'gender'
dataset %>%
  select(age, gender) 

# Filter out rows where age is less than 25
dataset %>%
  filter(age < 25)

# Group data by gender and calculate the mean age for each gender
dataset %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(avg_age = mean(age))

# Add a new column with a calculated value
dataset %>%
  mutate(new_column = age * 2)

# Rename columns
dataset %>%
  rename(age_group = age, identity = gender)

# Join two datasets based on a common column
joined_data <- inner_join(dataset, dataset2, by = "id")

# Replace NA values with a given value
dataset %>%
  replace_na(list(age = 0, gender = "unknown"))

# Create a new dataset by sampling from the original dataset
new_dataset <- sample_n(dataset, 100)

# Export the new dataset as a CSV file
write.csv(new_dataset, "new_data.csv")
