# EXAMPLE CODE IN R
# This code creates a function called "linear_regression" that performs a linear regression on a given dataset
# and returns the coefficients and intercept

# Creating the function
linear_regression <- function(data) {
 
  # Fitting a linear model to the data
  reg <- lm(y ~ x, data = data)
  
  # Extracting the coefficients and intercept
  coefficients <- coef(reg)
  intercept <- coefficients[1]
  slope <- coefficients[2]
  
  # Creating a plot of the regression line
  plot(x, y, main = "Linear Regression", xlab = "X", ylab = "Y")
  abline(reg, col = "red", lwd = 2)
  
  # Returning the coefficients and intercept
  return(list(coefficient = slope, intercept = intercept))
  
}

# Calling the function on a given dataset
linear_regression(mtcars)
