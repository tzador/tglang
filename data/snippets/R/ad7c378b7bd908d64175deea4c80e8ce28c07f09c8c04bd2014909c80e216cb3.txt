# This is a function to calculate the factorial of a number
# Input: num - the number whose factorial is to be calculated
# Output: the factorial of the input number

factorial <- function(num) {
  # set initial result to 1
  result <- 1
  
  # loop through all numbers from 1 to the input number
  for(i in 1:num){
    # multiply the result by the current number
    result <- result * i
  }
  
  # return the final result
  result
}

# Example usage: calculate the factorial of 5
factorial(5)
# Output: 120

# Example usage: calculate the factorial of 10
factorial(10)
# Output: 3628800
