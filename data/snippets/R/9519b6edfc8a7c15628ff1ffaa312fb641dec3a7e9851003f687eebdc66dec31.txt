# This code snippet uses the "for" loop in R to perform a complex calculation
# First, we define the variables needed for the calculation
x <- 5 # An integer value
y <- 2.5 # A double value
z <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50) # A vector of integers

# Next, we define a function to perform the complex calculation
# The function takes in the variables x and y as parameters
# and returns a vector of the calculated values
calculation <- function(x, y) {
    result <- c() # Initialize an empty vector to store the results
    for(i in 1:length(z)) { # Loop through the elements in z
        result[i] <- (x + y) * z[i] # Perform the calculation and add it to the vector
    }
    return(result) # Return the resulting vector
}

# Finally, we call the function and store the result in a variable
# We also print out the result for display
result <- calculation(x, y)
print(result)
