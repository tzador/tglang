#This code snippet uses a for loop to print out the Fibonacci series up to a certain number entered by the user
#Declare variable to store user input
num <- as.integer(readline(prompt = "Enter a number: "))

#Initialize first two values of the Fibonacci sequence
first <- 0
second <- 1

#Print the first two values of the Fibonacci sequence
print(first)
print(second)

#Use a for loop to generate and print the remaining values of the sequence
for (i in 3:num) {
    #Calculate the next value of the sequence by adding the previous two values
    next <- first + second
    #Update the previous two values to prepare for the next iteration
    first <- second
    second <- next
    
    #Print the next value of the sequence
    print(next)
