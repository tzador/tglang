# This is a comment in R
# This code generates a dataframe with random numbers and calculates the mean of each column
# Define number of rows and columns
rows <- 100
cols <- 5

# Generate random numbers and save them as a matrix
data <- matrix(rnorm(rows*cols), nrow = rows, ncol = cols)

# Convert matrix to dataframe
df <- as.data.frame(data)

# Calculate mean of each column
means <- apply(df, 2, mean)

# Print mean of each column
print(means)
