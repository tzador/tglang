# This is a code snippet in R that uses the 'glm' function to perform logistic regression on a dataset 
# This dataset has categorical and numerical variables that will be used as predictors
# The goal is to predict the species of flowers based on their measurements

# Loading the necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Loading the dataset
data <- read.csv("iris.csv")

# Converting the species column to a factor
data$species <- as.factor(data$species) 

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
train <- data %>% 
  sample_frac(0.8) # 80% of data for training

test <- data %>%
  anti_join(train, by = "row.names") # remaining 20% for testing

# Fitting the model using the 'glm' function
model <- glm(species ~ ., data = train, family = binomial(link = "logit"))

# Making predictions on the test set
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test, type = "response")

# Evaluating the model using the confusion matrix
confusion_matrix <- table(test$species, predictions > 0.5)

# Visualizing the confusion matrix
