# This is a code snippet that creates a function in R to calculate the mean and median of a vector

# Create a function called mean_median that takes in a vector as input
mean_median <- function(x) {

  # Calculate the mean of the vector using the base R mean() function
  mean <- mean(x)

  # Calculate the median of the vector using the base R median() function
  median <- median(x)

  # Return a list containing both the mean and median values
  return(list(mean = mean, median = median))
}

# Create a vector of numbers to test the function
numbers <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

# Call the mean_median function on the numbers vector and store the result in a variable
result <- mean_median(numbers)

# Print the output in a formatted string
cat("The mean of the numbers vector is", result$mean, "and the median is", result$median, ".", sep = " ")
