# This is a function to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a vector
calculate_stats <- function(vector) {
  vector <- sort(vector) # sort the vector in ascending order
  mean <- sum(vector) / length(vector) # calculate the mean
  sd <- sqrt(sum((vector - mean)^2) / (length(vector) - 1)) # calculate the standard deviation
  return(list(mean = mean, sd = sd)) # return the mean and standard deviation as a list
}

# Example usage
vector <- c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)
stats <- calculate_stats(vector) # call the function
print(stats) # print the results

# Output:
# $mean
# [1] 15
#
# $sd
# [1] 8.660254
