# Define a function called 'factorial' with a parameter 'n'
factorial <- function(n) {
  # Create a variable 'result' and assign it the value of 1
  result <- 1 
  # Use a for-loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
  for (i in 1:n) { 
    # Multiply the current value of 'result' by the current number in the loop
    result <- result * i 
  }
  # Return the final value of 'result' as the factorial of n
  return(result) 
}
# Call the function and pass the value 5 as the argument for n
factorial(5) 
# Output: 120
