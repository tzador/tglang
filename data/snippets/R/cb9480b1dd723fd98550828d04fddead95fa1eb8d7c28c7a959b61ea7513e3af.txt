# This code snippet creates a data frame called 'my_data' with three columns: 'Name', 'Age', and 'City'.
# It then calculates the average age of individuals in each city and adds it as a fourth column.
# Finally, it sorts the data frame by the average age in descending order.

my_data <- data.frame(Name = c("John", "Sara", "David", "Emily"),
                      Age = c(29, 33, 25, 42),
                      City = c("New York", "San Francisco", "Los Angeles", "Seattle"))

city_avg_age <- my_data %>%
  group_by(City) %>%
  summarize(avg_age = mean(Age))

my_data <- my_data %>%
  left_join(city_avg_age, by = "City") %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_age)) # Sort data frame by average age in descending order

my_data # Print updated data frame
