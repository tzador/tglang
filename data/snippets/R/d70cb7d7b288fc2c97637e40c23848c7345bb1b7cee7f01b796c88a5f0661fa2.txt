# This code snippet uses the glm function to fit a generalized linear
# model with a Poisson distribution to a dataset and then predicts
# the expected number of events based on new data points.
library(stats) # loads the stats package

data <- read.csv("dataset.csv") # reads in the dataset
model <- glm(formula = cbind(events, total-events) ~ predictors,
             data = data,
             family = poisson) # fits a GLM with a Poisson family

new_data <- read.csv("new_data.csv") # reads in new data points
new_events <- predict(object = model,
                      newdata = new_data,
                      type = "response") # predicts expected number of events

print(new_events) # prints the predicted values
