# Define a function that calculates the factorial of a number
factorial <- function(x) {
  # Initialize result variable
  result <- 1
  # Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to x
  for (i in 1:x) {
    # Multiply result by current number in the loop
    result <- result * i
  }
  # Return the calculated result
  return(result)
}

# Call the function with a given number and print the result
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
