# This function takes in two vectors of numeric values and returns the product of their corresponding elements.
# INPUT: x, y (numeric vectors)
# OUTPUT: vector of element-wise product of x and y

   # initializing empty vector for output
   product <- vector()
   # loop through x and y vectors

# Example usage:
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c(5, 6, 7, 8)
elementwise_product(x, y)
# OUTPUT: 5, 12, 21, 32 (printed as a vector)
