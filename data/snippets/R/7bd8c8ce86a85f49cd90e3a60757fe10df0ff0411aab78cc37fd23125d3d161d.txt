# This is a code that generates a numerical sequence based on the Fibonacci sequence

# Define the function with one argument for the number of elements in the sequence
fibonacci <- function(n) {

    # Initialize an empty vector to store the sequence
    sequence <- c()

    # Loop through the number of elements specified
    for (i in 1:n) {

        # Use if statement to check for first two elements
        if (i == 1) {
            # Add first element to sequence vector
            sequence <- c(sequence, 0)

        } else if (i == 2) {
            # Add second element to sequence vector
            sequence <- c(sequence, 1)

        } else {
            # Use previous two elements to calculate next element
            next <- sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]
            # Add next element to sequence vector
            sequence <- c(sequence, next)
        }
    }

    # Return the final sequence vector
    return(sequence)
}

# Call the fibonacci function with 10 as the argument (for 10 elements in sequence)
fibonacci(10)

# Output:
# [1] 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
