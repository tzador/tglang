# This code snippet generates a random sample from a normal distribution 
# with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
sample <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1) # 1000 values generated from a normal distribution

hist(sample, breaks = 30, col = "blue", main = "Distribution of Random Sample") # creates a histogram of the generated sample with 30 breaks and blue color
