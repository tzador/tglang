# Example of function to calculate the standard deviation of a given vector
# Input: a vector of numbers
# Output: the standard deviation of the vector

calculate_sd <- function(x) { # defining the function with input parameter x
  n <- length(x) # calculating the length of the vector
  mean <- sum(x)/n # calculating the mean of the vector
  diffs <- x - mean # calculating the differences between each element and the mean
  squared_diffs <- diffs^2 # squaring the differences
  sum_squared_diffs <- sum(squared_diffs) # summing the squared differences
  sd <- sqrt(sum_squared_diffs/(n-1)) # calculating the standard deviation
  return(sd) # returning the result
}

# Testing the function with a sample vector
test_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
calculate_sd(test_vector) # output: 1.581139
