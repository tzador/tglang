# This is a code snippet in R that performs a linear regression analysis
# and plots the results on a scatter plot with a line of best fit.

# Loading the dataset
dataset <- read.csv("data.csv")

# Performing the linear regression
regression <- lm(Y ~ X, data = dataset)

# Plotting the scatter plot of the data
plot(X, Y, main = "Scatter Plot with Line of Best Fit", xlab = "Independent Variable", ylab = "Dependent Variable")
abline(regression, col = "red", lwd = 2) # Adding a line of best fit to the plot

# Printing the summary of the regression model
summary(regression)
