# Define a function that calculates the mean of a vector
` ` `R
mean <- function(vector) {
  sum <- 0 # initialize sum variable to 0
  n <- length(vector) # get length of vector
  for (i in 1:n) { # loop through vector
    sum <- sum + vector[i] # add current element to sum
  }
  return(sum/n) # return sum divided by number of elements
}

# Example usage
` ` `R
my_vector <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9) # create a vector
mean(my_vector) # call mean function on vector
# Output: 5
