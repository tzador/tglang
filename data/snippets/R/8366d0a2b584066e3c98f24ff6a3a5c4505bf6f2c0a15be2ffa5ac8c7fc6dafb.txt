# This code snippet takes in a list of numbers and computes their mean
# and standard deviation

# Define the function for calculating mean
mean_calc <- function(numbers) {
    sum <- 0 # initialize a variable to store sum of numbers
    for (num in numbers) { # loop through each element in the list
        sum <- sum + num # add number to sum
    }

    mean <- sum/length(numbers) # calculate mean by dividing sum by length of list

    return(mean) # return the mean
}

# Define the function for calculating standard deviation
std_dev <- function(numbers) {
    mean <- mean_calc(numbers) # call the mean_calc function to get the mean

    # initialize a variable to store the sum of squared differences
    var_sum <- 0

    for (num in numbers) { # loop through each element in the list
        # calculate the difference of each number from the mean
        diff <- num - mean
        # square the difference and add it to the variable
        var_sum <- var_sum + diff^2
    }

    # calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the
    # sum of squared differences divided by the length of the list minus one
    sd <- sqrt(var_sum/(length(numbers)-1))
