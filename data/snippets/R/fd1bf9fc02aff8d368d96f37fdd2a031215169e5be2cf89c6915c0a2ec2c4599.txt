# This function calculates the factorial of a given number
# Parameters:
# num: the number to calculate the factorial of
# Returns: the factorial of the given number
factorial <- function(num) {
    result <- 1 # initializes the result variable to 1
    for (i in 1:num) { # loop through numbers from 1 to num
        result <- result * i # multiply result by each number
    }
    return(result) # return the final result
}

# Example usage
# Calculates the factorial of 5 and saves it in variable 'factorial_of_five'
factorial_of_five <- factorial(5)

print(factorial_of_five) # prints the result which should be 120
