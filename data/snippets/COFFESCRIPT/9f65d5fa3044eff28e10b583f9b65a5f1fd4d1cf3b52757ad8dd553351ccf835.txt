### A function that calculates the total cost of coffee orders ###

calculateCoffeeCost = (orderList) ->
  # Initialize variable to store total cost
  totalCost = 0
  
  # Loop through each order in the list
  for order in orderList
    # Get the type of coffee and quantity from the order
    type = order.type
    quantity = order.quantity
    
    # Calculate the cost for each order
    if type is "latte"
      cost = 5 * quantity
    else if type is "cappuccino"
      cost = 6.5 * quantity
    else if type is "mocha"
      cost = 7 * quantity
    else
      # Handle invalid types of coffee
      throw new Error("Invalid type of coffee!")
    
    # Add the cost of the current order to the total cost
    totalCost += cost
  
  # Return the total cost
  return totalCost

# Example usage:
coffeeOrders = [
  {type: "latte", quantity: 2},
  {type: "cappuccino", quantity: 3},
  {type: "mocha", quantity: 1}
]

# Call the calculateCoffeeCost function and store the result in a variable
total = calculateCoffeeCost(coffeeOrders)

# Print the total cost
console.log("The total cost of the coffee orders is $" + total)
