### This function calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number ###
### Parameters: num - The highest number in the sequence to calculate ###
### Returns: An array containing the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number ###

fib = (num) ->
  # Initialize an empty array to hold the sequence
  sequence = []

  # Loop through the numbers up to num
  for i in [0..num]
    # Check if i is 0 or 1, as these are the first two numbers in the sequence
    if i is 0 or i is 1
      sequence.push(i)
    # If i is not 0 or 1, calculate the Fibonacci number and push it to the array
    else
      sequence.push(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])

  # Return the completed sequence
  return sequence

# Call the function with a given number and store the result in a variable
result = fib(10)

# Print out the result
console.log(result)

# Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
