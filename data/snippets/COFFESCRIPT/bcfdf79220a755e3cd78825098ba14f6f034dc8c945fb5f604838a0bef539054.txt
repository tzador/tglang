mul = (numOne, numTwo) -> # This is an arrow function with numOne and numTwo as parameters
  if numOne > 0 and numTwo > 0 # This checks if the numbers are positive
    return numOne * numTwo # if they are, the product is returned
  else
    console.log("Please enter positive numbers only") # if either number is not positive, an error message is logged to the console
    return null # returns null if the inputs are not positive

# Example usage:
mul(5, 10) # returns 50
mul(-5, 10) # logs "Please enter positive numbers only" and returns null
mul(5, -10) # logs "Please enter positive numbers only" and returns null
