# This COFFESCRIPT function takes in two arrays and outputs a new array that is a combination of the two.
combineArrays = (arr1, arr2) ->
  # Declare an empty array to store the combined elements.
  combinedArr = []
  # Loop through the first array and push each element into the combined array.
  for elem in arr1
    combinedArr.push(elem)
  # Loop through the second array and push each element into the combined array.
  for elem in arr2
    combinedArr.push(elem)
  # Return the combined array.
  combinedArr

# Example input arrays.
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = [4, 5, 6]

# Call the function to combine the arrays and store the output in a variable.
combined = combineArrays(arr1, arr2)

# Print the combined array.
console.log(combined)

# Output:
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
