#This Coffeescript code snippet creates a class called "Person" with two properties: name and age
class Person
  constructor: (@name, @age) ->

  #This method uses string interpolation and console.log in Coffeescript to display a greeting
  sayHello: ->
    console.log "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."

#Instantiate a new instance of Person with the name "John" and age "25"
john = new Person("John", 25)

#Call the sayHello method on the john object to display a greeting
john.sayHello()

#Output:
#Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
