This is a complex code snippet in Coffeescript.
It includes multiple functions with if/else statements, loops, and objects.

# Function that takes in a number and returns its factorial
factorial = (num) ->
  if num is 0
    return 1
  else
    result = 1
    for i in [2..num]
      result *= i
    return result

# Object representing a car
car =
  make: "Tesla"
  model: "Model 3"
  year: 2020
  color: "red"
  # Function that checks if the car's color is red
  checkColor: ->
    if @color is "red"
      console.log("This car is red.")
    else
      console.log("This car is not red.")

# Function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum
sumArray = (arr) ->
  total = 0
  for num in arr
    total += num
  return total

# Object representing a user
user =
  name: "John"
  age: 24
  gender: "male"
  # Function that checks if the user is old enough to drink (21+)
  checkAge: ->
    if @age >= 21
      console.log("This user is old enough to drink.")
    else
      console.log("This user is not old enough to drink.")

# Calling the functions and accessing the objects
result = factorial(5) # returns 120
car.checkColor() # logs "This car is red."
total = sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # returns 15
user.checkAge() # logs "This user is old enough to drink."
