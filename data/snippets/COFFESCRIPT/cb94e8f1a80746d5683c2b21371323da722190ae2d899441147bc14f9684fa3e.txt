  This is a comment in COFFEESCRIPT

  Multi-line comments in COFFEESCRIPT
  are represented by triple # symbols
  at the beginning and end.

  They are useful for documenting
  code or temporarily disabling
  certain lines of code.

  Even though they are not executed,
  they will still be included in the
  compiled JavaScript output.

  Comments can also be used for organizing
  and dividing code into sections.
