# This is a complex function that takes in two parameters, a number and a string.
# It first checks if the number is divisible by 2 and if so, adds it to an array.
# Then it loops through each character in the string and checks if it is a vowel.
# If it is, it adds it to the array as well.
# Finally, it returns the array, which will contain any even numbers and vowels in the string.
