# CoffeeScript Code Snippet
# This code snippet demonstrates a function called `sumArray` that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

sumArray = (array) ->
  sum = 0 # initialize the sum to 0
  for num in array # loop through each element in the array
    sum += num # add current element to sum
  return sum # return the final sum

console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) # prints 15, the sum of the numbers in the array
