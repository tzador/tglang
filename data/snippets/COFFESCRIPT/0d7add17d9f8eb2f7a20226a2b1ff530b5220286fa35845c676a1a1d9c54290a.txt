### This code snippet uses COFFESCRIPT to create a constructor function for a car class ###
class Car
  # defining constructor function with make, model and year as parameters
  constructor: (make, model, year) ->
    # creating class level properties
    @make = make
    @model = model
    @year = year
    # creating an empty array to store car colors
    @colors = []
    # creating an empty object to store car features
    @features = {}
  
  # method to add colors to the colors array
  addColor: (color) ->
    @colors.push(color)
  
  # method to add features to the features object
  addFeatures: (key, value) ->
    @features[key] = value
  
  # method to get make of the car
  getMake: () ->
    return @make
  
  # method to get model of the car
  getModel: () ->
    return @model
  
  # method to get year of the car
  getYear: () ->
    return @year
  
  # method to get all colors of the car
  getColors: () ->
    return @colors
  
  # method to get all features of the car
  getFeatures: () ->
    return @features
