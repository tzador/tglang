# A simple function to calculate the area of a circle given the radius
area = (radius) ->
  pi = 3.14 # Assign our constant value for pi
  return pi * radius * radius # Calculate area using pi and radius

# A basic class for creating and manipulating shapes
class Shape

  # Constructor function
  constructor: (name) ->
    @name = name # Set the name of the shape
    @color = "red" # Set default color to red

  # Function to print the name of the shape
  printName: () ->
    console.log("The name of the shape is #{@name}")

  # Function to change the color of the shape
  changeColor: (newColor) ->
    @color = newColor
    console.log("The color of #{@name} was changed to #{@color}")

# Child class of Shape for creating circles
class Circle extends Shape

  # Constructor function
  constructor: (name, radius) ->
    super(name) # Call parent constructor with shape name
    @radius = radius # Set the radius of the circle

  # Function to calculate the circumference of the circle
  calculateCircumference: () ->
    pi = 3.14 # Assign our constant value for pi
    return 2 * pi * @radius # Calculate circumference using pi and radius

# Create a new circle object with a name and radius
myCircle = new Circle("myCircle", 5)

# Print the name of the circle
myCircle.printName()

# Change the color of the circle
myCircle.changeColor("blue")

# Calculate and print the area of the circle
console.log("The area of #{@name} is #{area(@radius)}")

# Calculate and print the circumference of the circle
console.log("The circumference of #{@name} is #{myCircle.calculateCircumference()}")
