# This code snippet calculates the average of a list of number inputs
# First, we define a function called 'calculateAverage' with one parameter 'numbers'
calculateAverage = (numbers) ->
  total = 0 # initialize a variable 'total' to store the sum of numbers
  for number in numbers # for loop to iterate through the input list
    total += number # add each number to 'total' variable
  result = total / numbers.length # calculate the average by dividing total by length of input list
  return result # return the average to the caller

# Sample list of numbers for testing
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
# Call the 'calculateAverage' function with the list as its argument
average = calculateAverage(numbers)
# Print the result to the console
console.log("The average of the list is: #{average}")
