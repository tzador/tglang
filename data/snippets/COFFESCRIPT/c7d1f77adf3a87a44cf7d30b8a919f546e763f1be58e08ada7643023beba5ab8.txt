# CoffeeScript code to generate a list of users

# Defining two classes, User and Address, with attributes
class User
  constructor: (@name, @email)

class Address
  constructor: (@street, @city, @state)

# Initializing an array of three User objects
users = [
  new User "John", "john@example.com"
  new User "Jane", "jane@example.com"
  new User "Alex", "alex@example.com"
]

# Creating a nested array to store addresses for each user
addresses = [
  [new Address "123 Main St", "New York", "NY"], # Address for John
  [new Address "456 Broadway", "Los Angeles", "CA"], # Address for Jane
  [new Address "789 Oak St", "Chicago", "IL"] # Address for Alex
]

# Function to generate the list of users with their addresses
generateUserList = (users, addresses) ->
  for user, index in users
    # Accessing the corresponding address for the user from the nested array
    address = addresses[index]

    # Creating a string with the user's name and address
    userString = "#{user.name} from #{address.street}, #{address.city}, #{address.state}"

    # Logging the string to the console
    console.log(userString)

# Calling the function with the users and addresses arrays
generateUserList(users, addresses) # Output: John from 123 Main St, New York, NY
                                  # Jane from 456 Broadway, Los Angeles, CA
                                  # Alex from 789 Oak St, Chicago, IL
