# Declaring a function
square = (x) ->
  # Using the exponential operator to calculate the square of x
  x ** 2

# Declaring an array
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using a for loop to iterate through the array
for number in numbers
  # Calling the square function on each element
  square(number)

# Declaring an object with a method
person =
  name: "John"
  age: 18
  # Method to greet the person
  greet: ->
    alert "Hello, my name is #{this.name} and I am #{this.age} years old"

# Calling the greet method on the person object
person.greet()

# Using conditional statements
if person.age < 21
  alert "Sorry, I cannot legally serve you coffee"
else
  alert "Enjoy your coffee!"

# Output:
# Hello, my name is John and I am 18 years old
# Sorry, I cannot legally serve you coffee
