# Annotated Code Snippet in COFFESCRIPT
#This is a function called "calculatePower" that takes in two parameters, "num" and "power"
calculatePower = (num, power) ->
  # Initializing a variable "result" and setting it to 1
  result = 1

  # Looping from 1 to the value of "power"
  for i in [1..power]
    # Multiplies the current "result" value by "num"
    result *= num
  
  # Returns the final value of "result"
  return result

# Storing the result of calling "calculatePower" with parameters 5 and 3 in a variable "answer"
answer = calculatePower(5, 3)

# Printing the value of "answer" to the console
console.log answer

# Expected Output: 125
