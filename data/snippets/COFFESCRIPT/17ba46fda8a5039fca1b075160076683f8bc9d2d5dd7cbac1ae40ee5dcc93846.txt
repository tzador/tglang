# A function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum
sum = (numbers) -> 
  result = 0
  # Declare a variable to store the result
  for number in numbers 
    # Loop through each number in the array
    result += number
    # Add the number to the result
  result
  # Return the result
  
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Example array to test the function
total = sum(numbers)
# Call the function and store the returned value in a variable
console.log(total)
# Print the total to the console
