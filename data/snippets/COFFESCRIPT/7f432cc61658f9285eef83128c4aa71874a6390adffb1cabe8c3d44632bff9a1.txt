# Simple function that returns the sum of two numbers
add = (a, b) ->
  a + b

# Class representing a car
class Car
  constructor: (@brand, @color, @speed) ->

  # Method to accelerate the car
  accelerate: (amount) ->
    @speed += amount

# Creating an instance of the Car class
redCar = new Car("Ford", "red", 0)

# Calling the accelerate method on the redCar instance
redCar.accelerate(10)

# Output should be 10
console.log(redCar.speed)

# Output should be "Ford"
console.log(redCar.brand)

# Output should be "red"
console.log(redCar.color)
