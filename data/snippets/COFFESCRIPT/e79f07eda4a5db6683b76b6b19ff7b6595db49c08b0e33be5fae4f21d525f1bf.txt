### This code snippet creates a function that calculates the average of three numbers ###

â€‹
# App calculates average of three numbers
calculate average = (num1, num2, num3) ->
  sum = num1 + num2 + num3 # calculates sum of three numbers
  avg = sum / 3 # calculates average by dividing sum by 3
  return avg # returns average as output
}

# Usage: 
# input three numbers
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
num3 = 3

# Call the function to calculate average
result = calculate_average(num1, num2, num3)

# Print the result
console.log(result) # prints 6, which is the average of the three input numbers
