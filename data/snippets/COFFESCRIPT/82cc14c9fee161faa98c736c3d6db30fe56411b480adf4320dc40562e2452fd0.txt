# Annotated code snippet in Coffeescript

# Define a function named 'calculateSalary'
calculateSalary = (hours, rate) ->
  totalSalary = hours * rate  # Multiply the hours worked by the hourly rate to get total salary
  console.log "Total salary: #{totalSalary}" # Print the total salary to the console
  return totalSalary # Return the total salary

# Define a variable named 'hoursWorked' and set its value to 40
hoursWorked = 40

# Define a variable named 'hourlyRate' and set its value to 20
hourlyRate = 20

# Call the calculateSalary function with 'hoursWorked' and 'hourlyRate'
calculateSalary(hoursWorked, hourlyRate)

# Expected output:
# Total salary: 800
