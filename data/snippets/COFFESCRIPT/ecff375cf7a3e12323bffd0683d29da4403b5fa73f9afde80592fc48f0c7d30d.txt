#This code snippet uses CoffeeScript to generate a list of numbers.

#Define a function that takes in a parameter, n, representing the length of the list to be generated.
fn = (n) ->
    #Create an empty array to store the numbers.
    nums = []

    #Iterate from 0 to n, adding each number to the array.
    for i in [0...n]
        nums.push(i)

    #Return the array of numbers.
    return nums

#Call the function and pass in the desired length of the list.
#In this example, a list of 10 numbers will be generated.
numList = fn(10)

#Print the list to the console.
console.log("The list of numbers is: ", numList)
