### This code snippet uses the ES6 "class" syntax to create a Person class with a constructor and several methods. ###

class Person 
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age

  changeName: (newName) ->
    @name = newName

  celebrateBirthday: ->
    @age++

  checkAge: ->
    if @age > 18
      console.log "#{@name} is an adult."
    else
      console.log "#{@name} is still a minor."

  introduceSelf: ->
    console.log "Hi, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."

### This code creates a new instance of the Person class and calls its methods. ###

jane = new Person("Jane", 25)

jane.introduceSelf() # Output: Hi, my name is Jane and I am 25 years old.

jane.celebrateBirthday()

jane.checkAge() # Output: Jane is an adult.

jane.changeName("Janie")

jane.introduceSelf() # Output: Hi, my name is Janie and I am 26 years old.
