# Annotated COFFESCRIPT code snippet

# Define an array containing numbers from 1 to 10
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Define a function to calculate the sum of all numbers in an array
sum = (arr) ->
  total = 0
  for num in arr
    total += num
  total  # Returns the total sum

# Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial = (num) ->
  if num <= 0
    return 1
  else
    return num * factorial(num - 1)

# Define a variable to store the sum of all numbers in the array
total_sum = sum(numbers)

# Define a variable to store the factorial of the total sum
total_factorial = factorial(total_sum)

# Print the total sum and total factorial
console.log("The total sum of numbers in the array is " + total_sum)
console.log("The factorial of the total sum is " + total_factorial)
