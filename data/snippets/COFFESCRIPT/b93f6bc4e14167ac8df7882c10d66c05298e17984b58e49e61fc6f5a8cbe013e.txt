# Function to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial = (n) ->
  # Initialize the result variable
  result = 1
  # Loop through values from 1 to n
  for i in [1..n]
    # Multiply result by current value
    result = result * i
  # Return the final result value
  return result

# Example input
n = 4

# Call the factorial function on n and assign the result to a variable
fact = factorial(n)

# Print the result to the console
console.log "The factorial of #{n} is #{fact}"

# Output:
# The factorial of 4 is 24
