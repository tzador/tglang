## This code snippet uses Coffeescript to define a class

### Create a Coffee class with a constructor function that takes in name and type as parameters
class Coffee
  constructor: (name, type) ->
    @name = name
    @type = type
    @ingredients = ["Espresso", "Milk", "Water"]

### Add a method to the class that prints out the ingredients of the coffee
  printIngredients: () ->
    console.log "Ingredients: #{@ingredients}"
    
### Create an instance of the Coffee class
coffee = new Coffee("Cappuccino", "HOT")

### Call the method to print out the ingredients
coffee.printIngredients()
