# Define a function called 'add' that takes in two parameters - 'x' and 'y'
add = (x, y) ->
  # Assign the sum of 'x' and 'y' to a variable called 'sum'
  sum = x + y
  # Check if the value of 'sum' is greater than or equal to 50
  if sum >= 50
    # Print out a message to the console if the condition is met
    console.log("The sum is greater than or equal to 50.")
  # Otherwise, print out a different message
  else
    console.log("The sum is less than 50.")
  # Return the value of 'sum'
  return sum

# Call the 'add' function and pass in the values 25 and 30
add(25, 30)

# Output: The sum is less than 50.
