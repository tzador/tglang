# Function to calculate the factorial of a given number
factorial = (num) ->
  # Assign a local variable to hold the result
  result = 1

  # Loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number
  for i in [1..num]

    # Multiply the result by the current number in the loop
    result *= i

  # Return the final result
  return result

# Assign a variable to hold the input number
inputNumber = 5

# Call the factorial function and pass in the input number
factorialResult = factorial(inputNumber)

# Print the result to the console
console.log("The factorial of " + inputNumber + " is: " + factorialResult)
