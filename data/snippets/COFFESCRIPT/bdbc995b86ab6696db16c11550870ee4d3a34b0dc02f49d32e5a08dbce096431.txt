# This code snippet generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

# Function to generate the sequence
fib = (n) ->
  # Initialize first two numbers in the sequence
  first = 0
  second = 1
  # Empty array to store the sequence
  sequence = []

  # Loop through 'n' times
  for i in [0...n]
    # Add the next number to the sequence
    sequence.push(first)
    # Calculate the next number by summing the previous two
    temp = first + second
    # Update the variables
    first = second
    second = temp

  # Return the sequence
  sequence

# Call the function and save the result in a variable
result = fib(10)

# Output the result
console.log(`Fibonacci sequence up to 10: ${result}`)
