square = (x) -> #creates a function called "square" with parameter x
  x * x # multiplies parameter x with itself to get the square
number = 5 # sets the value of number to 5
squared_number = square(number) # calls the square function with number as the argument
console.log squared_number # prints the squared number to the console.
