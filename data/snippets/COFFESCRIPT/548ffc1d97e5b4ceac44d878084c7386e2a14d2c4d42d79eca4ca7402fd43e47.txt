# Create a multiply function
multiply = (a, b) ->
    result = a * b # Calculating the result
    console.log("Result:", result) # Logging the result to console
    return result # Returning the result

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]

# Loop through the list and multiply each number by 2
for n in numbers
  multiplied = multiply(n, 2) # Calling the multiply function
  console.log("Multiplied", n, "by 2 and got", multiplied) # Logging the process and result

# Output:
