# Annotated COFFESCRIPT Code Snippet
# This snippet uses a function to calculate and return the factorial of a number

# Function to calculate factorial of a number
factorial = (num) ->
  # Initialize result variable
  result = 1
  # Use for loop to iterate from 1 to num
  for i in [1..num]
    # Multiply current result by current value of i
    result *= i
  # Return result
  result

# Call the factorial function with a value of 5 and store the result in a variable
factorial_of_5 = factorial(5)

# Print the factorial_of_5 variable
console.log(factorial_of_5)

# Output: 120
