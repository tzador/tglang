# This code snippet uses the COFFEESCRIPT language to generate a deck of playing cards. It first creates arrays for the suits and ranks, and then iterates through both arrays to create a new card object for each possible combination. The value of each card is set to 0 by default. Finally, the deck is returned, containing 52 card objects.
