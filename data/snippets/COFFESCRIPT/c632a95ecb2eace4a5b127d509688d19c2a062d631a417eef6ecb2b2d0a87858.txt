# This is a code snippet in COFFEESCRIPT

# Define a function that calculates the factorial of a number
func factorial(n) {
    result = 1
    # Loop through each number from 1 to n
    for i in [1..n]
        # Multiply result by current number
        result = result * i
    return result
}

# Define a variable to store a random number
num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)

# Call the factorial function and store the result in a new variable
fact = factorial(num)

# Print the result to the console
console.log("The factorial of " + num + " is: " + fact)

# Output: The factorial of 5 is: 120
