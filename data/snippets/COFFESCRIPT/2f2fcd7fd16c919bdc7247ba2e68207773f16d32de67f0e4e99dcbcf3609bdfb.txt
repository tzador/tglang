# This function takes in a list of numbers as input
# and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.
sum = (numbers) ->
  result = 0 # initialize result variable to 0

  for num in numbers # loop through each number in the list
    result += num # add the number to the result variable

  return result # return the final sum

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] # create a list of numbers
total_sum = sum(numbers) # call the sum function on the list of numbers
console.log(total_sum) # print the sum to the console
