### Defining a class ###
class Animal
  # This is the constructor method
  constructor: (@name, @type) ->
    @age = 0

  # This is a method that returns the animal's age
  getAge: () ->
    @age

  # This is a method that sets the animal's age
  setAge: (newAge) ->
    @age = newAge

  # This is a method that prints the animal's name
  printName: () ->
    console.log "The animal's name is #{@name}"

# Creating an instance of Animal class
myAnimal = new Animal("Leo", "Lion")

# Setting the age of the animal
myAnimal.setAge(5)

# Getting the age of the animal
age = myAnimal.getAge()

# Printing the animal's name
myAnimal.printName()
