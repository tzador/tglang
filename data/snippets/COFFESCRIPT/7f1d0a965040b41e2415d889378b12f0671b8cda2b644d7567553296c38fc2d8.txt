# This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and multiplies them all together
multiply = (numList) ->
    total = 1  # variable to store the total product
    for num in numList # loop through the list of numbers
        total = total * num  # multiply the current total by the current number
    return total  # return the final product

console.log(multiply([2, 3, 4]))  # should output 24
console.log(multiply([5, 6, 7]))  # should output 210
