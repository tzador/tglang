### This is a code snippet in COFFESCRIPT, a language that compiles to JavaScript ###

# Define a function that takes in two parameters and returns the sum of those two numbers #
add = (x, y) ->
  return x + y

# Define a class that has a constructor and two methods #
class Person
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age
  
  # Method that returns the person's name #
  getName: ->
    return @name
  
  # Method that returns the person's age #
  getAge: ->
    return @age

# Create a new instance of the Person class #
person = new Person("John", 25)

# Call the getName method on the person instance #
console.log(person.getName()) # This should output "John"

# Define an array of numbers #
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use a for loop to iterate through the array and print the index and element #
for num, i in numbers
  console.log(`The number at index ${i} is ${num}`)

# Define a promise that resolves after 1 second #
promise = new Promise (resolve, reject) ->
  setTimeout (->
    resolve("Promise resolved after 1 second")
  , 1000)
  
# Call the promise and use 'then' to handle the resolved value #
promise.then (result) ->
  console.log(result) # This should output "Promise resolved after 1 second"
