### Function to calculate the factorial of a number ###

factorial = (num) ->
  result = 1
  # Loop through numbers from 1 to num
  for i in [1..num]
    # Multiply each number with the result
    result *= i
  # Return the final result
  return result

# Call the function and pass in a number
num = 5
result = factorial(num)

# Print the result
console.log(result)

# Output: 120 (5! = 120)
