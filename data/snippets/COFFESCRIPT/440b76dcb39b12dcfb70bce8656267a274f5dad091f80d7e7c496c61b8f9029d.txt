# Define a function named `multiply` that takes in two parameters, `a` and `b`.
multiply = (a, b) ->
  # Set the result variable to 0.
  result = 0
  # Create a loop that will run `b` number of times.
  for i in [0..b] by 1
    # Add `a` to `result` each time the loop runs.
    result += a
  # Return the final `result`.
  return result

# Call the `multiply` function with the arguments 6 and 8, and assign the result to `answer`.
answer = multiply(6, 8)

# Log the `answer` variable to the console.
console.log(answer)

# Output should be 48.
