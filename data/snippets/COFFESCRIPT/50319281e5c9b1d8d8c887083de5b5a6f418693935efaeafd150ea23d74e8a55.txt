### This code snippet is a function that takes in two arrays and sorts them using the bubble sort algorithm

bubble_sort = (arr1, arr2) ->
  # initialize a variable for the sorted array
  sorted_array = []

  # loop through first array
  for i in [0...arr1.length]
    # add current element to sorted array
    sorted_array.push(arr1[i])

    # loop through second array
    for j in [0...arr2.length]
      # if current element in second array is smaller than first array
      if arr2[j] < arr1[i]
        # insert current element into sorted array in correct position
        sorted_array.splice(i, 0, arr2[j])
        # break out of loop
        break

  # loop through second array to add remaining elements to sorted array
  for i in [0...arr2.length]
    # if current element has not been added to sorted array yet
    if sorted_array.indexOf(arr2[i]) == -1
      # add current element to sorted array
      sorted_array.push(arr2[i])

  # return sorted array
  sorted_array
