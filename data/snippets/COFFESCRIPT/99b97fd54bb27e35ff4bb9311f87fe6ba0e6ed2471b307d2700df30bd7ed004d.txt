## Creating a function that checks for prime numbers
checkPrime = (num) ->
    primes = []
    # Loop through all numbers from 2 to num
    for i in [2..num]
        # Assume the number is prime
        isPrime = true
        # Loop through all numbers from 2 to i-1
        for j in [2..i-1]
            # If the number is divisible by any number from 2 to i-1, it is not prime
            if i % j is 0
                isPrime = false
                break
        # If the number is still prime, add it to the list of primes
        if isPrime is true
            primes.push(i)
    # Return the list of primes
    return primes
