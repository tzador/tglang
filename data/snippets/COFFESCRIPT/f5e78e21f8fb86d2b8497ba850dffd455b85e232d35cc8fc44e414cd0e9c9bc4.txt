###This is a comment in CoffeeScript
count = 0

while count < 10
    console.log "Current count is #{count}."
    count++

if count == 10
    console.log "Congrats! You have reached 10."

###Here we are defining a function with two parameters
calculateSum = (num1, num2) ->
    sum = num1 + num2
    console.log "The sum of #{num1} and #{num2} is #{sum}."
    
###Here we are calling the function and passing in two numbers as arguments
calculateSum(5, 7)
