# This is an example function in Coffeescript
# It takes in two numbers and returns the sum of them
sum = (num1, num2) ->
  # Declare and initialize a variable named 'result' to store the sum
  result = num1 + num2
  # Return the 'result' variable
  return result

# Declare two variables to hold different numbers
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Call the 'sum' function and pass in the two numbers as arguments
# Store the returned value in a variable named 'total'
total = sum(number1, number2)

# Log the result to the console with a descriptive message
console.log("The sum of " + number1 + " and " + number2 + " is " + total)
