# Function that checks if a given number is a prime number
# Takes in a number as a parameter
# Returns true if the number is a prime number, false if it is not
isPrime = (number) ->
  # Check if number is less than 2, since 0 and 1 are not considered prime
  if number < 2
    return false

  # Use a for loop to check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number
  # We only need to check up to the square root of the number because any factor above that will have a corresponding factor below it
  for i in [2..Math.sqrt(number)]
    # If the number is divisible by the current number in the loop, it is not a prime number
    if number % i is 0
      return false

  # If the number is not divisible by any number in the loop, it is a prime number
  return true

# Call the function with the number 17 and log the result to the console
console.log(isPrime(17))
