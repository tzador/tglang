# Defining a CoffeeScript function that takes two parameters
myFunction = (x, y) ->
  # Conditional statement to check if x is less than y
  if x < y
    console.log "#{x} is less than #{y}"
  # Conditional statement to check if x is greater than y
  else if x > y
    console.log "#{x} is greater than #{y}"
  # Conditional statement to check if x is equal to y
  else
    console.log "#{x} is equal to #{y}"
# Assigning values to the parameters
x = 5
y = 10
# Calling the function with the assigned values
myFunction(x, y)
# Output: 5 is less than 10
