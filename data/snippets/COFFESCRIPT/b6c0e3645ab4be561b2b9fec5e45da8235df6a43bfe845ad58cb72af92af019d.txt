### The following code snippet uses Coffeescript to create a list of numbers and perform mathematical operations on them ###

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ## Create a list of numbers

sum = 0 ## Initialize a variable to store the sum
product = 1 ## Initialize a variable to store the product
average = 0 ## Initialize a variable to store the average

add = (x, y) -> ## Define a function to add two numbers using arrow syntax
  x + y

multiply = (x, y) -> ## Define a function to multiply two numbers using arrow syntax
  x * y

for number in numbers ## Create a loop to iterate through the numbers list
  sum = add(sum, number) ## Add each number to the sum variable
  product = multiply(product, number) ## Multiply each number to the product variable

average = sum / numbers.length ## Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list

console.log("The sum of the numbers is #{sum}") ## Print out the final sum
console.log("The product of the numbers is #{product}") ## Print out the final product
console.log("The average of the numbers is #{average}") ## Print out the final average
