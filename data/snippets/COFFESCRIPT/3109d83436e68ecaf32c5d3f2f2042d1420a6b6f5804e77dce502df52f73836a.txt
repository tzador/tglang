###
This function takes in a number and checks if it is prime
and returns a boolean value
###
isPrime = (number) ->
  if number < 2 #if number is less than 2, it's not prime
    return false #return false
  else
    for i in [2..number-1] #loop through all numbers from 2 to n-1 
      if ((number % i) === 0) #if number is divisible by i, it's not prime
        return false #return false
  return true #if no factors are found, return true (number is prime)

#function to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given number
generatePrimeList = (limit) ->
  primeList = [] #initialize array to hold prime numbers
  for i in [2..limit] #loop through all numbers from 2 to limit
    if isPrime(i) #call function isPrime to check if number is prime
      primeList.push(i) #add prime number to primeList array
  return primeList #return array of prime numbers

console.log(generatePrimeList(20)) #prints [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19] to console
