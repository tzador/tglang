# This is a complex function to generate a Fibonacci sequence
# It takes in an integer as input and returns the sequence as an array

(fibonacci) =>
  # Create an empty array to store the sequence
  sequence = []

  # Base cases: 0 and 1
  sequence.push(0)
  sequence.push(1)

  # Loop through the remaining numbers starting from 2
  for i in [2..fibonacci]
    # Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
    next_num = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]

    # Push the next number to the sequence array
    sequence.push(next_num)

  # Return the sequence array
  return sequence

# Call the function with an input of 10 and store the result in a variable
result = fibonacci(10)

# Print the result to console
console.log(result)

# Output:
# [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
