# Assigns a function to a variable

# Function that takes in an array and performs a callback on each element
map = (array, callback) ->
  # Creates a new array to store the results
  results = []

  # Loops through each element in the array
  for item in array
    # Calls the callback function on the current element and adds the result to the results array
    results.push(callback(item))
  
  # Returns the new results array

# An example list of numbers to test the map function with
numbers = [2, 5, 8, 11]

# Calls the map function with the numbers array and the previously defined function as the callback
mappedNumbers = map(numbers, someFunc)

# Prints the result of the mapped numbers array
console.log(mappedNumbers)  # Output: [20, 50, 80, 110]
