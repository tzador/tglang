# Defining a variable and assigning a value
myVariable = 20

# Defining a function with parameters
myFunction = (param1, param2) ->
  # Performing a calculation
  result = param1 + param2
  # Returning the result
  return result

# Creating an object with properties and methods
myObject = {
  property1: "hello",
  property2: true,
  method1: () ->
    # Performing a string interpolation
    console.log "The property1 value is #{myObject.property1}"
}

# Declaring a class with a constructor and methods
class MyClass
  constructor: (param) ->
    # Assigning a parameter to a property
    @property = param
  method1: () ->
    # Accessing the property and performing a check
    if @property == "changed"
      console.log "The property has been changed"
    else
      console.log "The property has not been changed"

# Creating an array
myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Looping through the array and performing an action on each element
for num in myArray
  # Squaring the number
  squared = num * num
  # Printing the squared value
  console.log squared

# Using the fat arrow to maintain the proper context
myObject.method1 = =>
  # Accessing the object's properties within the function
  console.log "The property2 value is #{@property2}"

# Calling the function with arguments
myFunction(10, 5)
# Output: 15

# Creating a template string
templateString = "The value of myVariable is #{myVariable}"
# Output: The value of myVariable is 20

# Instantiating the class and calling methods
myClassInstance = new MyClass("initial")
# Calling method1
myClassInstance.method1()
# Output: The property has not been changed

# Reassigning the property value
myClassInstance.property = "changed"
# Calling method1 again
myClassInstance.method1()
# Output: The property has been changed
