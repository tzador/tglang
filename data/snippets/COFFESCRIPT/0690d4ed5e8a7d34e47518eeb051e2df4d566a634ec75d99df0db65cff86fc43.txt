class Vehicle
  # Define a class called Vehicle
  constructor: (make, model, year) ->
    # Create a constructor function that takes in make, model, and year as parameters
    @make = make
    # Assign the passed in make value to the make property of the object (using the @ symbol to refer to the object itself)
    @model = model
    # Assign the passed in model value to the model property of the object
    @year = year
    # Assign the passed in year value to the year property of the object

  drive: ->
    # Create a method called drive that does not take in any parameters
    console.log "Driving a #{@make} #{@model} from #{@year}."
    # Output a string with the values of the make, model, and year properties of the object using string interpolation and the console.log() function

myCar = new Vehicle("Honda", "Civic", 2020)
# Create a new instance of the Vehicle class called myCar, passing in the values "Honda", "Civic", and 2020 to the constructor function as arguments

myCar.drive()
# Call the drive method on the myCar object, which will print out "Driving a Honda Civic from 2020."
