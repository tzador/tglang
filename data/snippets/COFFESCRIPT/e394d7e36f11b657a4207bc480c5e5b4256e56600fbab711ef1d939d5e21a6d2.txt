# This is a function that takes in a number and 
# checks if it is prime.
primeChecker = (num) ->
  # If the number is less than 2, it is not prime.
  if num < 2
    return false

  # Loop through numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number.
  for i in [2..Math.sqrt(num)]
    # If the given number is divisible by any of the numbers in the loop,
    # it is not prime.
    if num % i is 0
      return false

  # If none of the numbers in the loop divide the given number,
  # then it is prime.
  return true

# Example usage of the primeChecker function.
# Pass in a number as an argument and print out the result.
number = 11
console.log(primeChecker(number)) # Output: true
