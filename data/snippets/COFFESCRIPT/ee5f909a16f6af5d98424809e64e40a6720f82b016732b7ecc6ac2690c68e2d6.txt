## Function to calculate the factorial of a number
calculateFactorial = (num) ->
    ## Checking if number is negative
    if num < 0
        ## Returning error message
        return "Error: Factorial cannot be calculated for negative numbers."

    ## Checking if number is 0 or 1
    else if num == 0 or num == 1
        ## Returning 1
        return 1
    
    ## Declaring variable to store factorial
    fact = 1

    ## Looping through numbers from 2 to num 
    ## and multiplying them with the factorial variable
    for i in [2..num] by 1
        fact = fact * i
    
    ## Returning the factorial value
    return fact

## Printing the factorial of 5 
console.log(calculateFactorial(5))
