# Define a function called "calculate_price" that takes in two parameters: "item" and "quantity"
# Notation: This function will calculate the total price of a given item based on its quantity
calculate_price = (item, quantity) ->
  # Define a switch statement based on the value of the "item" parameter
  switch item

    when "coffee"

      coffee_price = quantity * 5

      console.log("The total price of #{quantity} cups of coffee is #{coffee_price}!")
    # If the item is "croissant"
    when "croissant"
      # Calculate the price of croissant based on its unit price and quantity
      croissant_price = quantity * 3
      # Print a message with the total price of croissant
      console.log("The total price of #{quantity} croissants is #{croissant_price}!")
    # If the item is "bagel"
    when "bagel"
      # Calculate the price of bagel based on its unit price and quantity
      bagel_price = quantity * 2.5
      # Print a message with the total price of bagel
      console.log("The total price of #{quantity} bagels is #{bagel_price}!")
    # If the item is not one of the above cases, print an error message
    else
      console.log("Item not found. Please enter a valid item.")
# Call the "calculate_price" function with "coffee" as the item and a quantity of 3
calculate_price("coffee", 3)
# Output: The total price of 3 cups of coffee is 15!
# Call the "calculate_price" function with "croissant" as the item and a quantity of 2
calculate_price("croissant", 2)
# Output: The total price of 2 croissants is 6!
# Call the "calculate_price" function with "tea" as the item and a quantity of 5
calculate_price("tea", 5)
# Output: Item not found. Please enter a valid item.
