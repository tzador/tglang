### This code snippet utilizes CoffeeScript's comprehensions ###

# Define an array of names
names = ["John", "Sarah", "Michael", "Emily", "David"]

# Use comprehensions to create a new array that contains the length of each name
nameLengths = (name.length for name in names)

# Print out the new array
console.log(nameLengths)

# Define an object with ids and corresponding names
users =
  1: "John"
  2: "Sarah"
  3: "Michael"
  4: "Emily"
  5: "David"

# Use object comprehensions to create a new object that swaps the keys and values
swappedUsers = { name: id for id, name of users }

# Print out the new object
console.log(swappedUsers)

# Define a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array with only even numbers
getEvens = (numbers) ->
  for number in numbers
    if number % 2 == 0
      number

# Print out the result of calling the function with an array of numbers
console.log(getEvens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]))

# Define a class for a person with a constructor and a method to print out their name
class Person
  constructor: (name) ->
    @name = name

  printName: ->
    console.log("My name is #{@name}")

# Create an instance of the Person class and call the printName method
person = new Person("John")
person.printName()
