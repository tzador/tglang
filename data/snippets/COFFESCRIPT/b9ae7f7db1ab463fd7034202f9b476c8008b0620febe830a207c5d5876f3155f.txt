### This is a complex function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array with only even numbers.
evenNumbers = (arr) ->
  # Initialize empty array to store even numbers
  newArray = []
  
  # Loop through input array
  for num in arr
    # Check if number is even
    if (num % 2) == 0
      # Push number to new array
      newArray.push num
  
  # Return new array
  return newArray
  
# Call function and print output
console.log(evenNumbers([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]))
