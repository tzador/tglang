# This is a function that calculates and returns the factorial of a given number
factorial = (num) ->
  result = 1 # initialize result to 1
  for i in [1..num] # loop through numbers from 1 to num
    result *= i # calculate result by multiplying it with current number in loop
  result # return the final result
