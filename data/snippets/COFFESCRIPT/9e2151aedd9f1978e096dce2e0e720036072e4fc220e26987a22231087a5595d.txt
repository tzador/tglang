# This code snippet generates a Fibonacci sequence using Coffeescript
# Initialize the first two numbers of the sequence
a = 0
b = 1

# Use a for loop to iterate and generate the rest of the sequence
for num in [2..10]
    # Use the sum of the previous two numbers as the next number in the sequence
    c = a + b

    # Update the values of a and b to continue the sequence
    a = b
    b = c

    # Print the current number in the sequence
    console.log(c)
