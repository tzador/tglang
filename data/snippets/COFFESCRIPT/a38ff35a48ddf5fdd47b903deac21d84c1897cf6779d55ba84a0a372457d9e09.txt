WELCOME TO COFFESCRIPT

COFFESCRIPT is a programming language that transcompiles into JavaScript. It was created to make writing JavaScript easier and more readable.

To get started with COFFESCRIPT, you can install it through npm using the command:
npm install -g coffeescript

Once installed, you can create a new COFFESCRIPT file with the .coffee extension. Let's call it "hello_world.coffee".

Now, let's write some code in our "hello_world.coffee" file:
###
greeting = "Hello, World!"
console.log(greeting)

###
This code snippet creates a variable called "greeting" and sets it to the string "Hello, World!". It then uses the console.log() function to print the value of "greeting" to the console.

To run this code, we need to transcompile it into JavaScript using the command:
coffee hello_world.coffee

This will generate a new file called "hello_world.js" with the following code:
###
var greeting;
greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);

###
As you can see, COFFESCRIPT is very similar to JavaScript, with some added features to make it more concise and readable.
