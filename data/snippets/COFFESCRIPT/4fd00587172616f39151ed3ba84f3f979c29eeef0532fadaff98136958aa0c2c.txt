# This program calculates the average of three numbers

# Define a CoffeeScript function to calculate average
average = (num1, num2, num3) ->
  total = num1 + num2 + num3 # Calculate the sum of the three numbers
  return total / 3 # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 3 and return it

# Assign values to the three numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 10
num3 = 15

# Call the average function with the three numbers as arguments
result = average(num1, num2, num3)

# Print the result
console.log("The average of", num1, ",", num2, "and", num3, "is", result)

# Output:
# The average of 5, 10 and 15 is 10
