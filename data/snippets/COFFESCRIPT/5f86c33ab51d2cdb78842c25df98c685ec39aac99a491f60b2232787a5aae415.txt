### This example code snippet is written in CoffeeScript ###
# Define a function that takes in two parameters
multiply = (x, y) ->
# Use the implicit return to return the product of the two numbers
x * y

# Define an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use a for loop to iterate through the array
for num in numbers
# Print out the product of the current number and 2
console.log(multiply(num, 2))
