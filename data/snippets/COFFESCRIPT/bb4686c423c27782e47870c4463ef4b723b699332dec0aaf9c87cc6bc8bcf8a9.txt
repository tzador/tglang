### Explanation: The following code snippet creates a "Person" class with two properties: "name" and "age". It also includes a method called "greet" which uses the person's name to print a greeting.###

class Person
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age
  
  greet: ->
    console.log("Hello #{@name}! I see you are #{@age} years old.")

###Example:###

#Create a new person instance
newPerson = new Person("John", 25)

#Call the greet method
newPerson.greet() 

#Output: Hello John! I see you are 25 years old.
