###Function to calculate the factorial of a given number
calculateFactorial = (num) ->
  if num < 0                              #Check if the number is negative
    console.log("Invalid input")
    return null                         #Return null if input is invalid
  
  factorial = 1                           #Initialize factorial variable to store result
  for i in [1..num]                       #Loop from 1 to given number
    factorial *= i                        #Multiply factorial by current number
  return factorial                        #Return calculated factorial

console.log(calculateFactorial(5))        #Print the factorial of 5 (should be 120)
