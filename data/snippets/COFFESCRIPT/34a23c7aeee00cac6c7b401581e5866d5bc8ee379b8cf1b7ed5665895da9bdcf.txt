# This code snippet is a function that takes in an array of numbers and outputs the sum of all the numbers
# First, we define the function and give it a name
sumOfNumbers = (array) ->
  # Set the initial value of the sum variable to 0
  sum = 0
  # Loop through the input array using the for loop
  for number in array
    # Add the current number to the sum variable
    sum += number
  
  # Return the sum as the output of the function
  sum
# Call the function with an example array as the argument
console.log(sumOfNumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
