# Define a class called Person with a constructor that takes in two parameters: name and age
class Person
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age
    
# Create a new instance of the Person class with name set to "John" and age set to 25
person = new Person("John", 25)

# Define a function called greet that takes in a person object and prints out a greeting message
greet = (person) ->
  console.log("Hello " + person.name + ", you are " + person.age + " years old.")

# Call the greet function with the person object as the argument
greet(person)

# Define a class called Student that extends the Person class
class Student extends Person
  constructor: (name, age, major) ->
    super(name, age)
    @major = major
    
# Create a new instance of the Student class with name set to "Jane", age set to 20, and major set to "Computer Science"
student = new Student("Jane", 20, "Computer Science")

# Call the greet function with the student object as the argument, which will also print out the major
greet(student)
