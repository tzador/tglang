# This code snippet shows how to create and manipulate objects in Coffeescript
# Declare a class called Person
class Person
  constructor: (@name, @age, @occupation) ->
    # The constructor method creates an object with properties name, age, and occupation
    # The `@` symbol refers to the current object in Coffeescript

  # Add a method to the Person class called greet
  greet: ->
    # Use Coffeescript string interpolation to print out a greeting
    console.log "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  
  # Add a method to the Person class called changeJob
  changeJob: (newJob) ->
    # Use Coffeescript string concatenation to print out a message showing the old and new occupation
    console.log "I used to be a #{@occupation}, but now I am a " + newJob + "."
  
# Create a new object called joe and pass in values for name, age, and occupation
joe = new Person("Joe", 30, "teacher")

# Call the greet method on the joe object
joe.greet()
# Output: Hello, my name is Joe and I am 30 years old.

# Call the changeJob method on the joe object and pass in a new value for occupation
joe.changeJob("writer")
# Output: I used to be a teacher, but now I am a writer.
