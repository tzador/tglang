# This is a basic CoffeeScript example with a function and an if statement
# Function that takes in two numbers and adds them together
add = (x, y) ->
    sum = x + y
    # Check if the sum is greater than 10
    if sum > 10
        console.log("The sum is greater than 10")
    else
        console.log("The sum is less than or equal to 10")
    
# Call the function with two numbers and see the output
add(3, 8) # Output: "The sum is greater than 10"
