### This program generates a fibonacci sequence up to a given limit ###

# Define a function that takes in a limit parameter
fibonacci = (limit) ->
  
  # Initialize an array to store the sequence
  sequence = []
  
  # Add the first two numbers of the sequence (0 and 1)
  sequence.push(0)
  sequence.push(1)
  
  # Loop through until the limit is reached
  i = 2
  while i < limit
    # Calculate the next number and add it to the sequence
    nextNumber = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]
    sequence.push(nextNumber)
    
    # Increment the loop variable
    i++
    
  # Finally, return the generated sequence
  return sequence
  
# Call the fibonacci function with a limit of 10
fibonacci(10)
