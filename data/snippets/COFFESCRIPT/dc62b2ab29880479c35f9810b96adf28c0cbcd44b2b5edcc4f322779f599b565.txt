# This is a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns their sum
sum = (numbers) ->
  total = 0 # initializing total variable
  for num in numbers
    total += num # increment total by current number
  return total # return the sum

# This function reverses a string
reverseString = (str) ->
  reversed = "" # initializing an empty string
  for i in [str.length - 1..0] # looping through indices of the string in reverse order
    reversed += str[i] # add character at current index to reversed string
