##This code snippet creates a class named "Person"##

class Person
  constructor: (@name, @age) ->
    # Assigns name and age when class is instantiated


  # Defines a method called "introduce" which logs the name and age
  # of the person
  introduce: ->
    console.log "#{@name} is #{@age} years old"

  # Defines a method called "celebrateBirthday" which increments
  # the person's age by 1 and logs a birthday message
  celebrateBirthday: ->
    @age++
    console.log "#{@name} is now #{@age} years old and celebrating a birthday!"

# Creates a new instance of the Person class with name "John" and age 30
john = new Person("John", 30)

# Calls the "introduce" method on the "john" instance
john.introduce() # Output: "John is 30 years old"

# Calls the "celebrateBirthday" method on the "john" instance
john.celebrateBirthday() # Output: "John is now 31 years old and celebrating a birthday!"
