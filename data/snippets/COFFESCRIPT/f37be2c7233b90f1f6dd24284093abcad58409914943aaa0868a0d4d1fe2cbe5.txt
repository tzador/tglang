# This code snippet is a function in CoffeeScript that calculates the factorial of a given number.

factorial = (num) ->
  # The base case: if the number is 0 or 1, return 1
  if num is 0 or num is 1
    return 1
  # Otherwise, recursively calculate the factorial by multiplying the number with the factorial of (num-1)
  else
    return num * factorial(num-1)

# A helper function to print the factorial of a given number
printFactorial = (num) ->
  console.log("The factorial of #{num} is #{factorial(num)}")

# Example calls to the printFactorial function
printFactorial(5) # Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
printFactorial(8) # Output: The factorial of 8 is 40320

# Note: In CoffeeScript, the '->' syntax denotes a function, 'is' is the equivalent of '===' and strings can be interpolated using #{}
