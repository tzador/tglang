# Function that takes in an array and returns the sum of its elements
(array) ->
  # Initialize variable to store sum
  sum = 0

  # Loop through array elements and add to sum
  for i in array
    sum += i
  
  # Return the sum
  sum

# Function that takes in a string and reverse its characters
(string) ->
  # Initialize empty string to store reversed string
  reversed = ''

  # Loop through string characters in reverse order and add to reversed string
  for char in string.charAt(0)..string.charAt(string.length - 1) by -1
    reversed += char
  
  # Return the reversed string
  reversed

# Function that calculates the factorial of a number
# Using recursive approach
(factorial) ->
  # Base case: if number is 0 or 1, factorial is 1
  if factorial is 0 or factorial is 1
    1
  else
    # Recursive case: factorial of number is number multiplied by factorial of (number - 1)
    factorial * factorial(factorial - 1)
