# This is a complex code snippet in CoffeeScript

# Declare a variable called "name" and set it equal to "John"
name = "John"

# Define a function called "greeting" with one parameter "name"
greeting = (name) ->
	# Create a string variable "message" and concatenate it with the parameter "name"
	message = "Hello " + name + "!"

	# Print the message
	console.log message

# Call the function and pass in the "name" variable
greeting(name)

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

# Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers list
for num in numbers
	# Check if the number is even
	if num % 2 == 0
		# If it is even, print "Even" followed by the number
		console.log "Even " + num
	else
		# If it is odd, print "Odd" followed by the number
		console.log "Odd " + num

# Create a class called "Animal" with a constructor function
class Animal
	constructor: (@name, @age) ->

	# Define a method "greet" that prints a greeting with the animal's name and age
	greet: ->
		console.log "Hi! My name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."

# Create an instance of the Animal class
dog = new Animal("Rex", 3)

# Call the greet method on the dog instance
dog.greet()
