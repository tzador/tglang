# This is a CoffeeScript function that checks if a number is prime or not.

# Function to check if a number is prime
isPrime = (num) ->
  # if number is less than 2, it is not prime
  if num < 2 then return false

  # loop through all the numbers from 2 to square root of num
  for i in [2..Math.sqrt(num)]
    # if num is divisible by i, it's not prime
    if num % i is 0 then return false
  
  # if the loop completes without returning false, the number is prime
  return true

# Call the function to check if a number is prime
console.log isPrime(17)
