# This is a function that takes in an array and returns the average of its elements

average = (array) ->
  # Initialize sum variable
  sum = 0
  # Loop through each element in the array
  for element in array
    # Add the element to the sum variable
    sum += element
  # Divide the sum by the length of the array to get the average
  sum / array.length

# Example array
exampleArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Call the average function and store the result in a variable
exampleAverage = average(exampleArray)

# Print the result to the console
console.log("The average of the array is: #{exampleAverage}")
