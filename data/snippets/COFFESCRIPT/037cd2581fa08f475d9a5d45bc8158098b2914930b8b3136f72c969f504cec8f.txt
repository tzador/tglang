## This is a code snippet in COFFESCRIPT.

### This snippet creates a class called 'Person' with two properties: name and age.

class Person
  constructor: (@name, @age) ->
  # the 'constructor' method is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created
  # the 'name' and 'age' parameters are set as properties of the new instance using the '@' symbol

  getName: ->
    # this method returns the name property of the instance
    @name

  getAge: ->
    # this method returns the age property of the instance
    @age

  setName: (name) ->
    # this method sets the name property of the instance to the 'name' parameter
    @name = name

  setAge: (age) ->
    # this method sets the age property of the instance to the 'age' parameter
    @age = age

### This snippet creates a new instance of the 'Person' class and sets its name and age properties.

person = new Person("John", 25)

### This snippet calls the 'getName' and 'getAge' methods on the 'person' instance and prints the returned values.

console.log(person.getName()) # output: "John"
console.log(person.getAge()) # output: 25
