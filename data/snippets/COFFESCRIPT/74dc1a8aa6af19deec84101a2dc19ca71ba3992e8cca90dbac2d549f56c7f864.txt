### The following code block defines a class called "Car" that contains properties and functions for a simple car game ###

class Car
    constructor: (@make, @model, @color, @year) ->  ## Defines the constructor function with the parameters 'make', 'model', 'color', and 'year' and assigns them as properties of the Car class

    gas: 100  ## Sets the initial gas level to 100 for the car

    drive: (distance) ->  ## Defines the drive function with the parameter 'distance'
        if distance <= this.gas  ## If the distance is less than or equal to the current gas level
            this.gas -= distance  ## Subtract the travelled distance from the gas level
            console.log("You drove #{distance} miles. Gas level is now #{this.gas}!")  ## Output message to the console with the updated gas level
        else  ## If the distance is greater than the current gas level
            console.log("Not enough gas to drive #{distance} miles!")  ## Output message to the console

    refill: ->  ## Defines the refill function
        this.gas = 100  ## Refills the gas level back to 100
        console.log("Gas level has been refilled to #{this.gas}!")  ## Output message to the console

myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", "Red", 2015)  ## Creates a new instance of the Car class with the given parameters
myCar.drive(50)  ## Calls the drive function with a distance of 50 miles, outputs "You drove 50 miles. Gas level is now 50!"
myCar.refill()  ## Calls the refill function, outputs "Gas level has been refilled to 100!"
