### This code snippet demonstrates a function that takes in two parameters ###
### and uses conditional statements and string interpolation to produce output ###

coffeeOrder = (drink, size) ->
  if drink is "latte"
    order = "A #{size} #{drink} please."
  else if drink is "cappuccino"
    order = "A #{size} #{drink} for me."
  else
    order = "Sorry, we don't have #{drink} on the menu."

console.log(coffeeOrder("latte", "large"))  ### outputs "A large latte please." ###
console.log(coffeeOrder("cappuccino", "small")) ### outputs "A small cappuccino for me." ###
console.log(coffeeOrder("mocha", "medium")) ### outputs "Sorry, we don't have mocha on the menu." ###
