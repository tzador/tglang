# Triple backticks denote a code block in Markdown

# Define a function that takes in two parameters
square = (x, y) ->
  # Multiply the two parameters and assign it to a new variable
  result = x * y
  # Return the squared result
  return result ** 2

# Create an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers
for num in numbers
  # Call the square function with the current number as the first parameter
  # and the length of the numbers array as the second parameter
  # Assign the squared result to a new variable
  squared = square(num, numbers.length)
  # Print the squared result to the console
  console.log(squared)

# Define a class called Dog
class Dog
  # Constructor method that takes in a name and age
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    # Assign the name and age to instance variables
    @name = name
    @age = age

  # Define a method that will output the dog's name and age
  sayInfo: ->
    console.log("My name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old.")

# Create a new instance of the Dog class
dog1 = new Dog("Buddy", 5)
# Call the sayInfo method on the dog1 instance
dog1.sayInfo()

# Add a new property to the dog1 instance
dog1.breed = "Golden Retriever"

# Define a class called Cat that extends the Dog class
class Cat extends Dog
  # Override the sayInfo method to output a different message
  sayInfo: ->
    console.log("I am a cat and my name is #{@name}.")

# Create a new instance of the Cat class
cat1 = new Cat("Whiskers", 3)
# Call the sayInfo method on the cat1 instance
cat1.sayInfo()

# Define a function that takes in an array and a callback
# The callback function will be called on each element of the array
# and the result will be stored in a new array
map = (array, callback) ->
  # Define an empty array to store the results
  results = []
  # Use a for loop to iterate through the array
  for element in array
    # Call the callback function with the current element as the parameter
    # and store the result in a new variable
    result = callback(element)
    # Push the result to the results array
    results.push(result)
  # Return the results array
  return results

# Create a new array with numbers
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Call the map function with the array and a callback function
# The callback function will multiply each element by 2
doubled = map(array, (num) -> num * 2)

# Print the doubled array to the console
console.log(doubled)
