# This function calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list

# Define a function that takes in a list as its parameter
getEvenSum = (list) ->
  # Initialize a variable to hold the sum
  sum = 0
  # Loop through the list
  for num in list
    # Check if the number is even
    if num % 2 is 0
      # Add the number to the sum
      sum += num
  # Return the sum
  return sum

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Call the function and assign the output to a variable
evenSum = getEvenSum(numbers)

# Output the result
console.log("The sum of all even numbers in the list is: #{evenSum}")
