### Example of a nested for loop ###

# Declare an array of objects
users = [
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 25,
    city: "New York"
  },
  {
    name: "Jane Smith",
    age: 32,
    city: "Los Angeles"
  },
  {
    name: "Tom Brown",
    age: 18,
    city: "Chicago"
  }
]

# Define a function to loop through the array
loop_function = ->
  # Loop through each user object in the array
  for user in users
    # Print out the user's name
    console.log("Name: " + user.name)
    # Loop through each key-value pair in the user object
    for key, value of user
      # Print out the key-value pair
      console.log(key + ": " + value)

# Call the function
loop_function()
