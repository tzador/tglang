# Annotated Markdown Code Snippet in Coffeescript
# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion
# Function takes in a number as a parameter
factorial = (num) ->
  # Base case: If number equals 1, return 1
  if num is 1
    return 1
  # Recursive case: Multiply number by the factorial of (number - 1)
  else
    return num * factorial(num - 1)
# Call the function and pass in a number to calculate its factorial
factorial(5)
# Output: 120 (since 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)
