# This code snippet is an example of how to create a class in CoffeeScript

class Animal
    constructor: (@name, @age, @species) ->
        # The constructor initializes the instance variables of the class

    speak: () ->
        # This method defines the behavior of the Animal class to speak
        console.log("Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am a #{@species} at the age of #{@age}.")

# Create a new instance of the Animal class
animal = new Animal("Buddy", 5, "dog")

# Call the speak method on the animal instance
animal.speak()

# Output:
# Hello, my name is Buddy and I am a dog at the age of 5.
