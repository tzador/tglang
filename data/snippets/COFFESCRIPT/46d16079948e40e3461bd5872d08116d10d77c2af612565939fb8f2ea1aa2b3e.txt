# Here we define a class called "Person" with attributes "name" and "age".
class Person
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age

# This is a method within the "Person" class that returns the person's name.
  getName: ->
    @name

# This is a method within the "Person" class that returns the person's age.
  getAge: ->
    @age

# Here we create a new instance of the "Person" class with the name "John" and age 30.
john = new Person("John", 30)

# This will print "John" to the console by calling the "getName" method on the "john" instance.
console.log(john.getName())

# This will print 30 to the console by calling the "getAge" method on the "john" instance.
console.log(john.getAge())

# We can also set new values for the attributes of the "john" instance.
john.name = "Johnny"
john.age = 25

# This will now print "Johnny" and 25 to the console by calling the "getName" and "getAge" methods on the "john" instance.
console.log(john.getName())
