# Function for finding the common elements in two arrays
findCommonElements = (array1, array2) ->
  # Takes each element from array1 and checks if it is present in array2
  for element in array1
    if array2.indexOf(element) > -1
      # If found, prints the element and its index position in array2
      console.log "#{element} found at index #{array2.indexOf(element)} in #{array2}"
    else
      # If not found, prints that the element is not present in array2
      console.log "#{element} not found in #{array2}"

# Array with some common elements
array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Array with some of the same common elements as array1
array2 = [3, 4, 7, 8, 9]

# Call the findCommonElements function
findCommonElements(array1, array2)

# Output:
# 3 found at index 0 in [3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
# 4 found at index 1 in [3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
# 5 not found in [3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
