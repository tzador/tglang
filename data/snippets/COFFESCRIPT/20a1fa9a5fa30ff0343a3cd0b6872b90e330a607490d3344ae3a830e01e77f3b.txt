###
Function to sort a given array of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm
###
bubbleSort = (arr) ->
  swapped = true # variable to keep track if any elements have been swapped in current iteration
  while swapped
    swapped = false
    for i in [0...arr.length-1] # loop through array from index 0 to second last index
      if arr[i] > arr[i+1] # if current element is greater than next element
        temp = arr[i] # swap elements
        arr[i] = arr[i+1]
        arr[i+1] = temp
        swapped = true # set swapped to true to continue iterating
  return arr # return sorted array
