# A snippet of CoffeeScript code that creates a class called 'Person' with two properties and a method
class Person
    constructor: (name, age) ->
        @name = name
        @age = age
    sayHello: ->
        console.log "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
        
# Instantiate a new Person object with a name and age
p = new Person("John", 30)

# Call the sayHello method on the object
p.sayHello()

# Output:
# Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
