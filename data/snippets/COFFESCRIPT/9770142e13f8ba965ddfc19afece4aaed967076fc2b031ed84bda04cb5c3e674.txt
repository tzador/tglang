# This is a function that takes in an array as a parameter and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.

sumArray = (arr) ->
    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the array, adding each element to the sum
    for num in arr
        sum += num
    # Return the sum
    return sum

# Example call with an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sumArray(numbers)
console.log(result) # Output: 15

# Example call with an array of strings (will not work)
words = ["hello", "world"]
result = sumArray(words)
console.log(result) # Output: 0 (since strings cannot be added)
