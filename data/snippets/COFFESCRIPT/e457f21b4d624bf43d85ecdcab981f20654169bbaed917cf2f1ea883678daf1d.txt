### This code snippet uses CoffeeScript to create an object and add key-value pairs to it ###

obj = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  hobbies: ["playing guitar", "hiking"],
  location: {
    city: "New York",
    state: "New York"
  }
}

# The object above has four key-value pairs: name, age, hobbies, and location. The location
# key has an object assigned to it with two additional key-value pairs: city and state.

# To add a new key-value pair to the object, we can use the dot notation and assignment operator.

obj.pet = "dog"

# The object now has a new key-value pair: pet, with the value "dog".

# To access the values of a key, we can use the dot notation again.

console.log(obj.name) # Output: John

# We can also use bracket notation to access values, especially if the key has special characters.

console.log(obj["location"]["state"]) # Output: New York
