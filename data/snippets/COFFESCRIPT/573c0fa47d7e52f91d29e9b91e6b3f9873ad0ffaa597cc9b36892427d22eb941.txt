# A function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers
# @param {Array} numArr - array of numbers
# @returns {Number} - sum of even numbers

  for num in numArr
    if num % 2 == 0 # checks if number is even
      sum += num # adds even numbers to sum variable
  return sum  # returns sum of even numbers
