# Annotated COFFESCRIPT Code Snippet

# Define a function called `calculateSum` that takes in two parameters, `num1` and `num2`
calculateSum = (num1, num2) ->
  # Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of the two numbers
  sum = num1 + num2
  
  # If the sum is greater than 10, divide it by 2 and return the result
  if sum > 10
    return sum / 2
  # If the sum is less than or equal to 10, multiply it by 3 and return the result
  else
    return sum * 3
  
  # This is the end of our function, the result will be automatically returned

# Call the function `calculateSum` with parameters 5 and 7
# Expected output: 18
calculateSum(5, 7)

# Call the function `calculateSum` with parameters 12 and 3
# Expected output: 7.5
calculateSum(12, 3)
