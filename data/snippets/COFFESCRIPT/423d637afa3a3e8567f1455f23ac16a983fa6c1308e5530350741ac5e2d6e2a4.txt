# A complex function that creates a new array from two given arrays, with elements that are only found in one of the arrays

arr1 = [3, 7, 9, 12, 15]
arr2 = [3, 6, 10, 12, 18, 21]

# Function that takes in two arrays and returns a new array with unique elements from both
uniqueElements = (array1, array2) ->

  # Initialize an empty array to store new unique elements
  newArray = []

  # Loop through first array
  for element in array1

    # Check if element is not present in second array
    if !(element in array2)

      # Add element to new array
      newArray.push(element)

  # Loop through second array
  for element in array2

    # Check if element is not present in first array
    if !(element in array1)

      # Add element to new array
      newArray.push(element)

  # Return new array with unique elements
  return newArray

# Call function and pass in both arrays
uniqueArray = uniqueElements(arr1, arr2)

# Print result to console
console.log(uniqueArray)
