# Function to find average of a given array
avg = (arr) ->
 sum  = 0 # variable to store the sum of array elements
 for i in arr
   sum += i # add each element to the sum
 return sum / arr.length # return the average by dividing sum by number of elements

# Sample array
myArray = [23, 16, 8, 42, 9]

# Call the average function and store the result in a variable
myAverage = avg(myArray)

# Print the result
console.log("The average of the array is: #{myAverage}")
