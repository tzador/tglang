### A complex function that calculates the average age of a group of people ###
calculateAverageAge = (people) ->
  # initialize variable to hold total age
  totalAge = 0
  # iterate through each person in the group
  for person in people
    # add their age to the total
    totalAge += person.age
  # divide total age by the number of people to get average
  averageAge = totalAge / people.length
  # return average age
  return averageAge
  
# create an array of person objects with age property
people = [{ name: "John", age: 25 }, { name: "Jane", age: 32 }, { name: "Bob", age: 40 }]

# call the calculateAverageAge function with the array as an argument
averageAge = calculateAverageAge(people)

# print the average age to the console
console.log("The average age is " + averageAge + " years old.")
