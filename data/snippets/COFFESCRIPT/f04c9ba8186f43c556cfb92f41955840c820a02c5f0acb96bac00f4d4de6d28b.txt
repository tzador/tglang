# Here we define a function that takes in an array of numbers as input
# and returns the sum of all the values in that array.
sum = (numbers) ->
  total = 0
  # Loop through each number in the array and add it to the total
  for num in numbers
    total += num
  # Return the final total
  return total

# Example input
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Call the sum function and store the result in a variable
total = sum(nums)
# Print the result
console.log("The total sum is #{total}")
