# Create a function that takes in two numbers and returns the difference between the sum of their squares and the square of their difference
square_diff = (num1, num2) ->
    # Calculate the sum of squares
    sum_of_squares = num1 * num1 + num2 * num2
    # Calculate the difference of squares
    diff_of_squares = (num1 - num2) * (num1 + num2)
    # Return the difference between the two
    return sum_of_squares - (diff_of_squares * diff_of_squares)

# Example usage
result = square_diff(5, 3)
# Expected output: 40
