# This code snippet is a function that takes in a string and returns the number of vowels in the string.

# Define a function named "countVowels" that takes in one parameter, "string"
countVowels = (string) ->

  # Set a counter variable to keep track of number of vowels
  vowels = 0

  # Convert the string to lowercase for easier comparison
  string = string.toLowerCase()

  # Loop through each character in the string
  for character in string

    # Check if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u)
    if character in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

      # Increment the vowel counter by 1
      vowels++

  # Return the number of vowels
  return vowels

# Call the function with a sample string and print the result
console.log(countVowels("Hello World!"))

# Output:
# 3
