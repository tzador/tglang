# Sample Coffeescript code snippet
# This code uses arrow functions and string interpolation syntax

# Create an array of objects
testArr = [
  {name: "John", age: 25},
  {name: "Mary", age: 30},
  {name: "Bob", age: 22},
  {name: "Alice", age: 28}
]

# Filter the array to only include objects with age greater than 25
filteredArr = testArr.filter((item) => item.age > 25)

# Create a function to return a greeting message with the name and age of a person
greet = (name, age) ->
  # Use string interpolation to create the message
  `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`

# Loop through the filtered array and use the greet function to create a message for each person
for item in filteredArr
  console.log(greet(item.name, item.age))

# Output:
# Hello, my name is Mary and I am 30 years old.
# Hello, my name is Alice and I am 28 years old.
