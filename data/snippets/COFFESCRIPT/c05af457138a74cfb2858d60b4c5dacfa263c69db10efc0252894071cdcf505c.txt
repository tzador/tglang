### This is a function that generates a random number between two given numbers
### It takes in a minimum value and a maximum value as parameters
### The output is a random number between the two given values
generateRandomNumber = (min, max) ->
  # First we check if the minimum value is greater than the maximum value
  if min > max
    # If it is, we swap them so that the minimum becomes the maximum and vice versa
    [min, max] = [max, min]
  
  # We get the range of numbers between the minimum and maximum values
  range = max - min
  
  # We generate a random number between 0 and 1
  randomNumber = Math.random()
  
  # We multiply the random number by the range and then add the minimum value
  # This ensures that the random number falls within the range and not just between 0 and 1
  randomNumberInRange = randomNumber * range + min
  
  # We return the final random number
  return randomNumberInRange

# Call the function and assign the output to a variable
randomNumber = generateRandomNumber(1, 10)

# Print the generated random number
console.log(randomNumber)
