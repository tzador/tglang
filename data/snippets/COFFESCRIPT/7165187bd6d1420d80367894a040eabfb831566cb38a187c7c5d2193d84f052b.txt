# An example of a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
factorial = (num) ->
  return 1 if num == 0 # Return 1 if the number is 0 to avoid an infinite loop
  result = 1 # Initialize a variable to hold the result
  while num >= 1 # Loop until the number is greater than or equal to 1
    result = result * num # Multiply the result by the current number
    num-- # Decrement the number by 1
  return result # Return the final result
console.log(factorial(5)) # Print the factorial of 5, which should be 120
