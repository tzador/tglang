# This is a CoffeeScript function that calculates the factorial of a given number

# Define a function called factorial that takes in a number parameter
factorial = (number) ->
  # Base case: if number is equal to 0, return 1
  if number is 0
    return 1
  # Recursive case: call factorial function with number minus 1 and multiply it with the number
  else
    return number * factorial(number - 1)

# Call the factorial function with a number as an argument and store the result in a variable
factorial_result = factorial(5)

# Print the result to the console
console.log(factorial_result)

# Output: 120
