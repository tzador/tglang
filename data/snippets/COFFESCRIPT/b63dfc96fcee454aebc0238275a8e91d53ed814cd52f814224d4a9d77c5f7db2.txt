# Define a class named "Employee" with constructor function
class Employee
  constructor: (@name, @age, @position) ->

# Create an instance of the Employee class
employee = new Employee("John", 32, "Manager")

# Define a function that checks if an employee is eligible for a raise
checkRaise = (employee) ->
  if employee.position is "Manager" and employee.age > 30
    console.log("#{employee.name} is eligible for a raise!")

# Call the function
checkRaise(employee)

# Output: John is eligible for a raise!
