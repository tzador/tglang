# This is a coffeeScript function to calculate the factorial of a number

factorial = (num) ->
  # checks if the number is 0 or 1, if so returns 1
  if (num == 0 || num == 1)
    return 1
  else
    # creates a variable to store the factorial value
    fact = 1
    # using a for loop to continuously multiply the number by the previous number until it reaches num
    for i in [1..num]
      fact = fact * i
    # returns the final factorial value
    return fact

# We can call the function with any number and it will return the factorial value
factorial(5)

# Output: 120 (which is the factorial value of 5)
