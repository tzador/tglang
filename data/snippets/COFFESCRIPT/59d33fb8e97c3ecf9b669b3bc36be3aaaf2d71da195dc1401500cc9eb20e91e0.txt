###CoffeeScript Code Snippet
# Create a class
class Animal
constructor: (@name) ->

# Add a static property
Animal.sound = "Roar!"

# Add a class method
Animal::makeSound = -> console.log(@sound)

# Inherit from the Animal class
class Lion extends Animal
  constructor: (@name) ->
    # Call the parent constructor with super()
    super(name)

# Create an instance of the Lion class
lion = new Lion("Simba")

# Call the makeSound method on the lion instance
lion.makeSound()
