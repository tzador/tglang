### Declaring a Class
class Animal
  constructor: (@name) ->
    @age = 0
    @species = "unknown"

  # method that updates the animal's age
  updateAge: (years) ->
    @age += years

  # method that returns the animal's name
  getName: () ->
    @name

  # method that returns the animal's species
  getSpecies: () ->
    @species

  # method that updates the animal's species
  updateSpecies: (newSpecies) ->
    @species = newSpecies

### Creating an Instance of the Class
# create an instance of the Animal class with name "Max"
animal = new Animal("Max")

# call the updateAge method to increase Max's age by 2 years
animal.updateAge(2)

# call the updateSpecies method to change Max's species to "dog"
animal.updateSpecies("dog")

### Outputting Information About the Animal
# print the animal's name and species
console.log("Name: " + animal.getName() + ", Species: " + animal.getSpecies())

# print the animal's age
console.log("Age: " + animal.age)
