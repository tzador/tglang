# Creating a class for a Person object
class Person
  constructor: (@name, @age) ->

# Creating a subclass for a Student object that inherits from Person
class Student extends Person
  constructor: (@name, @age, @major) ->

  # Method to override the toString() function to return information about the student
  toString: ->
    return "Name: #{@name}, Age: #{@age}, Major: #{@major}"

# Creating a new instance of Student
student1 = new Student("John", 21, "Computer Science")

# Printing out information about the student
console.log(student1.toString())

# Creating a function to calculate the average grade of a given list of grades
calculateAverageGrade = (grades) ->
  sum = 0

  # Using a for loop to iterate through each grade in the list
  for grade in grades
    sum += grade
  
  # Returning the average grade
  return sum / grades.length

# Creating a list of grades
grades = [85, 90, 95, 80, 75]

# Calling the calculateAverageGrade function and storing the result in a variable
average = calculateAverageGrade(grades)

# Printing out the result
console.log("Average grade: #{average}")

# Creating a function that takes in a callback function
doSomething = (callback) ->
  # Calling the callback function inside the doSomething function
  callback()

# Creating a function to be used as the callback
sayHello = ->
  console.log("Hello!")

# Calling the doSomething function and passing in the sayHello function as the callback
doSomething(sayHello)
