sum = (numbers) ->
  # Initializing a variable to store the sum
  total = 0
  # Looping through each number in the array
  for num in numbers
    # Adding the current number to the total
    total += num
  # Returning the sum
  return total

# Example usage of the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum(numbers)
console.log(result) # Output: 15
