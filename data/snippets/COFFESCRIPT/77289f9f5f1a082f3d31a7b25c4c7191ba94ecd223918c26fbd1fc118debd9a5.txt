# This is a CoffeeScript code snippet with loops and arrays.
# The snippet creates and prints an array containing the numbers 1-10.
# It then uses a for loop to print out each number in the array.

arr = [] # initializing empty array
for num in [1..10] # using range function to create array
  arr.push num # adding each number to array
for num in arr # using for loop to iterate through array
  console.log(num) # printing each number in array to console
