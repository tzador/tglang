# Define a function that takes in two parameters, a and b
multiply = (a, b) ->
  # Set c equal to the product of a and b
  c = a * b
  # Return the value of c multiplied by 2
  return c * 2

# Invoke the function with the arguments 8 and 4
result = multiply(8, 4)

# Print the result to the console
console.log(result)
