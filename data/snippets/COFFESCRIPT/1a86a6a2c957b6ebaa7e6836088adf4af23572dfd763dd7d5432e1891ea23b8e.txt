# This is a complex function that takes in two parameters, a number and a string.
# It will return a for loop that prints out each character in the string the number of times specified.
(e, str) ->
  for i in [1..e]
    # This for loop will iterate through the specified range of numbers.
    print "Iteration #{i}:"
    # This line will print out the current iteration number.
    for j in [1..str.length]
      # This for loop will iterate through the characters of the string.
      print "#{str[j-1]}".repeat(i)
      # This line will print out the current character of the string, repeated the number of times specified by the outer loop.
