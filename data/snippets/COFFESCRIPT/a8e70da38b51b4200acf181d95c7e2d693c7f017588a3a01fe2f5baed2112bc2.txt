###
CoffeeScript is a programming language that compiles into JavaScript.
It is a simple and elegant language with a syntax inspired by Ruby and Python.
In this code snippet, we will create a class called "Animal" with properties and methods.
###

# Define Animal class with constructor
class Animal
  constructor: (@name, @age) -> # constructor assigns arguments to properties

  # Define getAge method to return animal's age
  getAge: ->
    @age # @ refers to the current instance, similar to `this` in JavaScript

  # Define makeNoise method to log a message with the animal's name
  makeNoise: ->
    console.log "#{@name} makes a noise."

# Create an instance of Animal with name "Fluffy" and age 5
animal = new Animal("Fluffy", 5)

# Call getAge method on animal instance and log the returned age
console.log animal.getAge()

# Call makeNoise method on animal instance
animal.makeNoise()
