# Annotation: This code snippet is written in COFFESCRIPT and demonstrates a complex object creation using anonymous functions and closures.

class Rectangle
  constructor: (length, width) ->
    @length = length
    @width = width
  
  getArea: ->
    @length * @width
  
  getPerimeter: ->
    2 * (@length + @width)

# Anonymous function that creates a new instance of the Rectangle class with a length of 5 and a width of 10.
rect = new Rectangle(5, 10)

# Closure function that calculates the area of the rectangle
area = (rectangle) ->
  rectangle.getArea()

# Closure function that calculates the perimeter of the rectangle
perimeter = (rectangle) ->
  rectangle.getPerimeter()

# Output the area and perimeter of the rectangle object created using the anonymous function and closures.
console.log "The area of the rectangle is: #{area(rect)}"
console.log "The perimeter of the rectangle is: #{perimeter(rect)}"

# Output:
# The area of the rectangle is: 50
# The perimeter of the rectangle is: 30
