# This code snippet creates a CoffeeScript class with a constructor and two methods

# Define the class
class Book 
  constructor: (title, author, year) ->
    @title = title
    @author = author
    @year = year
  
  # Method to print book information
  printInfo: ->
    console.log "Title: #{@title}"
    console.log "Author: #{@author}"
    console.log "Year: #{@year}"
  
  # Method to update book year and print new information
  updateYear: (newYear) ->
    @year = newYear
    console.log "Updated year to: #{@year}"
    printInfo()

# Create an instance of the Book class
myBook = new Book("Harry Potter", "J.K. Rowling", 1997)

# Call methods on the instance
myBook.printInfo()
myBook.updateYear(2005)
