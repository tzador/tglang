## Map and filter example

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Define a function to filter out even numbers
isEven = (num) ->
  num % 2 == 0

# Use the filter function to get only even numbers from the list
evenNumbers = numbers.filter(isEven)

# Define a function to double each number in the list
double = (num) ->
  num * 2

# Use the map function to double each number in the list
doubledNumbers = numbers.map(double)

# Print the results
console.log(evenNumbers) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
console.log(doubledNumbers) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
