## This code snippet creates an object called 'Person' with properties 'name' and 'age'
Person =
  @name: "John" # Use the 'at' symbol to define a static variable within the object
  @age: 25
  getName: ->
    return @name # Use the fat arrow syntax to access the object's properties within a method
  setName: (newName) ->
    @name = newName
  getAge: ->
    return @age
  setAge: (newAge) ->
    @age = newAge
  introduce: ->
    console.log "Hi, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old." # Use string interpolation to print out information

## This creates an array of 'Person' objects
people = [
  new Person("Jane", 30) # Use the 'new' keyword to create a new instance of the object and pass in arguments
  new Person("Bob", 20)
]

## This loops through the array of 'Person' objects and calls the 'introduce' method on each one
for person in people
  person.introduce()
