# COFFESCRIPT is a programming language that compiles into JavaScript.
# It is known for its clean, concise syntax and powerful features.
# In this code snippet, we will implement a function that calculates the average
# of a given array of numbers.

# First, we define our average function using the fat arrow syntax.
average = (array) =>
  # Next, we use a conditional statement to check if the input is an array.
  if Array.isArray(array)
    # If it is, we use the reduce function to sum up all the numbers in the array.
    sum = array.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0)
    # We then use the length property to get the total number of items in the array.
    length = array.length
    # Finally, we return the average by dividing the sum by the length.
    sum / length
  else
    # If the input is not an array, we throw an error.
    throw new Error("Input must be an array.")

# Now, let's test our average function with a sample array.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = average(numbers)
# The result should be 3, as the average of these numbers is 3.
console.log(result)

# Output:
# 3
