# Defining a function in COFFEESCRIPT
get_total_price = (prices_array) ->
    total = 0 # Initializing total variable

    # Looping through prices array
    for price in prices_array
        total += price # Adding price to total

    return total # Returning total price

# Calling the function with an array of prices
get_total_price([10, 20, 30]) # Output: 60
