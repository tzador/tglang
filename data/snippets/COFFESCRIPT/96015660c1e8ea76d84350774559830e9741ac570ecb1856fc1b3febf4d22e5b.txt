# Create a function called "multiply" that takes in two parameters: num1 and num2
multiply = (num1, num2) ->
  # Perform the multiplication and store it in a variable called "result"
  result = num1 * num2
  # Print a message to the console with the result of the multiplication
  console.log("The multiplication of #{num1} and #{num2} is #{result}")
  # Return the result
  return result

# Call the "multiply" function with the arguments 5 and 10
multiply(5, 10)

# Output:
# The multiplication of 5 and 10 is 50
