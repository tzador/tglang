# Function to sort an array of numbers using bubble sort algorithm
sort = (arr) ->
	# Set a flag to check if any swap has been made
	swapped = true
	# Set a variable to hold the length of the array
	n = arr.length

		# Loop through the array up to second to last element
		for i in [0...n-1]

# Example usage
array = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
sorted_array = sort(array)
console.log(sorted_array) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
