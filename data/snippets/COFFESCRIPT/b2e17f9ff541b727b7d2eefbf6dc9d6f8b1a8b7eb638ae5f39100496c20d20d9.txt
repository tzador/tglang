# Define a class called Person
class Person

  # Constructor function with 'name' and 'age' as parameters
  constructor: (name, age) ->

    # Assign the 'name' parameter to instance variable 'fullName'
    @fullName = name

    # Assign the 'age' parameter to instance variable 'age'
    @age = age

  # Method to print the person's name and age
  printInfo: ->

    # Print the person's name and age

# Instantiate a new person object with 'John' as name and '25' as age
person = new Person("John", 25)

# Call the printInfo method on the person object
person.printInfo()
