# Defining a function that takes in two parameters
(addMe, subtractMe) ->
    # Declaring a global variable and setting its value
    result = 0
    
    # Looping through a range of numbers
    for num in [1..10]
        # Using conditional statement to check if number is even
        if num % 2 is 0
            # Adding value to result variable
            result += addMe
        else
            # Subtracting value from result variable
            result -= subtractMe
            
    # Returning the final result
    result
    
# Calling the function and storing its output in a variable
finalResult = addAndSubtract(5, 3)

# Printing the output
console.log(finalResult)

# Output: 10 (since we added 5 ten times and subtracted 3 five times)
