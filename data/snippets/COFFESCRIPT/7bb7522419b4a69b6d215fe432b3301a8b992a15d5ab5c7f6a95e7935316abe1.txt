# This is a CoffeeScript function with multiple parameters and a for loop

squareSum = (num1, num2, num3) ->
sum = 0
for i in [num1...num3]
sum += i*i
return sum

# The above code defines a function called 'squareSum' with three parameters of type Number
# The function uses a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers passed as parameters
# Each number is squared and added to the 'sum' variable
# Finally, the function returns the sum of all the squared numbers in the given range

# Example usage of the 'squareSum' function
result = squareSum(1, 3, 5)
console.log(result) # Output: 35

# In the above example, the function is called with parameters '1', '3' and '5'
# This will result in the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 being squared and added together
# The output will be 35, which is the sum of 1*1, 2*2, 3*3, 4*4 and 5*5
# This function can be useful for calculating the sum of squared numbers in a given range.
