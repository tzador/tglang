# This is an example of a complex code snippet in COFFESCRIPT
 
# Define a class for a car 
class Car
  # Initialize the car with properties 
  constructor: (@make, @model, @color, @year) ->

  # Define a method to drive the car 
  drive: (speed) ->
    alert "Driving at #{speed} miles per hour!"

  # Define a method to change the color of the car 
  repaint: (new_color) ->
    @color = new_color
    console.log "The car's color is now #{@color}!"

# Instantiate a new car object 
car = new Car("Tesla", "Model X", "silver", 2020)

# Call the drive method on the car 
car.drive(60)

# Call the repaint method on the car 
car.repaint("red")

# Output: 
# Driving at 60 miles per hour! 
# The car's color is now red!
