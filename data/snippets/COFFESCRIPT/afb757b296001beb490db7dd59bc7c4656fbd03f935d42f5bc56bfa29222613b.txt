# This is a function that takes in two parameters and returns the sum of both numbers
sum = (num1, num2) ->
  return num1 + num2

# This is a variable that stores an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# This is a loop that iterates through the numbers array and calls the sum function on each pair of numbers
for i in [0...numbers.length]
  result = sum(numbers[i], numbers[i+1])
  console.log(result)

# This is a conditional statement that checks if the result is greater than 10 and prints a message if true
if result > 10
  console.log("The sum is greater than 10!")
  
# This is a class declaration that creates a Person class with two properties and a method
class Person
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age
  speak: ->
    console.log("Hi, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old.")
    
# This creates a new instance of the Person class and calls the speak method
person = new Person("John", 25)
person.speak()

# This is a ternary operator that checks if the person's age is greater than 18 and returns "adult" or "minor" accordingly
status = (person.age > 18) ? "adult" : "minor"

# This is a try/catch block that attempts to divide two numbers and catches and prints any errors that occur
try
  result = 10 / 0
catch error
  console.log("Error: " + error)
  
# This is a switch statement that checks a variable and performs different actions based on its value
switch status
  when "adult"
    console.log("You are legally allowed to vote.")
  when "minor"
    console.log("You are not legally allowed to vote yet.")
  else
    console.log("Your status is undefined.")
