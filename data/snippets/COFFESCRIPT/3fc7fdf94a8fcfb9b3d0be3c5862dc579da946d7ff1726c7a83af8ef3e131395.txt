# Annotated markdown COFFESCRIPT code snippet
# This code snippet creates a class named 'Person' that takes in two parameters, 'name' and 'age'
# It has a function called 'greet' that uses a conditional to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18, and outputs different messages accordingly
class Person  
  # Constructor function with parameters 'name' and 'age'
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age
    
  # Function to greet the person depending on their age
  greet: ->
    if @age >= 18
      # Output a message for adults
      console.log "Hello #{@name}, you are an adult!"
    else
      # Output a message for minors
      console.log "Hello #{@name}, you are a minor!"
      
# Creating an instance of the Person class with name 'John' and age 20
john = new Person "John", 20

# Calling the greet function for the 'john' instance
john.greet()
