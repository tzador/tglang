# A complex code snippet in COFFESCRIPT 

# Assign a function with an array and a number as parameters
function addItemToList(list, newItem) 
  # create a for loop to check the length of the list
  for i in [0..list.length]
    # compare the current item to the new item 
    # if it is equal to 0
    if list[i] == newItem
      # print a message saying the item already exist
      console.log("Item already exists in list.")

  # add the new item to the end of the list
  list.push(newItem)

  # print a message saying the item was successfully added
  console.log("Item successfully added to list.")

# create an array called shoppingList
shoppingList = ["Apples", "Bananas", "Milk"]

# call the addItemToList function with the shoppingList as the first parameter 
# and "Eggs" as the new item
addItemToList(shoppingList, "Eggs")
