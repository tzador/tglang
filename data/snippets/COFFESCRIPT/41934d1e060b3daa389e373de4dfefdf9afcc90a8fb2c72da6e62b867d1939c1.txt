# This is a complex code snippet in CoffeeScript

# Define a function that takes in two parameters, num1 and num2
# The function returns the sum of the two numbers
sum = (num1, num2) ->
    return num1 + num2
    
# Define a variable with an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use the `forEach` method to iterate through the array
# and call the `sum` function on each element and add it to the total variable
total = 0
numbers.forEach (num) ->
    total += sum(num, 2)
    
# Print out the total variable to the console
console.log(total)

# Define a class called `Person` with two attributes, `name` and `age`
class Person
    constructor: (name, age) ->
        @name = name
        @age = age
    
    # Define a method that prints out the person's name and age
    printInfo: ->
        console.log(@name + " is " + @age + " years old.")
        
# Instantiate a new `Person` object with the name "John" and age 25
john = new Person("John", 25)

# Call the `printInfo` method on the `john` object
john.printInfo()

# Define a variable with a string
message = "Hello, World!"

# Use the `split` method to split the string into an array
words = message.split(" ")

# Use a for loop to iterate through the words array
for word in words
    # Use the `toUpperCase` method to capitalize each word
    # and print it out to the console
    console.log(word.toUpperCase())
