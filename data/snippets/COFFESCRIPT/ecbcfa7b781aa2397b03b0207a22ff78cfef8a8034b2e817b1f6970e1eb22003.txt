### This code snippet uses CoffeeScript to generate a list of numbers from 1 to 50, filtering out any numbers divisible by 3 ###

# Define a function that generates a list of numbers from 1 to 50
list_of_numbers = ->
  # Create an empty list to store the numbers in
  numbers = []
  # Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50
  for num in [1...51]
    # Check if the number is divisible by 3
    if num % 3 is 0
      # If it is divisible by 3, skip it and continue to the next number
      continue
    else
      # If it is not divisible by 3, add it to the list
      numbers.push(num)
  # Return the list of numbers
  return numbers

# Call the function and store the result in a variable
filtered_numbers = list_of_numbers()
# Print the filtered list of numbers
console.log("Numbers from 1 to 50 (excluding those divisible by 3): ", filtered_numbers)
