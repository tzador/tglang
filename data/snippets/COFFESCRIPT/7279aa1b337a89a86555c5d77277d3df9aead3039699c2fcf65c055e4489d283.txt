# Here we define a class called "Person".
class Person
    # The constructor takes in a name and age parameter and assigns them to 
    # the instance variables "this.name" and "this.age".
    constructor: (name, age) ->
        @name = name
        @age = age

    # The "greet" function prints out a greeting using the "this.name" instance variable.
    greet: () ->
        console.log "Hello there, my name is #{this.name}!"

# We create a new instance of the "Person" class with the name "John" and age 25.
person = new Person("John", 25)

# We call the "greet" function on the "person" object.
person.greet()

# Output:
# Hello there, my name is John!
