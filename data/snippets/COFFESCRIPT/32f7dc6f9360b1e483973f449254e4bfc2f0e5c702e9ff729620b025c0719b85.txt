### This code snippet creates a function that sorts an array of numbers in descending order
### without using any built-in functions

arr = [8, 4, 12, 6, 0, 17]

sortDesc = (arr) ->
  ### Loop through each number in the array ###
  for i in [0..arr.length-1]
    ### Loop through each number after the current element ###
    for j in [i+1..arr.length-1]
      ### If the current element is less than the next element, swap their positions ###
      if arr[i] < arr[j]
        temp = arr[i]
        arr[i] = arr[j]
        arr[j] = temp
  ### Return the sorted array ###
  arr
console.log(sortDesc(arr)) # => [17, 12, 8, 6, 4, 0]
