# Make a function that takes in an array and a callback, and returns a new array that includes
# the result of the callback on each element of the original array
map = (arr, callback) ->
  newArray = []
  for element in arr
    newElement = callback(element)
    newArray.push(newElement)
  return newArray

# Define a function that takes in a number and multiplies it by 5
multiplyBy5 = (num) ->
  num * 5

# Create an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use the map function to create a new array with each number multiplied by 5
newNumbers = map(numbers, multiplyBy5)

# Print the new array
console.log(newNumbers)

# Output:
# [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
