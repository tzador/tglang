# This code snippet creates a CoffeeScript class that inherits from a parent class
# and overrides the name and age properties.

###
class Animal extends LivingBeing
  # These are the parent class's properties that will be overridden
  name: "Unknown"
  age: 0

  # Constructor function for the class
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    # Calling the parent class's constructor function
    super(name, age)

  # Override the name property with a getter
  get name: ->
    # Use string interpolation to access the parent class's name property
    "My name is #{super}"

  # Override the age property with a setter
  set age: (newAge) ->
    # Use the throw keyword to prevent setting an age less than 0
    if newAge < 0
      throw new Error "Invalid age"
    else
      # Use the super keyword to set the age property of the parent class
      super newAge
