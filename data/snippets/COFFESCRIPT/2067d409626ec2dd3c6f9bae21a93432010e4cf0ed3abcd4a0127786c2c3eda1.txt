### Triple equals operator ###
### The triple equals operator, also known as the strict equality operator,
### compares two values based on their type and value. 
### It returns true if both values are the same, and false if they are not.
### Example:
age = 21
if(age === "21")		# triple equals to compare age variable with string "21"
	console.log "Equal!"	# prints "Equal!" since both values are of type number and have the value 21.
else
 	console.log "Not equal!"	# does not print "Not equal!" since both values are the same.
### Output: 
Equal! ###
