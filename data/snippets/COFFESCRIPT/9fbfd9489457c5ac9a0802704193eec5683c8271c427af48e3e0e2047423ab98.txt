# This is a function to calculate the average of an array of numbers
# The function takes in one argument, the array of numbers
#@param array
calculateAverage = (array) ->
  
  # Initialize a variable to store the sum of all the numbers in the array
  sum = 0
  
  # Loop through the array and add each number to the sum variable
  for number in array
    sum += number
  
  # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
  average = sum / array.length
  
  # Return the average
  return average

# Example usage of the function
array = [5, 7, 12, 3, 8]

# Call the function and store the result in a variable
result = calculateAverage(array)

# Print out the result
console.log result
