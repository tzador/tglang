# Function that calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
#
# Parameters:
#   n - the index of the number to calculate
# 
# Returns:
#   The nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
#
# Time Complexity: O(2^n)

fibonacci = (n) ->
  if n <= 1
    return n
  else
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Input - the index of the number to calculate
n = prompt('Enter the index of the number to calculate:')

# Calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
result = fibonacci(n)

# Output - print the result
console.log("The " + n + "th term of the Fibonacci sequence is: " + result)
