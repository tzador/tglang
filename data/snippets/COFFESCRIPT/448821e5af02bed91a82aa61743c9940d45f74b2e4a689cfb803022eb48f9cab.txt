# This code snippet is written in COFFESCRIPT and utilizes object-oriented programming concepts, including classes, constructors, and inheritance.

class Shape

  # The constructor takes in the x and y coordinates of the shape and sets them as properties of the shape object.
  constructor: (x, y) ->
    @x = x
    @y = y
  
  # The draw method draws the shape on the canvas at its current x and y coordinates.
  draw: ->
    console.log "Drawing shape at x: #{@x} y: #{@y}"
  
# The Circle class inherits from the Shape class.
class Circle extends Shape

  # The constructor takes in the x and y coordinates of the circle and its radius, and sets them as properties of the circle object.
  constructor: (x, y, radius) ->
    super x, y
    @radius = radius
  
  # The draw method overrides the Shape class's draw method to draw a circle instead.
  draw: ->
    console.log "Drawing circle at x: #{@x} y: #{@y} with radius: #{@radius}"
  
# Instantiate a new Circle object with an x coordinate of 100, a y coordinate of 200, and a radius of 50.
circle = new Circle(100, 200, 50)

# Call the draw method on the circle object, which will print "Drawing circle at x: 100 y: 200 with radius: 50" to the console.
circle.draw()
