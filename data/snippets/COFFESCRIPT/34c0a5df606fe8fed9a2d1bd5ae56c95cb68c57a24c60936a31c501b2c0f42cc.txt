# This code snippet is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Coffeescript.

# CoffeeScript is a programming language that compiles into JavaScript. It was designed with the intention of making JavaScript code more readable and maintainable. It has a syntax inspired by Ruby and Python.

# The code starts by declaring three variables, each representing the three options in the game.

choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]

# Next, we define a function called `game` which takes in two parameters, `playerChoice` and `computerChoice`.

game = (playerChoice, computerChoice) ->
    console.log("Player chose #{playerChoice}, computer chose #{computerChoice}")

# The function body starts with a `console.log` statement which will print the player's and computer's choices.

# Next, we use a `switch` statement to determine the outcome of the game based on the choices made by the player and computer.

switch
    when (playerChoice is "Rock" and computerChoice is "Scissors") or (playerChoice is "Paper" and computerChoice is "Rock") or (playerChoice is "Scissors" and computerChoice is "Paper")
        console.log("Player wins!")

    when (playerChoice is "Rock" and computerChoice is "Paper") or (playerChoice is "Paper" and computerChoice is "Scissors") or (playerChoice is "Scissors" and computerChoice is "Rock")
        console.log("Computer wins!")

    else
    	console.log("It's a tie!")

# Finally, we call the `game` function and pass in the player's choice as the first argument and a random choice from the `choices` array as the second argument.

game("Rock", choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length)])
