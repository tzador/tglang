# This is a CoffeeScript implementation of a function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

# Define the factorial function with a parameter "num"
factorial = (num) ->
  
  # Base case: If num is 0 or 1, factorial is 1
  if num is 0 or num is 1
    return 1
    
  # Recursive case: Multiply num by the factorial of num-1
  else
    return num * factorial(num-1)

# Call the factorial function with the input of 5
console.log(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
