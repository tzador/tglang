This code snippet uses a "for" loop in Coffeescript to create a loop that will iterate from 1 to 10, incrementing by 2 each time. Within the loop, the console.log function is used to print the value of 'i' to the console. This snippet demonstrates the use of Coffeescript's syntax, which is meant to be more concise and readable than traditional JavaScript.
