### Example of using Coffeescript classes ###
# Define a parent class in Coffeescript
class Shape
  constructor: (@color) ->
  describe: ->
    console.log("This shape has a color of #{@color}")
  
# Define a child class that inherits from the Shape class
class Square extends Shape
  constructor: (@color, @sideLength) ->
    super(@color)
  calculateArea: ->
    console.log("The area of this square is #{@sideLength * @sideLength}")

# Create instances of the classes and call methods on them
square = new Square("red", 5)
square.describe()
square.calculateArea()

# Output:
# This shape has a color of red
# The area of this square is 25
