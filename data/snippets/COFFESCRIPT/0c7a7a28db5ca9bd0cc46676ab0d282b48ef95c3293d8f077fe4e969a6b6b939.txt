# This code snippet contains a class definition with two properties and two methods

class Car
  # Define the properties of the car class
  @make: null # @ denotes a class property

  # Define the stop method, returns a message
  stop: () ->

# Create an instance of the Car class with "Toyota" as make and "Camry" as model

# Call the accelerate method and store the return value in a variable
