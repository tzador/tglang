# Define a function named 'calculate'
calculate = (num1, num2) ->
  # Set variable sum to the sum of num1 and num2
  sum = num1 + num2
  # Set variable product to the product of num1 and num2
  product = num1 * num2
  # Create a string using interpolation with the sum and product variables
  result = "The sum of #{num1} and #{num2} is #{sum}. The product is #{product}."
  # Return the string
  return result

# Call the 'calculate' function with the values 5 and 10 and print the result
console.log(calculate(5, 10))
