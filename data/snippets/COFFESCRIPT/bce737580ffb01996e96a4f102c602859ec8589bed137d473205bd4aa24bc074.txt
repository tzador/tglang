### This code snippet will calculate the average score from a given array of scores ###

# Define an array of scores
scores = [85, 92, 78, 83, 90, 87]

# Define a function to calculate the average score
calculate_average = (scores) ->
    # Initialize a variable for total score
    total_score = 0
    # Loop through the array of scores
    for score in scores
        # Add each score to the total score variable
        total_score += score
    # Calculate the average by dividing the total score by the number of scores
    average = total_score / scores.length
    # Print the average score
    console.log("The average score is #{average}")

# Call the calculate_average function with the scores array as an argument
calculate_average(scores)

# Output: The average score is 86.16666666666667
