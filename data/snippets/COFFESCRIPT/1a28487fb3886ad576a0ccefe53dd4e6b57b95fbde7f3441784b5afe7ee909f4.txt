## Function to calculate the factorial of a given number

factorial = (num) ->
	result = 1
	# Recursive function to calculate the factorial
	calculateFactorial = (n) ->
		if n == num then return n
		result *= n
		calculateFactorial(n + 1)
	calculateFactorial(1)
	return result

# Call the function and pass in the number whose factorial needs to be calculated
result = factorial(5)
console.log(result) # Output: 120
