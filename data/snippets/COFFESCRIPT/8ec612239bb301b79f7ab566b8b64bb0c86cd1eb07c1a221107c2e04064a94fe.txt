# Function to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial = (num) ->
  # Checks if number is 0 or 1, then returns 1
  if num is 0 or num is 1
    return 1
  # Otherwise, calculates the factorial
  else
    # Uses recursion to call the function within itself
    return num * factorial(num - 1)

# Takes in a number from the user
num = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number: "))

# Calculates and prints the factorial of the number
console.log("Factorial of " + num + " is " + factorial(num))

# Output: Factorial of 5 is 120 (if input is 5)
