###
The following code creates a function that takes in two parameters, a and b,
and multiplies them together. It then assigns the result to a new variable called c.
It then checks if c is equal to 10, if it is, it logs "c is equal to 10" to the console,
if not, it logs "c is not equal to 10".
###
multiply = (a, b) ->
  c = a * b
  if c == 10
    console.log "c is equal to 10"
  else
    console.log "c is not equal to 10"
