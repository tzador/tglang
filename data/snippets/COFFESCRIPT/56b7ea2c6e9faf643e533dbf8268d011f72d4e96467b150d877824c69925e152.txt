# A simple function that takes in two numbers as parameters and adds them together
add = (num1, num2) ->
  num1 + num2

# An array of numbers
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

# A for loop that calls the add function and adds each number in the array to a running total
total = 0
for number in numbers
  total = add(total, number)

# Print out the final total
console.log "The final sum is: #{total}"
