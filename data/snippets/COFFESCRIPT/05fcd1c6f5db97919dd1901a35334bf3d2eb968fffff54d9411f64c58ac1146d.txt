# This is a Coffeescript function that determines if a given number is prime

# === FUNCTION: isPrime ===

isPrime = (num) ->
  # Checks if number is less than or equal to 1
  if num <= 1
    return false
  # Checks if number is divisible by 2 or 3
  else if num <= 3
    return true
  # Checks if number is divisible by any number between 2 and its square root
  else
    for i in [2..Math.floor(Math.sqrt(num))]
      if num % i == 0
        return false
  return true

# === OUTPUT ===
# The code above defines the function "isPrime" which takes in a single parameter "num".
# The function checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if so, returns "false" as 1 is not a prime number.
# If the number is greater than 1, then it checks if it is divisible by 2 or 3, and if so, returns "true" as those numbers are prime.
# If the number is not divisible by 2 or 3, then it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and its square root.
# If the number is divisible by any of those numbers, then it returns "false" as it is not a prime.
# If the number is not divisible by any of those numbers, then it returns "true" as it is a prime number.
