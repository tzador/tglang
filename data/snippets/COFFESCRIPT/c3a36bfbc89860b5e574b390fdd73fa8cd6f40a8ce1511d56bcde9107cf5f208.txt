# A function that calculates the factorial of a given number
factorial = (num) ->
  # Base case
  if num <= 1
    return 1
  else
    # Recursive function call
    return num * factorial(num - 1)

# An array of numbers to find the factorial of
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Mapping the factorial function onto each element in the numbers array
factorials = numbers.map((num) ->
  # Calling the factorial function
  factorial(num)
)

# Printing out the results
console.log(factorials) # Output should be [1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
