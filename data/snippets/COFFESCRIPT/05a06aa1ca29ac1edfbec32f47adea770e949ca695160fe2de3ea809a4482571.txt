# Annotated COFFESCRIPT code snippet 
# for creating a fibonacci sequence

# Function to generate fibonacci sequence up to n terms
fibonacci = (n) ->
  # Initialize array with first two numbers
  fib_array = [1, 1]

  # Use a for loop to iterate through remaining terms
  for i in [2..n-1]
    # Get the next number in the sequence by adding the last two numbers
    next_num = fib_array[i-1] + fib_array[i-2]

    # Push the next number to the array
    fib_array.push(next_num)

  # Return the generated fibonacci sequence
  fib_array

# Example usage: finding the fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms
fibonacci(10) # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
