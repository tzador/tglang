COFFESCRIPT is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript.
It is designed to make JavaScript code more elegant and readable.
It shares many similarities with JavaScript, but also has its own unique syntax and features.

In this code snippet, we will create a class called "Person" with a constructor to initialize its properties.

###

class Person
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age

# We create an instance of the "Person" class called "john" and pass in the values for name and age.
john = new Person("John", 25)

console.log(john.name) # Outputs "John"
console.log(john.age) # Outputs 25
