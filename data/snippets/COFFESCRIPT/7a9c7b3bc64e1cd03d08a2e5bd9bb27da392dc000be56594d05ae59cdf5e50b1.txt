# A complex function that takes in two arrays, checks for common values and returns the combination of both arrays
# This function makes use of the `indexOf()` method and `forEach()` loop
# Input: two arrays
# Output: array

coffeescript = (arr1, arr2) ->
  combined_array = []
  arr1.forEach (element) ->
    if (arr2.indexOf(element) != -1)
      combined_array.push(element)
  combined_array

# Explanation:
# The first line declares the function "coffeescript" and sets it to take in two parameters, which will represent the two arrays we want to compare.
# The next line sets up an empty array "combined_array" which will hold the values that are common in both arrays.
# Using the `forEach()` method, we loop through every element in the first array and check if it exists in the second array using the `indexOf()` method. If the value is found, it returns the index of that element, and if it is not found, it returns -1.
# If the value is found, we push it into the "combined_array".
# Finally, we return the "combined_array" which will contain all the common values between the two input arrays.
