### Function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points ###
euclideanDistance = (point1, point2) ->
    # Calculating the difference between the x-coordinates of the two points
    xDiff = point1[0] - point2[0]
    # Calculating the difference between the y-coordinates of the two points
    yDiff = point1[1] - point2[1]
    # Calculating the square of the x difference
    xDiffSquared = xDiff * xDiff
    # Calculating the square of the y difference
    yDiffSquared = yDiff * yDiff
    # Calculating the sum of the squares of the differences
    sum = xDiffSquared + yDiffSquared
    # Calculating the square root of the sum to get the Euclidean distance
    Math.sqrt(sum)
