# Annotated example of a CoffeeScript function
# that calculates the nth Fibonacci number
# for positive integers
fibonacci = (n) ->
  # Initialize a list with the first two Fibonacci numbers
  # (0 and 1)
  numbers = [0, 1]

  # Loop through each number from 2 to n
  for i in [2...n+1]

    # Calculate the ith Fibonacci number by adding the
    # previous two numbers in the list
    numbers.push(numbers[i-1] + numbers[i-2])

  # Return the nth Fibonacci number
  numbers[n]
