# Setting up a class called "Person" with two attributes: name and age
class Person
  constructor: (@name, @age) ->

# Instantiate a new instance of the Person class
person = new Person("John", 25)

# Creating a function called "greet" inside the Person class
# This function will print a greeting with the person's name
Person::greet = ->
  console.log("Hello, I am #{@name}!")

# Using an if statement to check if the person's age is greater than 18
# If true, call the greet function for the person object
if person.age > 18
  person.greet()

# Output:
# Hello, I am John!
