# Define a function that takes in two numbers and returns their product
multiply = (num1, num2) ->
  return num1 * num2

# Declare a variable with the value of 5
num1 = 5

# Declare another variable with the value of 7
num2 = 7

# Call the multiply function and pass in the two variables as arguments, store the result in a variable
product = multiply(num1, num2)

# Print the product variable
console.log(`The product of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${product}`)
