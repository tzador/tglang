# The following code creates a Person class with an initialize function that takes in three parameters:
# name, age, and occupation.
class Person
  constructor: (name, age, occupation) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @occupation = occupation

# The Person class has a method called introduce, which returns a string that introduces the person
# with their name, age, and occupation.
  introduce: ->
    "Hi, my name is #{@name}, I am #{@age} years old, and I work as a #{@occupation}."

# The Person class also has a method called celebrateBirthday, which increments the person's age by one.
  celebrateBirthday: ->
    @age++

# To create a new instance of the Person class, we can use the new keyword and pass in the required parameters.
bob = new Person("Bob", 30, "Software Developer")

# We can then call the introduce and celebrateBirthday methods on the bob instance.
bob.introduce() # Output: "Hi, my name is Bob, I am 30 years old, and I work as a Software Developer."
bob.celebrateBirthday()
bob.introduce() # Output: "Hi, my name is Bob, I am 31 years old, and I work as a Software Developer."
