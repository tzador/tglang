# Define a variable with a nested function that returns the square of any given number
square = (num) ->
  return () ->
    return num * num

# Assign the result of calling the square function with an input of 5 to a new variable
squared_five = square(5)()

# Create an object with two functions that utilize a closure to access the squared_five variable
operations = 
  add: (x) ->
    return x + squared_five
  multiply: (y) ->
    return y * squared_five

# Assign the result of calling the add function with an input of 10 to a new variable
added_ten = operations.add(10)

# Assign the result of calling the multiply function with an input of 5 to a new variable
multiplied_five = operations.multiply(5)

# Print the values of the added_ten and multiplied_five variables
console.log(added_ten)
console.log(multiplied_five)
