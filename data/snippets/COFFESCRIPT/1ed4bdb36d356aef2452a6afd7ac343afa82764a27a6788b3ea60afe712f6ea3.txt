# Snippet example of a CoffeeScript function:
###
# A function that takes in a number and returns a list of its prime factors
prime_factors = (num) ->
  # Edge case for 1 and 0
  if num < 2
    return []

  # Initialize an empty array to store prime factors
  factors = []

  # Loop through numbers from 2 to num
  for i in [2..num]
    # Check if i is a factor of num
    if num % i is 0
      # Check if i is a prime number
      prime = true
      for j in [2...i]
        if i % j is 0
          prime = false
          break

      # If i is prime, add it to the factors list
      if prime
        factors.push(i)

  # Return the list of prime factors
  return factors

# Sample call to the function
console.log(prime_factors(60))
