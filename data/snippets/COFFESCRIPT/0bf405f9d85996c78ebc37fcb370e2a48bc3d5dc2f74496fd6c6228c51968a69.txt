### This is a complex COFFEECOFFEE code snippet ###
# Declare a function that takes in two parameters
func = (x, y) ->
    # Perform a basic arithmetic operation using the parameters
    sum = x + y
    # Create a loop that iterates through an array
    for i in [1..5]
        # Multiply the current element by the sum
        product = i * sum
        # Print the product to the console
        console.log product
# Call the function with two numbers
func(3,2)
# Output:
# 5
# 10
# 15
# 20
# 25
