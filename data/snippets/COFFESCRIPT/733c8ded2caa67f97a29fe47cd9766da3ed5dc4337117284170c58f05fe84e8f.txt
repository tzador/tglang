# The following function takes in an array of numbers and returns the average value 
# Parameters:
#   numbers (Array) - An array of numbers
# Returns:
#   (Float) - The average value of the numbers in the array
average = (numbers) ->
  total = 0 # initialize total variable to 0
  for num in numbers # loop through each number in the array
    total += num # add the number to the total
  result = total / numbers.length # calculate the average by dividing the total by the length of the array
  return result # return the average value as a float

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average(numbers) # this will return 3 as the average value
