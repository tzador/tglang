area = (length, width) =>
  length * width 

###Declaring variables for length and width
length = 10 
width = 5

###Calling the function and storing the result in a variable
rectangleArea = area(length, width)

###Logging the result to the console
console.log "The surface area of the rectangle is: #{rectangleArea}"
