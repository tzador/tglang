# This function prints a Fibonacci series up to a given number
# Input: num - the number up to which the series should be printed
# Output: Prints the Fibonacci series up to the given number

printSeries = (num) ->
  a = 0
  b = 1
  for i in [1..num]
    console.log(a)
    temp = a + b
    a = b
    b = temp
    # Output: Prints the next number in the Fibonacci series
    console.log(a)

# Output: Prints the Fibonacci series up to the number 10
printSeries(10)

# Output: Prints the Fibonacci series up to the number 20
printSeries(20)
