## This code snippet demonstrates creating an object using Coffescript

## First, we declare a class called "Person" and assign it to a variable.
class Person

# We then set the constructor for the class, which will assign values to our object's properties.
constructor: (name, age, country) ->
this.name = name
this.age = age
this.country = country

# Next, we define a method called "introduce" that will print out a message with the object's properties.
introduce: ->
console.log("Hello! My name is #{this.name}, I am #{this.age} years old, and I am from #{this.country}.")

# Finally, we create a new instance of our "Person" class and pass in arguments for its properties.
newPerson = new Person("John", 28, "USA")

# We can now call the "introduce" method on our new object and see the output in the console.
newPerson.introduce()

# Output: Hello! My name is John, I am 28 years old, and I am from USA.
