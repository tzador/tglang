# Creating a CoffeeScript class
class Animal
  # Constructor method
  constructor: (@name, @type) ->
    # Setting default values
    @age = 0
    @height = 0

    # Defining an instance method
    @eat: (food) ->
      console.log "#{@name} is eating #{food}"

    # Defining a class method

      console.log "#{@type} is a type of animal"

# Creating an instance of the Animal class

# Calling the showType method on the Animal class
