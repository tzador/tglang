# This is a CoffeeScript function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number
# It uses an iterative approach with dynamic programming for efficiency

fibonacci = (n) ->
  # Initialize an array to store calculated values
  # We start with the first two numbers in the sequence
  fib_arr = [0, 1]

  # Loop through the remaining numbers
  for i in [2..n]
    # Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
    next_fib = fib_arr[i-1] + fib_arr[i-2]
    # Append the new number to the array
    fib_arr.push(next_fib)
 
  # Return the nth Fibonacci number
  return fib_arr[n]

# Call the function and print the result
