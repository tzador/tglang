### This code snippet uses Coffeescript to create and print a fibonacci sequence up to a certain number ###
# Generate a fibonacci sequence function
fibonacci = (num) ->
  a = 0 # starting number
  b = 1 # second number
  result = [a, b] # list to store the sequence
  while b < num # loop until number is reached
    c = a + b # add previous two numbers
    result.push(c) # append result to list
    a = b # update variables for next iteration
    b = c
  return result

# Print the fibonacci sequence up to 50
console.log("The fibonacci sequence up to 50 is: " + fibonacci(50))
