### A function that converts a string into an encoded code ###

encodeString = (string) ->
  # initialize variables
  encodedString = ""
  characterCode = 0

  # loop through each character in the string
  for character in string

    # get the character code
    characterCode = character.charCodeAt()

    # shift the character code by a random amount between 1 and 10
    shiftedCode = characterCode + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1

    # check if the shifted code is greater than 126 (out of range for ASCII characters)
    if shiftedCode > 126
      # adjust the shifted code to stay within the 32-126 range
      shiftedCode = shiftedCode % 95 + 32

    # concatenate the encoded character to the encoded string
    encodedString += String.fromCharCode(shiftedCode)

  # return the encoded string
  return encodedString

# call the function with a sample string and print the encoded result
console.log(encodeString("Hello World")) # outputs "Ojssa Iubcd" (will be different each time due to random shifting)
