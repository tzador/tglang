### This code snippet uses recursion to find the largest element in an array ###

largest = (arr) ->
  # base case: returns empty array as largest element
  return [] if arr.length is 0
  # recursive case: checks if first element is larger than largest element in rest of array
  largest_rest = largest(arr.slice(1))
  if arr[0] > largest_rest
    # sets first element as largest if it is larger than largest_rest
    return arr[0]
  else
    # otherwise, largest_rest is the largest element
    return largest_rest

# example array
arr = [5, 10, 3, 7, 2, 8, 4]

# prints the largest element in the array
console.log largest(arr)

# Output: 10
