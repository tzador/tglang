This is a complex code snippet in Coffeescript. 
It defines a class called "Person" with a constructor, getters and setters for name and age, and a method to introduce the person.
It also has a static variable that keeps track of the total number of instances of the Person class.
### 
class Person
  constructor: (@name, @age) ->
    @_intro = "Hi, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
    Person.numInstances++
  
  get name: -> @name
  
  set name: (newName) -> 
    @name = newName
    
  get age: -> @age
  
  set age: (newAge) -> 
    @age = newAge
    
  introduce: -> console.log @_intro
  
  static numInstances = 0
