### This code snippet generates a Fibonacci sequence of specified length. ###

# Define a function called fibonacci with a parameter of `length`
# with a default value of `10`. This function will return an array
# containing the Fibonacci sequence.
fibonacci = (length = 10) ->
  # Create an empty array to store the sequence.
  sequence = []
  # Set the first two numbers of the sequence.
  sequence[0] = 0
  sequence[1] = 1
  # Use a loop to generate the rest of the sequence.
  for i in [2...length]
    # Add the two previous numbers in the sequence to get the new number.
    sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2]
  # Return the sequence array.
  sequence

# Call the fibonacci function with a length of 15 and store the result
# in a variable named `fib_sequence`.
fib_sequence = fibonacci(15)
# Print the resulting array to the console.
console.log(fib_sequence)

# Output:
[ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377 ]
