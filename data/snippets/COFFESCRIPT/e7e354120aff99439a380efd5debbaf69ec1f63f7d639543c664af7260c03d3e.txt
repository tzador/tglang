### This snippet generates an array of numbers, squares each number, and finds the sum of the squared numbers ###

# Define a function to generate an array of numbers
squareNumbers = ->
  numbers = []
  for i in [1..10] # Generates an array of numbers from 1 to 10
    numbers.push(i)
  return numbers

# Define a function to square each number in the array
squareNumbersArray = (numbers) ->
  squaredNumbers = []
  for number in numbers
    squaredNumbers.push(number * number)
  return squaredNumbers

# Define a function to find the sum of the squared numbers
findSum = (squaredNumbers) ->
  sum = 0
  for number in squaredNumbers
    sum += number
  return sum

# Call the functions and store the result
squaredNumbers = squareNumbers()
squaredNumbersArray = squareNumbersArray(squaredNumbers)
sum = findSum(squaredNumbersArray)

# Print the result
console.log("The sum of the squared numbers is: " + sum)
