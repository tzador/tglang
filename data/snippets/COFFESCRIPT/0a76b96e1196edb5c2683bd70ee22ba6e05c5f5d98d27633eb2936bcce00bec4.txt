## Define a function called 'multiplier' that takes in two parameters, 'a' and 'b'
multiplier = (a, b) ->
    # Declare a variable 'product' and assign it a value of 0
    product = 0

    # Use a for loop to iterate through 'a' number of times
    for i in [1..a]
        # Use a Coffeescript conditional statement to check if 'b' is less than 10
        if b < 10
            # Add 'b' to 'product' and reassign the value to 'product'
            product += b
        # Else, use another Coffeescript conditional statement to check if 'b' is equal to 10
        else if b == 10
            # Double 'product' and reassign the value to 'product'
            product *= 2
        # Else, use a Coffeescript conditional statement to check if 'b' is greater than 10
        else if b > 10
            # Use Coffeescript ternary operator to check if 'b' is even or odd
            # If 'b' is even, subtract 5 from 'product' and reassign the value to 'product'
            # If 'b' is odd, add 5 to 'product' and reassign the value to 'product'
            product = b % 2 == 0 ? (product - 5) : (product + 5)
    
    # Use a Coffeescript conditional statement to check if 'product' is less than 100
    if product < 100
        # Call the 'multiplier' function recursively, passing in 'product' and 'b' as parameters
        multiplier(product, b)
    # Else if 'product' is greater than 100, use Coffeescript string interpolation to print the result
    else if product > 100
        console.log "The result is #{product}"

## Call the 'multiplier' function with 'a' as 5 and 'b' as 12
multiplier(5, 12)
