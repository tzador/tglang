### This code snippet creates a class "Person" and defines three methods within the class: 
getName - which returns the person's name
setAge - which sets the person's age
getAge - which returns the person's age 

### Define the "Person" class
class Person

  ### Constructor function for setting the name and age of a person
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age

  ### Method to get the person's name
  getName: ->
    return @name
  
  ### Method to set the person's age, with validation to make sure it's a number
  setAge: (age) ->
    if typeof age is "number"
      @age = age
    else
      console.log("Age must be a number!")

  ### Method to get the person's age
  getAge: ->
    return @age

### Create a new instance of the Person class
person1 = new Person("John", 30)

### Call the getName method on person1 to return the name
person1.getName()

### Call the setAge method on person1 to set the age to 35
person1.setAge(35)

### Call the getAge method on person1 to return the updated age
person1.getAge()
