# This code snippet creates a Fibonacci sequence of n numbers
# where n is a parameter passed into the function
# Function to generate Fibonacci sequence
fib = (n) ->
  # Initializing variables for first and second numbers in sequence
  first = 0
  second = 1
  # Loop to generate sequence
  for i in [2..n]
    # Calculating next number in sequence and adding it to result array
    result[i] = first + second
    # Reassigning first and second variables
    first = second
    second = result[i]
  # Returning resulting array
  return result
# Calling function with n = 10 as an example
console.log(fib(10))
