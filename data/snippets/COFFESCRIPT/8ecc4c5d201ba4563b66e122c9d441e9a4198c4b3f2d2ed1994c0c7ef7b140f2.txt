### This code uses Coffeescript to create and print a 3x3 grid ###
# Creating a 3x3 grid object
grid =
  rows: 3
  cols: 3
  cells: []

# Populating the grid cells with numbers
for row in [0..grid.rows - 1]
  for col in [0..grid.cols - 1]
    # Randomly generate and add a number from 1 to 9 to each cell
    grid.cells.push Math.ceil(Math.random() * 9)

# Function to print the grid
printGrid = (grid) ->
  # Loop through each row in the grid
  for i in [0..grid.rows - 1]
    # Create a string to hold the numbers in each row
    row = ''
    # Loop through each column in the row
    for j in [0..grid.cols - 1]
      # Add the number at the current cell to the row string
      row += grid.cells[i * grid.rows + j] + ' '
    # Print the row string
    console.log(row)

# Calling the printGrid function with the grid object
printGrid(grid)
