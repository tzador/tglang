# This code uses conditional statements and loops to generate a list of prime numbers between 2 and 100
# Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and itself

# Define a function to determine if a number is prime
is_prime = (num) ->
    # Skip 0 and 1
    if num < 2
        return false

    # Check if num is divisible by any number between 2 and num-1
    # If it is divisible, then it is not prime
    for i in [2...num]
        if num % i is 0
            return false

    # If num is not divisible by any number between 2 and num-1, then it is prime
    return true

# Define an empty list to store the prime numbers
prime_numbers = []

# Loop through the numbers between 2 and 100
for num in [2...101]
    # Check if num is prime
    if is_prime(num)
        # If it is prime, add it to the list
        prime_numbers.push num

# Print the list of prime numbers
console.log prime_numbers
