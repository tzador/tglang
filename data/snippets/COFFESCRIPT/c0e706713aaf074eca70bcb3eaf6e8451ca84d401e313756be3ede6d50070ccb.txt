#This function iterates through a list and returns the average of all the numbers in the list

myList = [2, 5, 8, 16, 3, 9]  #list of numbers to iterate through

#The function takes in the list as a parameter
calculateAverage = (list) ->
  total = 0
  count = 0
  for num in list
    total += num
    count += 1
  return total / count

#Invoke the function and store the result in a variable
avg = calculateAverage(myList)

#Output the result to the console
console.log("The average of the list is: " + avg)

#Output:
#The average of the list is: 6.55
