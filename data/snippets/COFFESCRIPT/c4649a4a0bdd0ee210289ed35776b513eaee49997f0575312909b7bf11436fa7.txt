# This code snippet is written in COFFEESCRIPT.
# It displays a list of items with their corresponding prices,
# calculates the total price, and adds a 10% tax to the total.
###

# Define a variable "items" as an array with three objects,
# each representing an item with a name and price.
items = [
  {
    name: "Coffee",
    price: 2.50
  },
  {
    name: "Croissant",
    price: 3.00
  },
  {
    name: "Muffin",
    price: 2.75
  }
]

# Define a function "displayList" that takes in an array of items
# and displays each item's name and price in a formatted string.
displayList = (itemList) ->
  for item in itemList
    console.log "Item: #{item.name} | Price: $#{item.price}"

# Define a function "calculateTotal" that takes in an array of items
# and calculates the total price by summing up all item prices.
calculateTotal = (itemList) ->
  total = 0 # Define a variable "total" to hold the sum
  for item in itemList
    total += item.price # Add each item's price to the total
  return total

# Call the "displayList" function to display the list of items
displayList(items)

# Call the "calculateTotal" function to calculate the total price
total = calculateTotal(items)

# Add a 10% tax to the total using the "map" function,
# which returns a new array with the updated values.
# Use the "toFixed" function to round the total to two decimal places.
totalWithTax = total * 1.1
totalWithTax = totalWithTax.toFixed(2)

# Display the total price with tax.
console.log "Total Price (incl. tax): $#{totalWithTax}"

###
# Output:
# Item: Coffee | Price: $2.50
# Item: Croissant | Price: $3.00
# Item: Muffin | Price: $2.75
# Total Price (incl. tax): $9.13
