# Define a function that takes in a list and returns a new list with only even numbers

myFunction = (list) ->
  new_list = [] # Initialize empty list
  for num in list  # Loop through each number in input list
    if num % 2 == 0  # Check if number is even 
      new_list.push(num)  # If even, add to new list
  return new_list  # Return new list with only even numbers

# Call function and print result
console.log(myFunction([1,2,3,4,5,6]))  # Output: [2,4,6]
