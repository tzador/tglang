# This is a function that takes in an array and returns the total sum of its elements.
sumArray = (arr) ->
  sum = 0
  for num in arr
    sum += num

# This function takes in a string and checks if it is a palindrome.

# This function takes in an input and manipulates it based on certain conditions.
manipulateInput = (input) ->
  if input % 2 == 0
    input = input * 2
  else if input % 3 == 0
    input = input * 3
  return input
  
# This is a sample array that will be used as an input.
myArray = [5, 10, 15]

# This loop iterates through the array and calls the manipulateInput function for each element.
for num in myArray
  console.log(manipulateInput(num))

# Output: 10, 20, 45 (since 5 will be multiplied by 2, 10 will remain the same, and 15 will be multiplied by 3)

# This variable stores a random string input.
myString = "racecar"

# This condition checks if the input string is a palindrome and prints a message accordingly.

# Output: The string "racecar" is a palindrome.
