class Animal
  constructor: (name, age, species) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @species = species

  speak: ->
    console.log("Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old.")

# Create instances of the Animal class
dog = new Animal("Max", 5, "dog")
cat = new Animal("Fluffy", 3, "cat")

# Call the speak method on the instances
dog.speak()
