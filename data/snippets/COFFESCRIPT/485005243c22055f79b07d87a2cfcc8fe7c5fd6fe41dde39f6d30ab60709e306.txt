# A simple Coffeescript function that takes in two parameters
# and returns the sum of the two numbers.

sum = (num1, num2) ->
  result = num1 + num2
  return result

# A conditional statement that checks if the result of the sum is greater than 10.
# If it is, it prints out a message. Otherwise, it prints out a different message.

if result > 10  # if the result is greater than 10
  console.log "The sum is greater than 10."  # print this message
else  # if the result is not greater than 10
  console.log "The sum is less than or equal to 10."  # print this message

# A for loop that iterates 10 times and prints out the current index value.
# The index value is incremented by 1 each time.

for i in [0...10]  # loop from 0 to 9
  console.log "The current index value is #{i + 1}."  # print out the current index value

# An object with two properties, "name" and "age".

person =
  name: "John"
  age: 25

# A function that takes in an object and prints out the values of its properties.

printValues = (obj) ->
  console.log "Name: #{obj.name}"
  console.log "Age: #{obj.age}"
  
# Call the function and pass in the "person" object as an argument.

printValues(person)

# Output:
# The sum is greater than 10.
# The current index value is 1.
# The current index value is 2.
# The current index value is 3.
# The current index value is 4.
# The current index value is 5.
# The current index value is 6.
# The current index value is 7.
# The current index value is 8.
# The current index value is 9.
# The current index value is 10.
