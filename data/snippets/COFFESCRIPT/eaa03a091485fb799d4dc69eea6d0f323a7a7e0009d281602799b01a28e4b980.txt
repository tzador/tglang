# This is a function that takes in two numbers as parameters and returns their sum
calculateSum = (num1, num2) ->
    # The `sum` variable stores the sum of the two numbers
    sum = num1 + num2
    # `sum` is then multiplied by 2 and reassigned to `sum`
    sum = sum * 2
    # The `sum` is then divided by 3 and returned as the final sum
    return sum / 3

# Example usage of the function, with numbers 5 and 10 passed in as arguments
result = calculateSum(5, 10)

# Output:
# `result` now stores the value of 10, since (5 + 10) * 2 / 3 equals 10
