# Assign a variable with a numerical value
num = 5

# Create a function that accepts two arguments
myFunction = (arg1, arg2) ->
    # Add the two arguments and assign them to a variable
    sum = arg1 + arg2

    # Check if the sum is greater than or equal to 10
    if sum >= 10 then
        # If true, log the sum to the console
        console.log sum
    else
        # If false, log an error message to the console
        console.log "The sum is less than 10. Please try again."

# Call the function with two numbers as arguments
myFunction(2, 8) # Output: 10
myFunction(3, 5) # Output: "The sum is less than 10. Please try again."
