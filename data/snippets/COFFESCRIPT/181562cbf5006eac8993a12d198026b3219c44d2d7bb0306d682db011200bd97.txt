###
This is a CoffeeScript snippet that uses a recursive function to search for a specific value in a list.
The function takes in two parameters: the list and the value to search for. It returns true if the value is found, and false if it is not.
###

search = (list, value) ->
  if list.length is 0 # base case
    return false
  if list[0] is value # return true if value is found
    return true
  else
    search(list[1..], value) # recurse through the rest of the list

list = [7, 2, 8, 5, 3, 1]
value = 5

if search(list, value)
  console.log("The value #{value} was found in the list #{list}.")
else
  console.log("The value #{value} was not found in the list #{list}.")
