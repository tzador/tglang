### Defining a function called "calculateSum" that takes in two parameters ###
### including an array of numbers and a callback function ###

calculateSum = (array, callback) ->
  total = 0 # Initializing a variable to store the total sum
  
  # Looping through the array and adding each element to the total #
  for num in array
    total += num
  
  # Passing the total and array as arguments to the callback function #
  # This allows us to perform additional operations on the sum #
  callback(total, array)
  
### Invoking the "calculateSum" function ###
calculateSum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (sum, arr) ->
  console.log("The sum of the array " + arr + " is " + sum)
)
