# This code snippet uses a function to check if a number is prime or not

(num) ->              # Defines a function that takes in a number as an argument
   prime = true       # Initializes a variable prime to be true, assuming the number is prime
   if num <= 1        # Checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, which is not prime
      prime = false   # Sets prime to false
   else
      for i in [2..num-1]   # Loops from 2 to num - 1, the possible factors of the number
         if num % i == 0    # Checks if the number is divisible by the current factor
            prime = false   # Sets prime to false if it is divisible
            break           # Breaks out of the loop
   if prime           # Checks if the number is still prime
      console.log(num + " is a prime number")    # Prints a message to the console
   else
      console.log(num + " is not a prime number")    # Prints a message to the console
