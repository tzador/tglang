# Create a function called fibonacci
fibonacci = (n) ->
  # Initialize an empty array to store fibonacci sequence
  sequence = []
  # Loop through until the nth term is reached
  for i in [0...n]
    # If the current index is 0 or 1, add it to the sequence
    if i is 0 or i is 1
      sequence.push(i)
    # If not, add the sum of the previous two terms to the sequence
    else
      sequence.push(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])
  # Return the fibonacci sequence
  return sequence

# Call the function with input n = 10 and assign the output to a variable
fib = fibonacci(10)
# Print the fibonacci sequence
console.log("Fibonacci Sequence: ", fib)
