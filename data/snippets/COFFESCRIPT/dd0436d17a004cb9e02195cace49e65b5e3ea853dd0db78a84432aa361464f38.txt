# This code snippet creates an inventory list and calculates the total cost of all items

# Create an object for the inventory list
inventory = 
  'apples':
    price: 1.50
    quantity: 10
  'bananas':
    price: 0.75
    quantity: 20
  'oranges':
    price: 1.00
    quantity: 15

# Function to calculate total cost of all items
calculateTotalCost = (inventory) ->
  # Initialize total cost variable
  totalCost = 0

  # Loop through the inventory list
  for item, details of inventory
    # Add the price of each item multiplied by its quantity to the total cost
    totalCost += details.price * details.quantity

  # Return the total cost
  totalCost

# Call the calculateTotalCost function and assign the result to a variable
totalCost = calculateTotalCost(inventory)

# Output the total cost 
console.log "The total cost of all items is $#{totalCost}."
