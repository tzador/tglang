# This is a Coffeescript program using a for loop and conditional statements
# The program calculates the factorial of a given number

# Define a variable for the user input
number = prompt "Enter a number:"

# Initialize a variable to hold the factorial value
factorial = 1

# Loop through each number from 1 to the input number using a for loop
for i in [1..number]
  # Check if the current value of the factorial is zero (initial condition)
  if factorial == 0
    # If it is, set it to 1
    factorial = 1

  # Multiply the current factorial value by the current loop index value
  factorial = factorial * i
  
  # Print the current factorial value
  console.log "Current factorial value: #{factorial}"

# Print the final result
console.log "The factorial of #{number} is #{factorial}"
