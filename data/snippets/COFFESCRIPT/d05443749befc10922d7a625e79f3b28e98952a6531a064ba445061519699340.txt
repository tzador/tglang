# A function that takes in two numbers and returns their greatest common divisor

# Function name: `gcd`
# Parameters: `num1`, `num2`

gcd = (num1, num2) ->
    # Determine which number is smaller
    if num1 < num2 then
        smaller = num1
    else
        smaller = num2

    # Loop through all possible divisors starting from the smaller number
    for i in [smaller..1] by -1
        # Check if `i` is a divisor of both `num1` and `num2`
        if num1 % i == 0 and num2 % i == 0
            # Return the greatest common divisor
            return i

# Output: the greatest common divisor of `24` and `36`
gcd(24, 36)
