# This code snippet is a simple example of how to create a class in Coffeescript with
# constructor and methods, as well as private variables and methods

# Define the class
class Person
  # Private variable
  _name = ""

  # Constructor to initialize the name property
  constructor: (@name) ->

  # Method to set the name
  setName: (newName) ->
    _name = newName

  # Method to get the name
  getName: ->
    _name

  # Private method
  _privateMethod: ->
    console.log("This is a private method")

# Create an instance of the Person class
person1 = new Person("John")

# Set a new name using the setName method
person1.setName("Jack")

# Get the name using the getName method
console.log(person1.getName())

# This should output "Jack" since the name was changed using the setName method
