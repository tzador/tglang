# This is an example of a complex CoffeeScript function
# that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum
# of all the even numbers in the array.

# Define the function with one parameter, an array of numbers.
sumEven = (arr) ->
  # Set the initial sum to 0
  sum = 0
  # Loop through each element in the array
  for num in arr
    # Check if the current number is even
    if num % 2 == 0
      # If it is, add it to the sum
      sum += num

  # Return the final sum
  return sum

# Example input array
inputArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Call the function and store the returned sum in a variable
result = sumEven(inputArr)

# Print the result to the console
console.log("The sum of all even numbers in the array is:", result)
