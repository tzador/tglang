# This function takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array
getEvenSum = (array) ->
  evenSum = 0 # initialize a variable to store the sum of even numbers
  for num in array # loop through the array
    if num % 2 == 0 # check if the number is even
      evenSum += num # add it to the evenSum variable
  return evenSum # return the final sum

# Example input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Output should be 12 since 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
console.log(getEvenSum(numbers)) # print the result to the console
