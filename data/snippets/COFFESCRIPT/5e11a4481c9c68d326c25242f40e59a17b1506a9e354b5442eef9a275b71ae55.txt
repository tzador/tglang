### This code snippet uses Coffeescript to create a function that calculates the factorial of a given number ###
factorial = (num) ->                   # Creates a function called "factorial" that takes in a parameter "num"
  total = 1                            # Creates a variable "total" and sets it to 1
  for i in [1..num]                    # Starts a for loop that iterates through numbers from 1 to "num"
    total *= i                         # Multiplies "total" by the current number in the loop
  total                                # Returns the final value of "total"

console.log(factorial(5))              # Prints the factorial of 5 to the console, should output 120
