###
Function to find the lowest common multiple between two numbers
Takes in two numbers as parameters, num1 and num2
Returns the updated value of num1 after it has been divided by the lowest common multiple
###

lcm = (num1, num2) ->
  # finding the greatest common divisor using Euclidean algorithm
  gcd = (a, b) ->
    while b
      a = b
      b = a % b
    a
  # finding the lowest common multiple by multiplying the two numbers 
  lcm = (num1 * num2) / gcd(num1, num2)
  # dividing num1 by the lcm and updating its value
  num1 = num1 / lcm
lcm(12, 16) # returns 3 as the updated value of num1 after being divided by the lcm
