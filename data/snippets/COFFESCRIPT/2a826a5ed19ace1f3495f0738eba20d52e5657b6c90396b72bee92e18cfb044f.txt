# This is a CoffeeScript implementation of the classic "FizzBuzz" problem

# Define a function that takes in a number as its argument
fizzbuzz = (num) ->
    # Create a condition to check if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
    if num % 3 is 0 and num % 5 is 0
        console.log "FizzBuzz"
    # If the number is only divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
    else if num % 3 is 0
        console.log "Fizz"
    # If the number is only divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
    else if num % 5 is 0
        console.log "Buzz"
    # If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, simply print the number
    else
        console.log num

# Create a loop that iterates from 1 to 100
for num in [1..100]
    # Call the fizzbuzz function on each number in the loop
    fizzbuzz(num)
