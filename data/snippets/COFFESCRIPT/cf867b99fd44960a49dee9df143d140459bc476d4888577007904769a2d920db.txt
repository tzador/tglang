# This function takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the array
fun sumEvenNumbers(numbers):
  # We initialize the sum variable to 0
  sum = 0

  # We use a for loop to iterate through the array
  for num in numbers:
    # We check if the current number is even
    if num % 2 == 0:
      # If it is, we add it to the sum
      sum += num
  # Once the loop is completed, we return the sum of even numbers
  return sum

# Here we define an array of numbers with both even and odd values
numbers = [3, 8, 15, 6, 11, 4, 2]

# We call the sumEvenNumbers function and pass in the array as an argument
sum = sumEvenNumbers(numbers)

# We print the sum of even numbers
console.log("The sum of even numbers is " + sum)
