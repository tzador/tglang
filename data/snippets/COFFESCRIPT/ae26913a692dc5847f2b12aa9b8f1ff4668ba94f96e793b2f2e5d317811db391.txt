# Define a function called `calculateAverage`
calculateAverage = (array) ->
  # Set initial total to 0
  total = 0
  # Loop through each element in the array and add it to the total
  for element in array
    total += element
  # Calculate the average by dividing the total by the length of the array
  average = total / array.length
  # Return the calculated average
  average

# Define an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Call the `calculateAverage` function passing in the `numbers` array as the argument
result = calculateAverage(numbers)
# Print the result to the console
console.log(result)
