### This code snippet is a function that takes in an array and returns the sum of all elements multiplied by 2 ###

sumByTwo = (arr) ->
    total = 0 # Variable to hold the sum of all elements
    for i in arr # Loop through each element in the array
        total += i * 2 # Multiply the element by 2 and add it to the total
    console.log "The sum of all elements multiplied by 2 is:", total # Print the total
    return total # Return the total

# Example Call:
sumByTwo([1,2,3,4,5]) # Output: The sum of all elements multiplied by 2 is: 30

# This function can be modified to take in any numerical array and return the sum of all elements multiplied by a given number, not just 2.
