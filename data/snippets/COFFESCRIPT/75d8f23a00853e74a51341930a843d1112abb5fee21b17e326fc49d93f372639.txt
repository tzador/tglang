# This code snippet uses Coffeescript, a programming language that transpiles into JavaScript.
# It creates a function that generates a random Fibonacci sequence based on a given length.

# Define the generateSequence function that takes in a single parameter length.
generateSequence = (length) ->

  # Check if length is a number and throw an error if it isn't.
  if typeof length != "number"
    throw new Error("The input must be a number.")

  # If length is 0 or 1, return an empty array or an array containing only 0 respectively.
  if length == 0
    return []
  else if length == 1
    return [0]

  # Define an empty array to store the sequence.
  sequence = []

  # Create a loop that runs until the length of the sequence matches the given length.
  until sequence.length == length
    # If the sequence has a length of 0 or 1, push 0 or 1 respectively.
    if sequence.length == 0
      sequence.push(0)
    else if sequence.length == 1
      sequence.push(1)
    else
      # Otherwise, push the sum of the last two elements in the sequence.
      sequence.push(sequence[sequence.length - 2] + sequence[sequence.length - 1])
  
  # Return the final sequence.
  return sequence

# Call the generateSequence function with a length of 10.
