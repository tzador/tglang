###Create a function named 'calculateCupCost' which takes in two parameters, 
###'numberOfCups' and 'cupPrice', and calculates the total cost of the cups

calculateCupCost = (numberOfCups, cupPrice) ->
  totalCost = numberOfCups * cupPrice #calculate total cost by multiplying number of cups by price per cup
  console.log "The total cost of #{numberOfCups} cups is #{totalCost} dollars." #print total cost to console
  return totalCost #return total cost

###Call the function with 10 cups and a price of $2 per cup
calculateCupCost(10, 2) #should output "The total cost of 10 cups is 20 dollars." 

###Call the function with 5 cups and a price of $3 per cup
calculateCupCost(5, 3) #should output "The total cost of 5 cups is 15 dollars."
