coffeeShop = "Starbucks"
menuItems =["Latte", "Mocha", "Cappuccino", "Americano"]
prices = { Latte: 3.50, Mocha: 4.25, Cappuccino: 3.75, Americano: 2.75 }

## Define functions

order = (drink) ->
  if menuItems.includes(drink)
    console.log("Enjoy your #{drink} from #{coffeeShop}! That will be $#{prices[drink]}")
  else
    console.log("Sorry, we do not serve #{drink} at #{coffeeShop}.")

addNewMenuItem = (drink, price) ->
  if drink in Object.keys(prices)
    console.log("There is already a #{drink} on the menu at #{coffeeShop}. Please enter a different drink.")
  else
    menuItems.push(drink)
    prices[drink] = price
    console.log("#{drink} has been added to the menu at #{coffeeShop} for $#{price}")
