# A function in CoffeeScript that finds the factorial of a given number

factorial = (num) ->
  # Check if number is 0 or 1, return 1 if true
  if num is 0 or num is 1 then return 1
  # Otherwise, initialize result variable to 1
  result = 1
  # Use a for loop to calculate factorial
  for i in [2..num]
    # Multiply result by current number
    result *= i
  # Return the calculated factorial
  return result

# Call the function with input of 5 and print the output
console.log factorial(5)
