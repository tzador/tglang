# This is a complex function that takes in two arrays and returns the sum of the lengths of the longest string in each array.

# Initialize variables
longest1 = 0
longest2 = 0

# Function definition
findLongestString = (arr1, arr2) ->
    # Loop through first array
    for item in arr1
        # Check if current item is longer than current longest string
        if item.length > longest1
            # Update current longest string length
            longest1 = item.length
    
    # Loop through second array
    for item in arr2
        # Check if current item is longer than current longest string
        if item.length > longest2
            # Update current longest string length
            longest2 = item.length
    
    # Return the sum of the two longest string lengths
    return longest1 + longest2

# Example function call
longest = findLongestString(["apple", "banana", "orange"], ["pineapple", "blueberry", "strawberry"])
# Output: 19
