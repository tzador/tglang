# This is a complex COFFESCRIPT code snippet that contains various syntax and operations.
# It is a function that takes in an array and returns the average of its elements.
# It also uses arrow functions and template literals to concatenate strings and numbers.
# Lastly, it uses the spread operator to manipulate the array.

findAverage = (arr) ->
    sum = 0 # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    for i in arr # Loop through the elements in the array
        sum += i # Add each element to the sum
    avg = sum / arr.length # Calculate the average
    console.log(`The average of ${arr} is ${avg}`) # Use template literals to print out the array and average
    
    # Use arrow function and spread operator to create a new array with the original array elements multiplied by 2
    newArr = arr.map((num) -> num * 2)
    console.log(`New array with elements doubled: ${newArr}`)
    
    return avg # Return the average
    
# Call the function with an example array
findAverage([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

# Output:
# The average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is 4
# New array with elements doubled: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
