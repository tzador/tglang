#A function that calculates the average of two numbers in CoffeeScript
average = (num1, num2) ->
  sum = num1 + num2 #Calculates the sum of the two numbers
  avg = sum / 2 #Divides the sum by 2 to get the average
  return avg #Returns the average value
#Sample function call:
console.log(average(5, 10)) #Outputs: 7.5 (the average of 5 and 10)
