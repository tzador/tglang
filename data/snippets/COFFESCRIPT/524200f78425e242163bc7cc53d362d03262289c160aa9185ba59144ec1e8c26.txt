### This is a complex code snippet in COFFESCRIPT that utilizes conditional statements, loops, and object manipulation ###

# Define an object with properties and methods
coffeeMachine = 
  brand: "Nespresso"
  color: "black"
  price: "$299.99"
  hasMilkFrother: true

# Check if the coffee machine has a milk frother using a conditional statement
if coffeeMachine.hasMilkFrother 
  # Use a for loop to iterate through the coffee flavors
  for flavor in ["espresso", "latte", "cappuccino"]

    # Use string interpolation to output the brand and flavor in a sentence
    console.log "Enjoy your #{coffeeMachine.brand} #{flavor}!"

  # Create a function that adds a new property to the coffeeMachine object
  addProperty = (property, value) ->
    coffeeMachine[property] = value

  # Call the function to add a new property to the coffeeMachine
  addProperty "capacity", "10 cups"

# Use a switch statement to handle the different coffee sizes
switch coffeeMachine.capacity
  when "10 cups"
    console.log "Perfect for hosting parties!"
  when "5 cups"
    console.log "Great for small gatherings."
  else
    console.log "Not sure how many cups this coffee machine can handle."

# Create an array of coffee blends
coffeeBlends = ["vanilla", "hazelnut", "caramel", "mocha"]

# Use the map function to create a new array with the coffee blends capitalized
capitalizedBlends = coffeeBlends.map( (blend) ->
  blend.toUpperCase()
)

# Output the new array with capitalized coffee blends
console.log capitalizedBlends
