### This is a function that prints the first 20 Fibonacci numbers
### The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous ones.
### It starts with 0 and 1, and continues on like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
### This function uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers and print them out.

# Define the function
fibonacci = (n) ->
    # Set up initial variables
    num1 = 0
    num2 = 1

    # Loop through n numbers
    for i in [0..n-1]
        # Print out the current number in the sequence
        console.log(num1)
        
        # Calculate the next number in the sequence
        next = num1 + num2
        
        # Shift the numbers to prepare for the next iteration
        num1 = num2
        num2 = next

# Call the function with n = 20
