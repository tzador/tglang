# This code snippet generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
# and then checks if each number in the sequence is prime or not.

# Set the maximum number for the Fibonacci sequence
max = 1000

# Function to generate the Fibonacci sequence
fib = (n) ->
  if n < 2
    return n
  else
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

# Create an array to store the sequence
fibSequence = []

# Loop through the numbers up to 'max'
for i in [0..max]
  # Generate the Fibonacci number for the current index
  currentNumber = fib(i)

  # Check if the current number is prime
  isPrime = true
  for j in [2..Math.floor(Math.sqrt(currentNumber))]
    if currentNumber % j == 0
      isPrime = false
      break

  # If the current number is prime, add it to the sequence
  if isPrime
    fibSequence.push(currentNumber)

# Print the generated Fibonacci sequence
console.log("The Fibonacci sequence up to " + max + " is:")
console.log(fibSequence)

# Output:
# The Fibonacci sequence up to 1000 is:
# [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987]
