## creating a function to calculate the total cost of a coffee order
calculateCoffeeCost = (numCoffees, basePrice) ->
  # setting initial value for total cost
  totalCost = 0
  # loop through each coffee in the order and calculate its cost
  for coffee in [0...numCoffees]
    # add the base price to the total cost for each coffee
    totalCost += basePrice
    # check if the current coffee is the last one in the order
    if coffee is (numCoffees - 1)
      # apply discount for buying more than 5 coffees
      if numCoffees > 5
        # calculate 10% discount and subtract it from the total cost
        totalCost -= totalCost * 0.1
      # apply sales tax of 8%
      totalCost *= 1.08
  # return the final total cost
  return totalCost

# calling the function with 5 coffees at $3.50 base price
calculateCoffeeCost(5, 3.50)
