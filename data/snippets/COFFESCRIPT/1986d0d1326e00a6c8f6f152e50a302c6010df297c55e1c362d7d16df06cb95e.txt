### This code snippet is a CoffeeScript function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the smallest number in the array.
# The function uses the ternary operator to set a temporary variable as the first element in the array, then iterates through the array to find the smallest number.
# Once the smallest number is found, it is compared to the temporary variable and replaces it if it is smaller.
# Finally, the temporary variable is returned as the smallest number in the array.
  
get_smallest_num = (numArray) ->
  smallest = numArray[0] ?: numArray[1]   # ternary operator to set temporary variable as first element in array
  for num in numArray[1..]                # iterate through array
    if num < smallest                     # check if element is smaller than temporary variable
      smallest = num                      # replace temporary variable with smallest element
  return smallest                         # return temporary variable as smallest number in array
