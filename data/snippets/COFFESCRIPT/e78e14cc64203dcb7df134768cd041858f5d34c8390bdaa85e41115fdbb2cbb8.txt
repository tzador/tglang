### This code snippet uses the COFFESCRIPT programming language to find the average of an array of numbers

# Create an array of numbers
numbers = [4, 2, 6, 1, 9]

# Define a function to calculate the average of an array of numbers
calculate_average = (num_list) ->
  sum = 0 # Initialize the sum variable to 0
  for num in num_list # Loop through the array of numbers
    sum += num # Add each number to the sum
  average = sum / num_list.length # Calculate the average
  console.log "The average of the array is #{average}" # Output the average to the console

# Call the function with the created array as the argument
calculate_average(numbers)

# Output:
# The average of the array is 4.4
