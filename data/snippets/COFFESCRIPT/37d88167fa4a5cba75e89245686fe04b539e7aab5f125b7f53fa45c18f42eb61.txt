### Utilizing 'if' statements, functions, and an external library in COFFESCRIPT ###

# Importing the external 'moment' library
moment = require 'moment'

# Defining a function to check if a user is eligible for a special discount
discountChecker = (age) ->
  if age < 18  # If user is under 18 years old
    console.log "You are not eligible for the discount."
  else if age >= 65  # If user is 65 years old or older
    console.log "You qualify for the senior discount!"
  else  # If user is between 18 and 65 years old
    console.log "You are eligible for a regular discount."

# Getting user's current age
currentAge = parseInt(prompt("How old are you?"))

# Calculating the user's birth year based on current age and the current year
birthYear = moment().subtract(currentAge, 'years').year()

# Printing out the user's birth year
console.log "You were born in #{birthYear}."
