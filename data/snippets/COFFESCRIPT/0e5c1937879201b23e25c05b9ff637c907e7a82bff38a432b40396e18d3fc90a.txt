# This is an example of a complex function in COFFESCRIPT
# Here we are using a class syntax to create the function
class Person
  constructor: (name, age) ->
    @name = name
    @age = age

  # This function returns the person's name and age
  describe: ->
    return "This person is #{@name} and they are #{@age} years old."

# Creating an instance of the Person class with name "John" and age 25
person = new Person("John", 25)

# Calling the describe function on the person instance and storing the output in a variable
description = person.describe()

# Printing the description to the console
console.log(description)

# Output: This person is John and they are 25 years old.
