### Generator function to calculate the prime factors of a given number
genPrimeFactors = (num) ->
  # Initialize an empty array to store the prime factors
  primeFactors = []

  # Keep dividing the number by 2 until it is no longer divisible
  while num % 2 == 0
    # Add 2 to the prime factors array
    primeFactors.push(2)
    # Update the number to be divided
    num /= 2

  # Initialize the divisor to be 3
  divisor = 3

  # Calculate the maximum possible divisor
  maxDivisor = Math.sqrt(num)

  # Keep checking the divisor until it reaches the maximum possible divisor
  while divisor <= maxDivisor
    # If the number is divisible by the divisor, update the number and add the divisor to the prime factors array
    if num % divisor == 0
      primeFactors.push(divisor)
      # Update the number to be divided
      num /= divisor
      # Update the maximum possible divisor
      maxDivisor = Math.sqrt(num)
    # If the number is not divisible by the divisor, increment the divisor by 2
    else
      divisor += 2

  # If the updated number is greater than 1, it is itself a prime factor
  if num > 1
    primeFactors.push(num)
  
  # Return the final prime factors array
  return primeFactors
  
# Call the generator function with the desired number
console.log(genPrimeFactors(84))
