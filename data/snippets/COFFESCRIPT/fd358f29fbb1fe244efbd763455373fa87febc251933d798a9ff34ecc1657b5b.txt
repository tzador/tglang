# Declaring a class called "Animal"
class Animal
  # Create a constructor function inside the class
  constructor: (@name, @age) ->
    # Define instance variables using "this" keyword
    @species = "mammal"
    @habitat = "land"

  # Define an instance method called "eat"
  eat: (food) ->
    # Output a string using string interpolation
    console.log "#{@name} loves to eat #{food}!"

# Instantiate a new "Animal" object with name "Leo" and age 5
leo = new Animal "Leo", 5

# Call the "eat" method on the "Leo" object with "meat" as an argument
leo.eat "meat"

# Output:
# Leo loves to eat meat!
