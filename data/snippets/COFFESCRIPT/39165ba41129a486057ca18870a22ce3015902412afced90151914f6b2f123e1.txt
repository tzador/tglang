# Calculate the area of a circle using user inputs

# Define a function that takes in the radius of a circle
circle_area = (radius) ->
  # Use the formula for calculating the area of a circle (pi * r^2)
  area = 3.14 * (radius * radius)
  # Return the calculated area
  return area

# Prompt the user to input the radius of the circle
radius = parseInt(prompt("Enter the radius of the circle:"))

# Call the circle_area function with the user input as the argument
area = circle_area(radius)

# Print the calculated area to the console
console.log("The area of the circle with a radius of " + radius + " is " + area)

# Output:
