# COFFESCRIPT CODE SNIPPET
# This code snippet implements a class called "Square" which represents a square on a grid.
# It has functions to calculate the area and perimeter of the square.

class Square
    ### This class represents a square with a given side length. ###
    constructor: (@sideLength) ->

    ### This function calculates the area of the square. ###
    area: ->
        @sideLength * @sideLength
    
    ### This function calculates the perimeter of the square. ###
    perimeter: ->
        @sideLength * 4

# Creating a new instance of the Square class with a side length of 5
mySquare = new Square(5)

# Calculating and printing the area and perimeter of the square.
console.log("The area of the square is:", mySquare.area())
console.log("The perimeter of the square is:", mySquare.perimeter())

# Output:
# The area of the square is: 25
# The perimeter of the square is: 20
