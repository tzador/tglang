### Defining a class ###
class Animal
  constructor: (@name, @color)->
    # Constructor function that assigns name and color to animal
    @eat = false
    @sleep = false
     
  # Method to make animal eat
  eatFood: =>
    @eat = true
    console.log("#{@name} is now eating.")
    
  # Method to make animal sleep
  goToSleep: =>
    @sleep = true
    console.log("#{@name} is now sleeping.")

# Creating instances of the Animal class
bunny = new Animal("Flopsy", "white")
kitten = new Animal("Fluffy", "gray")

# Calling methods on instances
bunny.eatFood()
kitten.goToSleep()

# Output: 
# Flopsy is now eating.
# Fluffy is now sleeping.
