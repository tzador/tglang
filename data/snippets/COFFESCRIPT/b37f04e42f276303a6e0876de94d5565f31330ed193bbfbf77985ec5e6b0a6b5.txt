# This function takes in a list of numbers and
# finds the average value

average = (nums) ->
  # Initializing a variable to store the sum of
  # all the numbers in the list
  sum = 0

  # Loop through the list of numbers
  for num in nums
    # Add each number to the sum variable
    sum += num

  # Divide the sum by the length of the list
  # to get the average value
  avg = sum / nums.length

  # Return the average value
  return avg

# Example input list
input_nums = [5, 10, 8, 3]

# Call the average function with the input list
result = average(input_nums)

# Print the result
# Output: 6.5
console.log(result)
