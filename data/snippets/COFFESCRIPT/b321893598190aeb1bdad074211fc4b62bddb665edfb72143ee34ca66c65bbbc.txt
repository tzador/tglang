### Coffeescript Code Snippet ###
# This code snippet creates a class called "Person" with two properties, "name" and "age"
class Person
    constructor: (name, age) ->
        @name = name
        @age = age
        
    # This function checks if the person is above 18 years old
    checkAge: ->
        if @age > 18
            console.log("This person is an adult.")
        else
            console.log("This person is a minor.")

# Instantiating a Person object with name "John" and age 20
person = new Person("John", 20)

# Calling the checkAge() function on the person
person.checkAge()

# Output: "This person is an adult."
