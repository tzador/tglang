# The following code snippet creates a function that 
# takes in an array and returns the sum of all its elements
# in descendant order, using loop iteration and conditional statements.


(sumArray = (arr)->
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    total = 0
    # Iterate through the array in reverse order
    for i in [arr.length - 1..0]
        # Check if element is a number
        if typeof arr[i] is "number"
            # Add element to total
            total += arr[i]
        # If element is not a number,
        # check if it's an array and recursively call sumArray
        else if typeof arr[i] is "object"
            total += sumArray(arr[i])
        # If element is not a number or array,
        # throw an error
        else
            throw new Error("Invalid element type in array")
    # Return the total sum
    return total
)
# Call the function with an example array
sumArray([1, 2, [3, 4], "5"]) # Output: 15
