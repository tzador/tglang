# This is a complex code snippet in COFFESCRIPT that prints out a Fibonacci series

# Function to calculate Fibonacci sequence up to n
genFib = (n) ->
  # Initialize empty array to hold Fibonacci numbers
  fibArr = []

  # Check if n is equal to 1 or 2, as they will return 0 and 1 respectively
  if n == 1
    # Push 0 to the array
    fibArr.push(0)
    # Return the array
    return fibArr
  else if n == 2
    # Push 0 and 1 to the array
    fibArr.push(0, 1)
    # Return the array
    return fibArr
  else
    # Push 0 and 1 to the array as starting values
    fibArr.push(0, 1)
    # Loop from i=2 to n-1 and calculate the Fibonacci number at each index
    for i in [2...n]
      # Calculate the Fibonacci number at index i by adding the two previous numbers in the array
      fibArr[i] = fibArr[i-1] + fibArr[i-2]

    # Return the array
    return fibArr

# Print out the Fibonacci sequence up to 10
console.log(genFib(10))
