# This code snippet is written in ICON programming language
# The purpose of this code is to generate a Fibonacci sequence of a given number
procedure fibonacci(n)
  local a:=1 # first number of sequence
  local b:=1 # second number of sequence
  local c:=0 # variable for calculating third number in sequence

loop
  if n = 1 then

  elsif n = 2 then
    return b # base case, return second number
  else
    for i in 3 to n loop # loop through numbers starting from third in sequence
      c := a + b # calculate next number in sequence
      a := b # assign previous number to first variable
      b := c # assign current number to second variable
    end # end for loop
