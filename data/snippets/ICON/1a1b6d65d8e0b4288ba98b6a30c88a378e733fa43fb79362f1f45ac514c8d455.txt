procedure search (array)
; This procedure takes in an array and performs a linear search algorithm to find a given element

    num = read() ; read the number to be searched for
    found = FALSE ; set initial value of found flag to false

    for i = 1 to sizeof(array) ; loop through each element in the array
        if array[i] = num ; compare current element to target element
            found = TRUE ; if found, set found flag to true
            break ; exit loop
        end
    end

    if found = TRUE ; if element is found
        print "Element found at index " + i ; print index of found element
    else
        print "Element not found" ; if element not found, print error message
    end
