procedure triangle(h = 10, s = 7)
| comment: this is a simple procedure to draw a triangle with user-defined height and side length
|
| local variables:
|   pos_x: current x position of the pen
|   pos_y: current y position of the pen
|   angle: current angle of the pen
|
| initial configuration:
|   pos_x := 0
|   pos_y := 0
|   angle := 0
|   pen_up
|
| main:
|   turn_to(angle, 0)
|   forward(h)
|   turn_to(angle, 120)
|   pen_down
|   repeat 2
|     forward(s)
|     turn_right(120)
|   pen_up
|   turn_to(angle, 0)
