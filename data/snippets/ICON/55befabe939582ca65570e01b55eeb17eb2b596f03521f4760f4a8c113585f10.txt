# $REX Preamble 
#
# This program demonstrates the use of the `loop` statement 
# and shows its versatility by looping through different data types. 
#
# It also utilizes the `switch` statement to handle different cases.
 
procedure main()
 
    # Create an array of numbers to loop through
    numbers = <10.5, 20.2, 30.9, 40.4>
 
    # Loop through the numbers using the `loop` statement
    loop i over numbers
        # Print the value of i
        write(x, "Value of i: ", i)
        # Use `switch` statement to handle different cases
        switch x
            # Case for integer values
            case "int":
                # Cast i to integer and print its value
                write("The integer value of i is ", i)
            # Case for string values
            case "string":
                # Convert i to string and print its value
                write("The string value of i is ", toString(i))
            # Case for floating point values
            case "float":
                # Print i as is
                write("The float value of i is ", i)
