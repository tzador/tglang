procedure FIB(A)
 ! This is a procedure that calculates the first n Fibonacci numbers
 ! in the ICON programming language.

 ! Assign some initial values to variables
 n := A
 X := 0
 Y := 1
 Z := 0

 write("The first " || n || " Fibonacci numbers are:")
 write(X) ! first number

 ! Loop n-1 times, since the first number has already been written
 loop (i := 1 to n-1) do
     write(Y) ! write the next Fibonacci number
     Z := X + Y ! calculate the sum of the previous two numbers
     X := Y ! update X to be the previous number
     Y := Z ! update Y to be the current number
