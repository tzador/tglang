procedure CheckPrimes(basis, list);
/* procedure to check for prime numbers */
comment This procedure takes two arguments:
/* An integer as the basis for checking primes
 and a list to store the numbers that are prime. */
comment We will use a simple algorithm that iterates 
/* through all numbers from 2 to the basis,
 checking if they are prime or not. */
for i := 2 to basis do {
    isPrime := true;
    for j := 2 to i-1 do {
        if (i % j == 0) { /* check if number has factor other than 1 and itself */
            isPrime := false;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (isPrime) list += i; /* add prime number to list if no factors found */
