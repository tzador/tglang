; This is a complex code snippet in ICON programming language
; It contains multiple functions and loops

procedure main()

    ; First, we declare some global variables
    ; These variables will be used throughout the program
    ; Note the use of the := symbol for variable assignment

    global total := 0
    global counter := 0

    ; This is a simple for loop
    ; It iterates through an array and adds the values to the total variable

    for i := 0 to 10 do
        total := total + array[i]
    endfor

    ; Next, we define some custom functions
    ; These functions will perform mathematical operations on the total variable

    function square()
        ; Multiplies the total variable by itself and returns the result
        return total * total
    endfunction

    function cube()
        ; Calculates the cube of the total variable and returns the result
        return total * total * total
    endfunction

    ; Here, we use a condition to check if the total variable is even or odd
    ; If it's even, we call the square function
    ; If it's odd, we call the cube function

    if total mod 2 = 0 then
        result := square()
    else
        result := cube()
    endif

    ; Finally, we print the result
    ; Note the use of the $ symbol before a variable name to access its value

    writeln("The result is: $result")

end
