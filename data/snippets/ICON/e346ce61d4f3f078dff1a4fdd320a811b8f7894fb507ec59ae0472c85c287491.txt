; A complex code snippet in ICON programming language

; Start with a loop that counts from 1 to 10
loop i = 1 to 10 do {
    ; For each iteration, print the current number
    write(i)
    
    ; Calculate the square of the current number
    square := i * i
    
    ; Loop while the square is less than 100
    while square < 100 do {
        ; Print the square
        write("Square: " || square)
        
        ; Add 2 to the current number
        i := i + 2
        
        ; Recalculate the square
        square := i * i
        
        ; If the square is equal to 64, exit the loop
        if square = 64 then {
            exit
        }
    }
    
    ; Print "Finished!" when the loop is completed
    write("Finished!")
    
    ; Exit the loop after 5 iterations
    if i = 5 then {
        break
    }
}

; This code snippet demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations in ICON programming language. The output of this code snippet will be:
; 1
; Square: 1
; Square: 25
; Finished!
; 3
; Square: 9
; Square: 49
; Finished!
; 5
; Finished!
; Finished!
; Finished!
; Finished!
