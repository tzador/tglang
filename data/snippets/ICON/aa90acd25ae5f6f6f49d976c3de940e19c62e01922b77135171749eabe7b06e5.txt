# this code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number

# define main procedure called "factorial"
procedure factorial()
begin
    # ask user for input
    input num

    # initialize factorial variable to 1
    let factorial = 1

    # loop from 1 to num
    for i = 1 to num do
        # multiply factorial variable by current value of i
        let factorial = factorial * i
    end

    # print result
    print "The factorial of", num, "is", factorial
end

# call factorial procedure
