# This is a sample code snippet in the programming language 'ICON'
# This code creates a function that multiplies two numbers and returns the result

procedure main(x,y) {
  sum := 0;  # initialize sum variable to hold result
  if (x >= 0) {  # check if first number is greater than or equal to zero
    copy := x;  # if yes, then create a copy of the first number
  }
  else {
    copy := -x;  # if not, then create a negative copy of the first number
  }
  while (copy > 0) {  # loop through the copy till it reaches 0
    sum := sum + y;  # add the second number to the sum 
    copy := copy - 1;  # decrement the copy by 1
  }
  if (x < 0) {  # if the first number was negative
    sum := -sum;  # then make the sum negative as well
  }
  return sum;  # return the result
}

## Main Function
Hello World;  # print Hello World
result := main(5, 3);  # call the main function with two numbers as parameters
write "The result is: ", result;  # print the result
