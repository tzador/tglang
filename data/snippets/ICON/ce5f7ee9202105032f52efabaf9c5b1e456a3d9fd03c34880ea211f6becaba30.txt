# This code snippet is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

procedure factorial(num)
        # Set the initial value for the factorial as 1
        fac := 1
        # Loop through all the numbers from 1 to num
        for i := 1 to num loop
                # Multiply the current number with the factorial value
                fac := fac * i
        end
        # Return the factorial value
        return fac

# Call the factorial function with the input number
call factorial(6)
# Output: 720
