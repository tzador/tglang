# Simple Example of a Linear Search
# Author: John Smith

procedure linear_search(array, target)
  # Initialize variables for index and found flag
  let index ← 0
  let found ← false
  
  # Loop through the array until target is found or end is reached
  while index < length(array) and not found
    # Check if current element is the target
    if array[index] = target
      # Target found, set found flag to true
      found ← true
    else
      # Target not found, move on to next element
      let index ← index + 1
    end
    
    # Print result if target is found
    if found
      print "Target found at index " || index
    else
      print "Target not found in array"
    end
  end
  
  # Example array and target for testing
  let arr ← [5, 2, 7, 3, 9]
  let target ← 7
  
  # Call linear search procedure with array and target
  linear_search(arr, target)
  
  # Output: "Target found at index 2"
