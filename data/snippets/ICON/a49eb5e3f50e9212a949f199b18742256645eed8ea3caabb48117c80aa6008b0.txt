procedure Sum(num1,num2)
; This is a procedure that calculates the sum of two numbers.
; Input: two numbers, num1 and num2
; Output: the sum of num1 and num2
s := num1 + num2 ; assigning the sum of num1 and num2 to variable s
return s ; returning the value of s as the output
end


function Factorial(n)
; This is a function that calculates the factorial of a number.
; Input: a number, n
; Output: the factorial of n
result := 1 ; initializing the result variable to 1
while n > 0 do
   result := result * n ; multiplying the result by n
   n := n - 1 ; decrementing n by 1
end
return result ; returning the value of result as the output
end


program Main
; This is the main program that calls the Sum and Factorial procedures/functions.
begin
   num1 := 5 ; assigning the value 5 to num1
   num2 := 3 ; assigning the value 3 to num2
   x := Sum(num1,num2) ; calling the Sum procedure and assigning the value to variable x
   y := Factorial(4) ; calling the Factorial function and assigning the value to variable y
end
