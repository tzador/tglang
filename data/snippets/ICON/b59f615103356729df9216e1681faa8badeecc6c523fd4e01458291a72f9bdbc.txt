# My ICON Program
### This is a long and complex code snippet written in the ICON programming language

# Define some variables
str1 = 'Hello'
str2 = 'World'
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

# Concatenation of strings
concat_str = str1 || " " || str2
# Output: Hello World

# Addition of numbers
addition = num1 + num2
# Output: 15

# Print the results
printf("Concatenated string: %s\n", concat_str);
printf("Addition result: %d\n", addition);

# Loop from 1 to 10
for i:=1 to 10 do
{
    # Check if i is divisible by 3
    if i mod 3 = 0 then
    {
        # Print 'Fizz' if it is divisible by 3
        printf("Fizz\n");
    }
    # Check if i is divisible by 5
    if i mod 5 = 0 then
    {
        # Print 'Buzz' if it is divisible by 5
        printf("Buzz\n");
    }
    # Check if i is divisible by both 3 and 5 ('FizzBuzz' case)
    if i mod 3 = 0 and i mod 5 = 0 then
    {
        # Print 'FizzBuzz' if it is divisible by both 3 and 5
        printf("FizzBuzz\n");
    }
    # If none of the condition is true, print the current number
    else
    {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
