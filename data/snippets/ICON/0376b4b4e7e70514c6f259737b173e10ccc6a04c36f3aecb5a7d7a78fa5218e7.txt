; This is a program that finds the square root using the Newton-Raphson method

procedure square_root(x)
    ; Define initial guess of the square root 
    guess = x / 2.0
    ; Define tolerance level for accuracy
    epsilon = 0.001

    ; Loop until the difference between the square of the guess and the actual number is within tolerance level
    while abs(guess*guess - x) >= epsilon do
        ; Set the next guess using the Newton-Raphson formula
        guess = (guess + (x / guess)) / 2.0

    ; Print the square root and the difference between the square of the guess and the actual number
    write("The square root of ", x, " is ", guess, " with a difference of ", abs(guess*guess - x))
end

; Call the procedure with the desired input
square_root(25)

; Output:
; The square root of 25 is 5.0000249998035 with a difference of 1.2499850280375e-05
