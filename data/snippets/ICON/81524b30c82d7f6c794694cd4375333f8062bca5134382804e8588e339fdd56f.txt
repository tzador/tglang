procedure countFibonacci(initialVal1, initialVal2, maxTerms)
;; This procedure counts the number of terms in a Fibonacci sequence
;; starting at initialVal1 and initialVal2, up to a maximum of maxTerms.
;; Parameters:
;;   initialVal1: the first term in the sequence
;;   initialVal2: the second term in the sequence
;;   maxTerms: the maximum number of terms to be counted
