# Program to calculate the volume of a sphere
# This is a complex code snippet in ICON language

procedure main()

        # Declaration of variables
        integer radius
        number pi
        number volume
        
        # Read radius from user input
        prompt "Enter radius: " radius
        
        # Calculate pi up to 10 decimal places
        pi := arctan(1) * 4
        
        # Calculate volume of sphere using formula
        volume := 4/3 * pi * pow(radius, 3)
        
        # Output the result
        write "Volume of sphere with radius " radius " is " volume
        
end # end of main procedure
