; This is a code snippet in ICON, a high-level programming language that is similar to Pascal and ALGOL.
; It is used for creating programs on the ICON computer system.

procedure fibonacci(n)      ; This is a recursive function that calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
if n < 2 then               ; Checks if n is less than 2, which means the number is 0 or 1.
    return n                ; Returns 0 or 1 depending on the value of n.
else                        ; If n is greater than or equal to 2, the function will recursively call itself until n is 0 or 1.
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) ; Calls the function twice, passing in n-1 and n-2, and adding the results.

procedure main()            ; This is the main function that will be executed when the program is run.
    let n = 5               ; Define the value of n, in this case we will use 5.
    let result = fibonacci(n) ; Calls the fibonacci function passing in n as an argument and stores the result in the variable result.
    print("The " || n || "th number in the Fibonacci sequence is " || result) ; Prints the result in a human-readable format.
end                         ; Ends the main function.

main()                      ; Calls the main function to start the program execution.
