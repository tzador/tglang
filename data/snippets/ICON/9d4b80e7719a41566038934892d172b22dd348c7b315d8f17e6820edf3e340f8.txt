#This is an example of a program in ICON demonstrating control structures

#Declare a variable named "count" and assign a value of 0
count := 0

#Loop through the numbers 1 to 10
for i in 1 to 10 do {
    #If the current number is even, increment the count variable
    if i % 2 = 0 then {
        count := count + 1
    }
    #If the current number is odd, print it out
    else {
        write(i)
    }
}

#If the count variable is greater than 5, print "More even numbers"
if count > 5 then {
    write("More even numbers")
}

#If the count variable is less than 5, print "More odd numbers"
elsif count < 5 then {
    write("More odd numbers")
}

#If the count variable is equal to 5, print "Equal number of even and odd numbers"
else {
    write("Equal number of even and odd numbers")
}

#Display a message to indicate the end of the program
write("End of program.")
