# This code snippet generates a random 16-character password using the ICON programming language

# First, we import the necessary functions from the ICON standard library

PROC(MyPWD)

# We declare a constant array containing all possible characters for the password
# We also initialise a count variable that will keep track of the number of characters added to the password

ARR: chars[0-9a-zA-Z] = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
INT: count = 0

# We use a for loop to iterate 16 times, adding a randomly selected character from the array to the password each time

FOR i = 0 TO 15 DO
    # We use the ICON random function to generate a random index within the range of the array
    index = RANDOM() MOD 62
    
    # We add the character at the generated index to the password string
    password = password || chars[index]
    
    # Increment the count variable
    count := count + 1
    
    # We also add an annotation to indicate the character that was added to the password at each iteration
    # This will help us verify the randomness of the password later
    // Added character: chars[index]
    
# We use another for loop to ensure that the password contains at least one uppercase, lowercase, and numeric character

FOR j = 0 TO 2 DO
    # We generate a random index again
    index = RANDOM() MOD 62
    
    # We check if the character at that index is already present in the password
    # If not, we add it to the password
    IF NOT password CONTAINS chars[index]
        password = password || chars[index]
        
        # Increment the count variable
        count := count + 1
        
        # Add an annotation
        // Added character: chars[index]
        
# Finally, we shuffle the characters in the password to make it more secure and unreadable

# We use the ICON shuffle function, which takes in a string and returns a shuffled version of it
password = SHUFFLE(password)

# Once the password is generated, we print it to the console for the user to see
OUTPUT("Your randomly generated password is: " || password)
