ICON is a high-level programming language that was developed in the 1970s to create interactive systems. It uses English-like syntax and has the capability to manipulate icons (graphical symbols) in addition to regular text. Below is an example of a code snippet in ICON that takes a list of numbers, divides them by the next number in the list, and prints the results.
