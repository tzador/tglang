# This code snippet calculates the global average by taking two inputs and performing a series of calculations.
# The result is then returned as the final output.
# Inputs:
#     - input: Number of elements in the first set
#     - output: Number of elements in the second set
# Output:
#     - average: The calculated global average
# 
# Example:
# calculate_global_average(5, 3)
# Output:
# 85
