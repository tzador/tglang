; This code snippet is written in ICON programming language

procedure factorial (n)
    {
    ; This procedure calculates the factorial of a given integer
    ; Input: n - an integer
    ; Output: factorial - the factorial of n
    }

    ; Declare and initialize variables
    factorial := 1     ; initialize the factorial variable to 1
    num := n           ; initialize the num variable to n

    ; Loop through numbers from 1 to n
    for i in (1 to n) do {
        factorial := factorial * num ; calculate factorial by multiplying it with num
        num := num - 1               ; decrement num by 1 in each iteration
    }

    ; Output the factorial
    RETURN factorial
end

; Call the factorial procedure and store the result in result variable
result := factorial(5)

; Output the result
PUT("The factorial of 5 is: " || result)
