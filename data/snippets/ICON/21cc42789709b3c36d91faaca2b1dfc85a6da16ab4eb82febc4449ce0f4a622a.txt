# Here is a program in ICON that prints numbers in a Fibonacci sequence
procedure fibonacci(n)      # creates a procedure named "fibonacci" that takes in one argument, n
while n > 0 do              # initiates a while loop that runs while n is greater than 0
  prev1 := 1                # sets the value of variable prev1 to 1 
  prev2 := 0                # sets the value of variable prev2 to 0
  for i := n to 0 by -1 do  # initiates a for loop that runs from n to 0 in decreasing order, with a step of -1
    next := prev1 + prev2   # calculates the next number in the sequence by adding prev1 and prev2
    prev2 := prev1         # updates the value of prev2 to be equal to prev1
    prev1 := next          # updates the value of prev1 to be equal to the next number in the sequence
  write(prev1)             # prints the current number in the sequence, which is stored in prev1
  n := n - 1               # updates the value of n, decreasing it by 1 for the next iteration
end                        # ends the for loop
end                        # ends the procedure

fibonacci(10)              # calls the fibonacci procedure and passes in 10 as the argument
# Output: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
