; This program calculates the factorial of a given integer

; define procedure to calculate factorial
procedure factorial(num)
  ; initialize result variable
  let result := 1

  ; loop through each number up to given number
  for i := 1 to num
    ; multiply result by current number
    let result := result * i

  ; output the final result
  print("The factorial of " || num || " is " || result)

; call the factorial procedure, passing in the desired number
factorial(5)
