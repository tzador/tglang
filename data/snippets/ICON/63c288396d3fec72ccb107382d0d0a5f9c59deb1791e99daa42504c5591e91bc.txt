This code snippet is a sample of an ICON program that defines a main procedure which iterates through a loop 20 times and calls the display function for each iteration. The display function takes in an integer and a string as parameters and prints a message to the output. After the loop, the main procedure checks the options variable and calls different procedures based on its value. The do_something, do_something_else, and do_nothing procedures simply print different messages to the output. This code snippet showcases the use of procedures, loops, conditions, and functions in the ICON language.
