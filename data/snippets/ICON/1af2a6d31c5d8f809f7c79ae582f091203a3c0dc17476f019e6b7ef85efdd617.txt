# This is a sample code snippet in ICON programming language #

# The following code snippet contains a function to find the factorial
# of a given number using recursion #

# This function takes in one parameter, the number whose factorial needs to be found #
proc factorial(n)    	
|'' This is the starting case of the recursion, where the factorial of 0 is 1
    if n = 0 then		
    	return 1
    else
    	|'' This is the recursive call to the function, where the factorial
    	|'' of n is calculated by calling the function with n-1 as the parameter
    	return n * factorial(n-1)
   end
end

# The following code snippet demonstrates the use of the factorial function
# by finding the factorial of the numbers 1 to 10 #

# This loop iterates through the numbers 1 to 10 #
for i in 1 to 10
	out("The factorial of " || i || " is " || factorial(i))	
end
