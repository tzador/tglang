--- Procedure for calculating the factorial of a given number ---

procedure factorial(x)
  --- Perform preliminary checks ---
  if x = 0 then
    return 1
  end

  if x < 0 or x = INTEGER_MAX then
    --- Handle error ---
    output "Error: Input number out of range"
    return NIL
  end

  --- Initialize count variable ---
  n := 1
  --- Initialize result variable ---
  result := 1

  --- Loop through numbers from 1 to x ---
  loop while n < x + 1
    --- Calculate factorial by multiplying current result by current number ---
    result := result * n
    --- Increment count variable ---
    n := n + 1
  repeat

  --- Return final result ---
  return result
