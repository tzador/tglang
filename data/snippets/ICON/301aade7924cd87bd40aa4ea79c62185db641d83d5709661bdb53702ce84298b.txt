;; This code snippet computes the factorial of a given number.

procedure factorial(n)
  ; initialize counter and product variables
  i := 1;
  product := 1;
  
  loop while i <= n do
    ; multiply product by current value of i
    product := product * i;
    
    ; increment counter
    i := i + 1;
  end

  ; print result
  write("Factorial of " || n || " is " || product);
end
