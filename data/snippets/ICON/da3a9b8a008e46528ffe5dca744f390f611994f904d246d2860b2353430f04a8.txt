; This code snippet uses ICON programming language to generate a Fibonacci sequence
; Starting with the initial values for the first two numbers in the sequence
; and then using a for loop to iterate and calculate the next number in the sequence
; Output will be printing the entire sequence up to a user-defined index

procedure fibonacci_sequence(index)
{
    define initial_value_1 = 0;  # initial value for the first number in the sequence
    define initial_value_2 = 1;  # initial value for the second number in the sequence
    define sequence = [initial_value_1, initial_value_2];  # create a list to store the sequence values
    for i = 2 to index do {  # start iterating from index 2 since we already have the first two values
        define next_value = sequence[i-2] + sequence[i-1];  # calculate the next value by adding the previous two values
        sequence = sequence || next_value;  # add the next value to the end of the sequence list
    }
    print("Fibonacci Sequence up to index: ", index);  # print the sequence up to the user-defined index
    print(sequence);  # print the entire sequence list
}

# To generate Fibonacci sequence up to index 10:
fibonacci_sequence(10);

# Output:
# Fibonacci Sequence up to index 10: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
