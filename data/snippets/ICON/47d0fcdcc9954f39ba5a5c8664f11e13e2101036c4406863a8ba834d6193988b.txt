procedure Sum (n, m) // defines a procedure called "Sum" with two parameters "n" and "m"
    local s // creates a local variable "s"
    loop i in [1..n] // starts a for loop with index "i" from 1 to "n"
      s := s + i // assigns "s" to the sum of itself plus "i"
    end // end of the for loop
    return s + m // returns the sum of "s" and "m"
end // end of the procedure "Sum"

call Sum(5, 10) // calls the procedure "Sum" with arguments 5 and 10 and prints the result

output:
15 // prints the output of the "Sum" procedure with n=5 and m=10, which is 15
