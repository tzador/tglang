procedure generate_sequence(n)

  ;* This procedure takes in a number n and generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to n
  ;* and prints them out in order
  ;* Inputs:
  ;*     n - the maximum number in the sequence
  ;* Outputs:
  ;*     None

  nums := []                  ; This will hold the sequence of numbers

  for i := 1 to n do          ; Loop from 1 to n
    nums := nums || [i]       ; Append the current number to the list

  std::put("Sequence: ")      ; Print out the label
  for num in nums do          ; Loop through the sequence of numbers
    std::put(num || " ")      ; Print each number followed by a space
  endfor
