procedure HelloWorld()
  write("Hello World!")

; This is a function that takes in two arguments and returns their sum
procedure sum(a, b)
  ; The variables a and b are passed in as arguments
  ; and are automatically assigned values when the function is called
  return a + b
end

; This is a procedure that checks if a given number is prime
procedure isPrime(n)
  ; Use the built-in function "mod" to check if n is divisible by any number between 2 and n-1
  for i := 2 to n - 1 do
    if n mod i = 0 then
      return false
    end
  end

  ; If the loop completes without returning false, n is a prime number
  return true
end

; An example of calling the functions and procedures
