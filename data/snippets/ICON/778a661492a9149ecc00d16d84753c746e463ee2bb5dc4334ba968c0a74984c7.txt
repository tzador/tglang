\\ First we define two variables, x and y, with respective initial values of 10 and 5
\\ These variables will be used for mathematical operations later on
x := 10
y := 5

\\ Next, we declare a procedure called "calculate" which takes in two parameters: a and b
\\ It performs a series of calculations using the variables defined earlier and returns the result
procedure calculate(a, b)
\\ We create a local variable, result, which will store the output of our calculations
result := (x + y) * a - (y * b)

\\ Print the result to the screen
say "The result is: " || result

\\ Call the calculate procedure with specific arguments (3 and 2 in this case)
calculate(3, 2)

\\ Output:
\\ The result is: 35
