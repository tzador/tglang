procedure calculate_statistics

;;; This procedure calculates the average of
;;; a given list of numbers and returns it.
;;; It also reports the maximum and minimum
;;; values in the list as additional statistics.

input L -> array ;;; the list of numbers to be analyzed

;;; initialize variables for calculations
let sum = 0
let max = -1 ;;; assume all numbers are positive
let min = 100 ;;; assume all numbers are less than 100

;;; loop through the list

    if array[I] < min then
        min := array[I] ;;; update min if smaller number found
