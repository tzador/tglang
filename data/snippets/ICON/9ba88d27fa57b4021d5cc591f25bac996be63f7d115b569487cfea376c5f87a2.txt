// Example program in ICON programming language
/*
The ICON programming language is a high-level language designed for creating complex applications.
It is known for its unique features such as a powerful string processing system and built-in data structures.

This code snippet demonstrates the use of conditional statements, functions, and built-in data structures in ICON.

/*
Define a function to calculate the average value of a given list of numbers.
The function expects a list of numbers as input and returns the average value as a float.
*/
procedure calculate_average(numbers)
{
    total = 0 // Initialize a variable to store the sum of all numbers
    size = len(numbers) // Get the number of elements in the list
    
    // Iterate through the list of numbers and add each number to the total
    for i in 1:size do {
        total += numbers[i]
    }
    
    // Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of elements
    average = total / size
    
    // Return the average value
    return average

// Create a sample list of numbers
numbers = [5,13,8,21,34]

// Call the calculate_average() function and store the returned value in a variable
result = calculate_average(numbers)

// Print the result
"{result} is the average of the numbers {numbers}"

/*
Output:
"16.2 is the average of the numbers [5,13,8,21,34]"
