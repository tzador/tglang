procedure reverse(a)			;This procedure reverses a given array
	num := length(a)			;Gets the length of the array
	for i := 0 to (num/2) do	;Loops through half of the array
		temp := a[i]			;Store current element in temp variable

//Example usage:
a := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]		;Initialize an array
b := reverse(a)				;Call the reverse procedure on array a and store the result in array b
//Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]	;Prints the reversed array b as output
