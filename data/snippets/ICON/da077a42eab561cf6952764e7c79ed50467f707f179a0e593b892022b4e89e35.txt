; This code snippet uses the ICON programming language
; It prints the first 20 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence
procedure main()
    integer n := 20           ; set the number of elements to print
    integer prev := 0         ; set the first element of the sequence
    integer curr := 1         ; set the second element of the sequence

    printf("Fibonacci sequence: \n")

    for i := 0 to n do        ; loop through the number of elements
        printf("%d\n", prev)  ; print the current element
        integer next := prev + curr ; calculate the next element in the sequence
        prev := curr          ; update the previous element
        curr := next          ; update the current element
