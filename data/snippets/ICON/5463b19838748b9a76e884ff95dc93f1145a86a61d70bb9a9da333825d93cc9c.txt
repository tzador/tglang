; This is a sample code snippet in the programming language 'ICON'
; It uses a complex algorithm to generate a Fibonacci sequence

procedure FibonacciSeq(len)
len and 2 <:= n ; start with a length greater than 2
every odd(len) := n +:= 1 every 2(len) := n +:= 2
; initialize the first 2 elements of the sequence
seq[1] := 0         seq[2] := 1

clear result ; clear the result list
every n := 3 to len seq[n] := seq[n-1] + seq[n-2] add the current element to the result list
result || seq[n] ; concatenate the current element to the result list
; this whole process is repeated until the desired length is reached

#result ; output the final list of Fibonacci sequence
