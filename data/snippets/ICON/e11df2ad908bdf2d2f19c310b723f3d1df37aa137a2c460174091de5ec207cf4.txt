; This code snippet prints a list of prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
; Define a variable N with the number of prime numbers to be generated
N := 20

; Define a list L with the first N positive integers
L := 1 to N
 
; Define a list P to keep track of prime numbers
P := empty
 
; Set index i to 2, the first prime number
i := 2
 
; Loop until i^2 is greater than or equal to N
while(i^2 < N)
    for x in L
        ; If x is divisible by i and is not equal to i, remove it from the list
        if (mod(x, i) = 0 and x != i)
            L => x
    
    ; Add i to the prime list P
    P => i
 
    ; Increment i to the next prime number
    i := i + 1
 
; Print the list of prime numbers P
P
