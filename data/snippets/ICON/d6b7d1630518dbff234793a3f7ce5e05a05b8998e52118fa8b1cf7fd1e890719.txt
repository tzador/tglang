#This code snippet is a simple example of how to use the ICON programming language to generate a list of prime numbers from 1 to 100
#The program uses for loops and if statements to determine if a number is prime or not


procedure main()

#initialize variables
number := 2
prime_flag := true

#loop through numbers 2 to 100
for i := 2 to 100 step 1 do

    #assume number is prime until proven otherwise
    prime_flag := true

    #check if number is divisible by any other number
    for j := 2 to i-1 step 1 do

        #if number is divisible by j, it is not prime
        if i % j = 0 then
            prime_flag := false

            #break out of inner for loop
            break
        end if
    end for

    #if number is prime, print it
    if prime_flag then
        print(i)
    end if

end for

end procedure
