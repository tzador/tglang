; This code snippet is a function in the ICON programming language
; It takes in two parameters, 'num1' and 'num2', and returns their sum as the output
; Assumes that the parameters are valid numbers
; Sample input: num1 = 4, num2 = 7
; Sample output: 11

function sum(num1, num2)
{
    ; Checks if the parameters are valid numbers
    ; '?' is the ternary operator in ICON
    num1 = num1 ? num1 : 0
    num2 = num2 ? num2 : 0
    
    ; Initialize a variable to store the sum
    ; '::' is the assignment operator in ICON
    result:: 0
    
    ; Loop through the first number 
    ; ';;' is used for loop control in ICON
    ; Here, 1 is added to num1 every iteration 
    ; 'result +=' is the shorthand for 'result := result + num1'
    for (num1 := num1; num1 < 0 ;; num1 += 1)
        result += num1
    
    ; Loop through the second number 
    ; Here, 1 is subtracted from num2 every iteration  
    for (num2 := num2; num2 > 0 ;; num2 -= 1)
        result += num2
    
    ; Return the result
    result
}
