;my code snippet in ICON

;define a procedure named "sum" that takes in two parameters
procedure "sum"(a,b)
  ;initialize a variable "total" to store the sum
  total := 0
  ;condition to check if a and b are both numbers
  if (numeric?(a) and numeric?(b)) then
    ;loop through a to b and add each number to total
    for i := a to b do
      total := total + i
  ;if a or b is not a number, print an error message
  else
    "Invalid input. Please provide numbers."
  ;return the total
  return total
;end of procedure

;call the procedure and save the result in variable "output"
output := sum(1, 10)
;print the result
print("The sum from 1 to 10 is:", output)
