;; This is a code snippet in ICON, a high-level programming language used for general-purpose symbolic computation

;; define a function named "fibonacci" that takes in a single parameter "n" representing the index of a fibonacci number to be calculated
procedure fibonacci(n)

  ;; variables to keep track of the current and previous fibonacci numbers
  integer current := 1
  integer previous := 0
  
  ;; loop n times
  loop for n do

    ;; swap the current and previous fibonacci numbers
    integer temp := current
    current := previous
    previous := temp

    ;; calculate the next fibonacci number by adding the current and previous numbers
    current += previous

  end

  ;; return the nth fibonacci number
  return current

end

;; call the "fibonacci" function with the argument 5 and assign the result to a variable "result"
integer result := fibonacci(5)

;; print the result
write("The 5th fibonacci number is ${result}")
