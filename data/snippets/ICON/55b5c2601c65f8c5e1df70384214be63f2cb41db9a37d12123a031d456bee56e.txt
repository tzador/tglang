# This is a sample code snippet in ICON programming language #

# Assign a list of numbers to a variable #
numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Loop through each number in the list #
FOR i IN numbers:

    # Check if number is even #
    IF MOD(i, 2) = 0:

        # Print number with label #
        PRINT "Number: " || i
        
        # Nested loop to print the square of the number #
        FOR j IN numbers:
        
            # Calculate square of the number #
            square: i * j
            
            # Print the square with label #
            PRINT "Square: " || square
            
    # If number is odd #
    ELSE:
    
        # Print number with label #
        PRINT "Number: " || i
        
        # Nested loop to print the cube of the number #
        FOR j IN numbers:
        
            # Calculate cube of the number #
            cube: i * j * j
            
            # Print the cube with label #
            PRINT "Cube: " || cube
            
    # End of loop #
