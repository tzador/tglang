#The above code snippet follows the ICON programming language syntax and is a procedure to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It takes two arguments, a and b, and uses a while loop to iterate until the second argument becomes 0. Inside the loop, a temporary variable is used to store b, and b is reassigned the value of the remainder of a/b. The value of a is then assigned the original value of b. This process continues until b becomes 0, and at that point, the GCD (stored in variable a) is returned.
