procedure factorial(n) # Defines a procedure called factorial that takes in parameter 'n'
  integer result := 1 # Initializes a variable 'result' with value 1
  loop i := 1 to n # Starts a loop from 1 to n
    result := result * i # Multiplies result by the current value of i
  end # Ends loop
  write(result) # Outputs the final result
end # Ends procedure
