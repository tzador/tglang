# This is a simple ICON program that creates a list
# and prints out each item in the list

# Define the list of items
list ITEMS
"Item 1"
"Item 2"
"Item 3"

# Define a variable to keep track of the position in the list
integer position := 0

# Loop through the items in the list
while position < total(ITEMS) do {
    # Get the item at the current position in the list
    string item := get(ITEMS, position)

    # Print out the item
    write("The item at position ", position, " is: ", item)

    # Increment the position variable
    position := position + 1
}

# Output:
# The item at position 0 is: Item 1
# The item at position 1 is: Item 2
# The item at position 2 is: Item 3
