; This is a sample code snippet in ICON programming language.
; It implements a bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order.

; Define a procedure for the bubble sort algorithm
procedure bubble_sort(list)
[
  ; Create variables used in the algorithm
  num_elements := length(list);
  swapped := true;

  ; Use a while loop to continuously loop through the list until it is fully sorted
  while(swapped)
  [
    ; Set swapped to false at the beginning of each loop
    swapped := false;

    ; Use a for loop to compare adjacent elements and swap if necessary
    for i := 0 to num_elements - 2 do
    [
      ; Check if the current element is greater than the next element
      if(list[i] > list[i+1])
      [
        ; Swap the elements
        temp := list[i];
        list[i] := list[i+1];
        list[i+1] := temp;

        ; Set swapped to true to indicate a swap occurred
        swapped := true;
      ]
    ]

    ; Decrement num_elements as the last element will already be sorted
    num_elements := num_elements - 1;
  ]
]

; Initialize a list of integers for testing
list := [5, 2, 8, 3, 9, 1, 4];

; Call the bubble sort procedure to sort the list
bubble_sort(list);

; Output the sorted list to the console
list;

; Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9]
