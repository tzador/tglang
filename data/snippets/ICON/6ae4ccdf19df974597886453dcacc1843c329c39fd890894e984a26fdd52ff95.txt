# This code snippet illustrates how to use recursive functions in ICON programming language

procedure fibonaci(n)

    # Check base cases
    if n = 0 or n = 1 then
        return n

    # Recursive call to calculate fibonaci of n-1 and n-2
    else
        return (fibonaci(n-1) + fibonaci(n-2))

end

# Use a loop to print the first 10 numbers in the fibonaci sequence
for i in 0:10 do
    fib = fibonaci(i)
    write "Fibonaci of ", i, " is ", fib
end
