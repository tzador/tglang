procedure multiply
; This procedure multiplies two numbers and stores the result in variable 'c'
; Input: a, b (numbers to be multiplied)
; Output: c (product of a and b)
 
; Initialize variables
c := 0
 
; Loop while b is greater than 0
while b < 0 do {
    ; Add a to c
    c := c + a
 
    ; Decrement b by 1
    b := b - 1
}
 
; Return c as the product of a and b
return c
