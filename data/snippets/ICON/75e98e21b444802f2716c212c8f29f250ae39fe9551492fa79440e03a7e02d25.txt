This code snippet is an example of a procedure that utilizes logic and conditionals in the ICON programming language. The procedure, called 'hide', takes in the name of a widget as input and checks if it exists on the screen. If it does, the widget is moved off the screen and the screen is updated. If the widget is not found, an error message is displayed.

After the hiding process, the code then checks if the widget is actually hidden or not. If it is hidden, a message is displayed. If it is not hidden, the 'hide' procedure is called to hide the widget.

Finally, a while loop is used to continuously check if the widget is still active. While it is, events are executed and the loop continues. Once the widget is no longer active, the procedure ends.
