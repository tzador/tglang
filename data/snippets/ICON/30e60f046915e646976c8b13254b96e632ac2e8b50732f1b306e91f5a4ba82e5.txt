procedure sum(arr, n) ## defines a procedure called sum with parameters arr and n on a single line
    local i, total ## declares local variables i and total on a single line
    i := 1 ## assigns the value 1 to the variable i
    total := 0 ## assigns the value 0 to the variable total
    while i <= n do [ ## starts a while loop that runs as long as i is less than or equal to n
        total := total + arr[i] ## assigns the value of total plus the value at index i in the array arr to the variable total
        i := i + 1 ## increments the value of i by 1
    ] ## ends the while loop
    return total ## returns the value of the variable total
end ## ends the procedure definition
