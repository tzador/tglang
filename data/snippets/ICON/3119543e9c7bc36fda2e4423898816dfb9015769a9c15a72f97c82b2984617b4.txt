; This is a code snippet in the ICON programming language
; It is a simple program that generates a random number between 1 and 100
; It takes in user input to determine the maximum number in the range
; and then uses a built-in ICON function to generate a random number within that range

procedure random_number()
    ; This procedure takes in user input to determine the maximum number in the range
    max_num := read("Enter the maximum number in the range: ")
    ; Uses the built-in 'random()' function to generate a random number within the range
    random_num := random(max_num)
    ; Prints the generated random number to the user
    print("Your random number is: ", random_num)
end

; Calls the 'random_number()' procedure to generate a random number
call random_number()
