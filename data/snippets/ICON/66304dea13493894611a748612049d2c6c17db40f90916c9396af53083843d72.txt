/*

This code snippet is a basic program written in the programming language ICON.
It defines a MAIN procedure with two arguments, arg1 and arg2.
Two variables, i and j, are declared as local variables.
The loop statement runs from i = 0 to j, and with each iteration, it prints out the values of i and j.
After each iteration, i is incremented by 1.
The program ends after the loop finishes executing.
