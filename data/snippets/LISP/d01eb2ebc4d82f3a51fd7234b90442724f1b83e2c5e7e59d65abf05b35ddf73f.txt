;;; This is a function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion. 

(defun factorial (number)   ;;; Creates a function named factorial which takes in a parameter 'number'
  (if (= number 0)          ;;; Checks if the number is equal to 0 
      1                     ;;; If yes, returns 1 as factorial of 0 is 1
      (* number (factorial (- number 1))))) ;;; If no, calls the factorial function with number-1 and multiplies it with current number

(factorial 5) ;;; Calling the function with input 5
 
;;; Output: 120 ;;; Since 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
