;;; A recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number

(defun factorial (n) ; define a function named "factorial" that takes in one argument "n"
  (if (<= n 0)      ; if the value of "n" is less than or equal to 0
      1             ; then return 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; otherwise, multiply "n" by the result of calling the "factorial" function with "n-1" as the argument

;;; Example usage:
(factorial 5) ; calling the "factorial" function with 5 as the argument will return 120
