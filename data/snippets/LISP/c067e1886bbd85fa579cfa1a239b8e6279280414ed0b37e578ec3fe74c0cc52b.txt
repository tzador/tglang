; This code snippet creates a function called 'factorial' that calculates the factorial of a number
; Factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (or (null n) (<= n 1)) ; checks if n is null or less than 1, returns 1 if true
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; multiplies n with factorial of n-1 recursively

(factorial 5) ; calling the function with the argument 5
; This returns 120, which is the factorial of 5 (5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)
