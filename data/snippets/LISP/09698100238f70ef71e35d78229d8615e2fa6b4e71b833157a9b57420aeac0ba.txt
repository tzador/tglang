;; Define a recursive function to compute the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (<= n 1) ; If n is less than or equal to 1
      1 ; Then return 1 as the base case
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; Else multiply n by the recursive call with n-1

;; Set the value of n to 5 and call the factorial function
(let (n 5)
  (print (factorial n)))

;; Output:
; 120
