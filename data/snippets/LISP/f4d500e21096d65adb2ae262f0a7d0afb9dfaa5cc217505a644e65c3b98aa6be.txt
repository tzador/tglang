;; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n)                     ; define a function named "factorial" with an input argument "n"
  (if (= n 1)                           ; if the value of "n" is equal to 1
      1                                 ; return 1 (base case)
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))       ; otherwise, multiply the value of "n" with the factorial of one less than "n"
 
(factorial 5)                           ; call the "factorial" function with the input argument 5, prints 120
