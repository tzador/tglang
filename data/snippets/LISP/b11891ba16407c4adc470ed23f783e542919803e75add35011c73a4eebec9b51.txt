;;; The following code snippet creates a function called "double-list" that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number doubled.

(defun double-list (list)
  "Takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number doubled"
  (let ((doubled-list '()))
    (dolist (num list) ;;; Iterates through each number in the list
      (push (* 2 num) doubled-list)) ;;; Multiplies each number by 2 and adds it to the new list
    (reverse doubled-list))) ;;; Reverses the list to maintain the original order of the numbers

(double-list '(1 2 3 4 5)) ;;; Output: (2 4 6 8 10)
