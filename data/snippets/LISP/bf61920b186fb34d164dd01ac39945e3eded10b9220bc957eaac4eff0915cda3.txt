;; Define a function that takes in a list and returns the sum of all elements in the list
(defun sum (lst)
  (if (null lst)  ;; If the list is empty,
      0 ;; return 0 (the base case)
      (+ (car lst) (sum (cdr lst))) ;; Add the first element of the list to the sum of the rest of the elements
    )
)

;; Define a list of numbers
(setq numbers '(1 2 3 4 5))

;; Call the sum function on the list and print the result
(format t "The sum of ~A is ~A" numbers (sum numbers))

;; Output: The sum of (1 2 3 4 5) is 15
