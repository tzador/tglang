;; An example function that returns the factorial of a given number
;; Takes in one parameter, n, and returns the factorial of n
(defun factorial (n)
  ;; Sets the initial value of result to 1
  (setf result 1)
  ;; A loop to iterate from 1 to n
  (loop for i from 1 to n do
    ;; For each iteration, multiply the current value of result by the iteration number
    (setf result (* result i)))
  ;; Return the final value of result
