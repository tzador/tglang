;; The following code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

(defun factorial (n)
    "Calculates the factorial of a given number."
    (if (<= n 1)
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
    )
)

;; Recursive function to calculate factorial
(factorial 5) ; returns 120 (5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)
