;; This is a complex LISP code snippet that uses recursion and higher-order functions
;; to find the product of the first n natural numbers.

;; Define a higher-order function that takes in a function f, starting point x, ending point y,
;; and an operation op. The function will recursively apply the operation to each number
;; between x and y, and return the final result.
(defun apply-operation (f x y op)
  (if (> x y)
      1
      (funcall op (funcall f x) (apply-operation f (+ x 1) y op))))

;; Define the factorial function using recursion.
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (<= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

;; Use the apply-operation function to find the product of the first n natural numbers
;; by passing in the factorial function as the f parameter, and the multiplication
;; function as the op parameter.
;; In this case, we want to find the product of numbers from 1 to n,
;; so x is 1, y is n, and the f and op functions are already defined.
(apply-operation factorial 1 n #'*)

;; Output: The result will be the product of the first n natural numbers.
