;; Define a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n)    ;; Define the function name and parameter
  (if (= n 0)           ;; Check if n is equal to 0
      1                 ;; If n is equal to 0, return 1 as factorial of 0 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))   ;; If n is not equal to 0, multiply n by the factorial of n-1
))

;; Example call: (factorial 5)
;; Output: 120 (5! = 120)
