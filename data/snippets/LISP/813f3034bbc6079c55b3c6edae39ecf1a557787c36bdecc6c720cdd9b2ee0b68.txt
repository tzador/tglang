;; This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the smallest number
(defun smallest (list)
    (let ((smallestnum (car list)))
        (dolist (num list)
            (when (< num smallestnum) ; This checks if the current number is smaller than the smallest number
                (setq smallestnum num))) ; If so, set the smallest number to the current number
        smallestnum)) ; Finally, return the smallest number
