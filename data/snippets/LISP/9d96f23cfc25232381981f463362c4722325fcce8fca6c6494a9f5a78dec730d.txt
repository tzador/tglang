;;; A sample function in LISP

;;; This function takes in an integer n and returns its factorial

(defun factorial (n)

      1             ;; if it is, then return 1 as its factorial
      (* n (factorial (1- n)))) ;; if not, then recursively call the function by reducing the value of n by 1 and multiplying it with the result of factorial(n-1)
