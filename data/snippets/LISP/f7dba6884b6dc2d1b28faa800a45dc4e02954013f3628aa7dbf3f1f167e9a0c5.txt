;; Defining a function to calculate the factorial of a number in LISP
(defun factorial (n)
  ;; Base case: if n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1
  (if (or (zerop n) (= n 1))
      1
      ;; Recursive call to calculate factorial using tail recursion
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
  )
)

;; Example usage: calculating factorial of 5
(factorial 5) ; Output: 120
