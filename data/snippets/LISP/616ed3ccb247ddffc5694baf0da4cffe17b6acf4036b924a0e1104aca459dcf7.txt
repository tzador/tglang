;; Define a function for calculating the factorial of a number.
;; This function will use recursion to iteratively multiply the number
;; by the factorial of the previous number until it reaches 1.
(defun factorial (n)

    (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ;; Multiply it by the factorial of the previous number.

;; Call the function with an input of 5 and print the result.
(print (factorial 5)) ;; Output: 120
