(defun quicksort (list) ; This is a function named 'quicksort' which takes in a 'list' as a parameter
  (if (null list) ; Checks if the list is empty 
    list ; Returns the list if it is empty
    (let (pivot (first list)) ; Defines the pivot as the first element of the list
      (append ; Appends the output of the following sub-expressions
        (quicksort ; Recursive call to quicksort
          (remove-if-not ; Removes elements from the list that do not satisfy the predicate
            (lambda (x) (<= x pivot)) ; Checks if each element in the list is less than or equal to the pivot
            (rest list))) ; Calls rest function to return the list without the first element
        (list pivot) ; Adds the pivot to the end of the list
