; Function for finding the fibonacci series up to a given number

(defun fibonacci (n) ; defining a function called 'fibonacci' that takes in an argument 'n'
    (if (<= n 1) ; recursive if statement that checks if n is less than or equal to 1
        n ; if n is 0 or 1, return n as the value in the fibonacci series
        (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2))) ; using recursion to calculate the previous two elements in the fibonacci series and adding them together
    )
)

(fibonacci 10) ; calling the function and passing in the number for which the fibonacci series needs to be calculated
