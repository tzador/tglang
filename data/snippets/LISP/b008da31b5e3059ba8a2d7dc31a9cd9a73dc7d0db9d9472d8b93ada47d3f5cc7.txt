;; This code snippet is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
;; The name of the function is "factorial", which takes one parameter, "num"
(defun factorial (num)
  (if (<= num 1) ;; checks if num is less than or equal to 1
    1 ;; if true, returns 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
    (* num (factorial (- num 1))) ;; if false, multiplies num with the factorial of num - 1
  )
) ;; end of function
