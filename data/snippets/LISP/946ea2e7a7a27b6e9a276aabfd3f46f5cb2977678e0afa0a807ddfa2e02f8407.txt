;; The following code snippet defines a function called "merge-sort" that takes in a list as an argument and returns a sorted sublist.
;; It uses the divide and conquer strategy to recursively split and merge the sublists until a sorted list is produced.

(defun merge-sort (lst)
  "This function performs a merge sort on a list, returning a sorted sublist."
  (if (<= (length lst) 1)
      ;; If the list contains only one element, return it
      lst
      ;; Otherwise, divide the list into two sublists
      (let ((left (subseq lst 0 (/ (length lst) 2)))
        (right (subseq lst (/ (length lst) 2))))
        ;; Recursively call merge-sort on both sublists
        (merge (merge-sort left) (merge-sort right)))))

;; The following snippet creates a test list and calls the merge-sort function on it.
(let ((test-list (list 5 3 9 2 7)))
  (merge-sort test-list))
