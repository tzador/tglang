(defun fibonacci (n) ;;; This is a function named 'fibonacci' that takes in one parameter 'n'
  (if (< n 2) ;;; This is an 'if' statement checking if 'n' is less than 2
      n ;;; If 'n' is less than 2, return 'n'
      (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))) ;;; If 'n' is not less than 2, recursively call 'fibonacci' on 'n-1' and 'n-2' and add the two results
;;; This is the end of the function 'fibonacci'
