(defun factorial (n) "Calculates a factorial of a number.
 This is a recursive function, meaning it calls itself until it reaches a base case.
 Input: n - the number to calculate the factorial of
 Output: the factorial of n"

    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))) ; recursive call to factorial function, multiplying n by the factorial of n-1
