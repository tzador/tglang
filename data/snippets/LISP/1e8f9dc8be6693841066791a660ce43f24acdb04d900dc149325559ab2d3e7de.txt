;; This is a sample code snippet in LISP

;; Declare a list of numbers
(setf numbers '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))

;; Define a function to multiply each number in the list by 2
(defun multiply-numbers (list)
  "Multiplies each number in the list by 2."
  (if (null list)
      nil
      (cons (* 2 (car list))
            (multiply-numbers (cdr list)))))

;; Call the function and print the output
(format t "Multiplied numbers: ~a" (multiply-numbers numbers))
