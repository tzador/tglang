;; An example of a complex LISP code snippet
;; This code snippet will calculate the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n)                                 ;; Define a function named "factorial" with one parameter n
  (if (<= n 1)                                        ;; If n is less than or equal to 1

      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))                      ;; Else, multiply n with the factorial of (n-1) and return the result
