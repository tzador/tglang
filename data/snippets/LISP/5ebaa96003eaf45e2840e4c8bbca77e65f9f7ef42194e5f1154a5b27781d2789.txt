;;Function to calculate the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (equal n 1)
    1 ;;Base case: factorial of 1 is 1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ;;Recursively calls the function with n-1 as an argument

(factorial 5) ;;Calls the function factorial with the argument 5 and returns the result
;;Output: 120 ;;Factorial of 5 is 120 (5*4*3*2*1)
