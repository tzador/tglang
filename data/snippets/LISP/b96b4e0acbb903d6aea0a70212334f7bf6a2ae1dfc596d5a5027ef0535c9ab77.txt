;; Define a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (<= n 1) ; If n is less than or equal to 1
      1  ; Return 1 as the factorial of 1 is 1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; Else, multiply n with the factorial of n-1

;; Calculate and print the factorial of 5
(print (factorial 5)) ; Output: 120

;; Define another function to calculate the sum of all numbers in a list
(defun sum-list (list)
  (if (null list) ; If the list is empty
      0  ; Return 0 as the sum
    (+ (car list) (sum-list (cdr list))))) ; Else, add the first element with the sum of the remaining elements

;; Calculate and print the sum of a list containing numbers from 1 to 5
(print (sum-list '(1 2 3 4 5))) ; Output: 15
