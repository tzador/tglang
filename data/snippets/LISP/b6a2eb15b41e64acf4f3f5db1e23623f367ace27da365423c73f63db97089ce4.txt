;; The following code snippet creates a recursive function in LISP that computes the factorial of a given number.
;; It uses the built-in 'cond' function to check for base cases and the 'defun' function to define the recursive function.

(defun factorial (n) ; Function definition with one parameter 'n'
  (cond ; Conditional statement for base cases
    ((equal n 0) 1) ; If 'n' is equal to 0, return 1
    ((equal n 1) 1) ; If 'n' is equal to 1, return 1
    (t ; Otherwise (if 'n' is greater than 1)
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; Multiply 'n' with the factorial function called on 'n-1'
    )
  )
)

;; Example usage: (factorial 5)
;; Output: 120
