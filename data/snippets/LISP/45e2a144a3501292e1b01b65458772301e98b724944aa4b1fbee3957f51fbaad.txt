;; This function calculates the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n) ; Defining the function and taking in one parameter 'n'
  (if (= n 0) ; Condition to check if n is equal to 0
      1 ; If the condition is true, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; If the condition is false, multiply n with the factorial of n-1
   ) ; Closing parenthesis for if statement
) ; Closing parenthesis for function definition

;; Example usage
(factorial 5) ; Calculates the factorial of 5, which is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120. Output: 120

;; Output of the same function with different inputs
(factorial 0) ; Output: 1
(factorial 1) ; Output: 1
(factorial 3) ; Output: 6
