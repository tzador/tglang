;;; This is a complex LISP code snippet
;;; It demonstrates the use of lambda functions, recursion, and lists

(defun factorial (n) ;;; Function to calculate factorial of a number
  (if (<= n 1) 1     ;;; Base case: If n is equal to or less than 1, return 1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ;;; Recursive case: Multiply n by the factorial of n-1

(defun exponential (power) ;;; Function to calculate exponential of a number
  (lambda (n) ;;; Returns a lambda function that takes in a number n
    (if (<= n 1) 1 ;;; Base case: If n is equal to or less than 1, return 1
      (* power ((exponential power) (- n 1)))))) ;;; Recursive case: Multiply power by the exponential of n-1

(let ((my-numbers '(2 4 7 3 5))) ;;; Variable my-numbers is a list of numbers
  (mapcar (exponential 3) my-numbers)) ;;; Using mapcar, apply exponential function with power of 3 to each element in my-numbers list
;;;; Output: (8 64 343 27 125)
