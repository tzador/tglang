;;; Return the sum of the squares of two numbers

;;; First we define a function, square, to calculate the square of a number
(defun square (x)                ;;; Define function "square"
  (* x x))                       ;;; Return the square of "x" by multiplying it by itself

;;; Now we can define another function, sum-of-squares, to calculate the sum of squares for two numbers
(defun sum-of-squares (x y)      ;;; Define function "sum-of-squares" with two parameters: "x" and "y"
  (+ (square x) (square y)))     ;;; Add the squares of "x" and "y" together

;;; Example:
(sum-of-squares 2 3)            ;;; Output: 13  (2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13)
(sum-of-squares 5 7)            ;;; Output: 74  (5^2 + 7^2 = 25 + 49 = 74)
