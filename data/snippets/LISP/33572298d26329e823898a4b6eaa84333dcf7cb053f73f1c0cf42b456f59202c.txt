; This is a complex LISP code snippet that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number

; This is a helper function that takes three parameters:
; n: the number whose factorial is to be calculated
; acc: the accumulator that keeps track of the current total
; fact: the current factorial value being calculated

(defun factorial-helper (n acc fact)
  ; Using a cond statement to check if the current number is 0
  (cond ((= n 0) fact)
        ; If the number is not 0, it multiplies the current factorial value with
        ; the current number and calls the helper function with the reduced
        ; number and updated factorial value
        (T (factorial-helper (- n 1) (* acc n) fact))))

; This is the main factorial function that calls the helper function with the
; initial values of the number and the accumulator as 1, and factorial as 1

(defun factorial (n)
  ; Calling the helper function with n, 1 as the initial accumulator value, and 1 as the initial factorial value
  (factorial-helper n 1 1))
