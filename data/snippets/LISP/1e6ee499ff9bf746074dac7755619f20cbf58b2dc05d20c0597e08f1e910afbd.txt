A simple function to determine if a number is even or odd |#

(defun even-or-odd (x) ; Define a function named 'even-or-odd' that takes in one parameter 'x'
  (if (zerop (mod x 2)) ; Check if the parameter 'x' is divisible by 2
      (format t "~D is even" x) ; if yes, print this statement with the value of 'x'
      (format t "~D is odd" x))) ; if not, print this statement with the value of 'x'

;; Example call of the function 
(even-or-odd 10) ; Output: 10 is even
(even-or-odd 7) ; Output: 7 is odd
