;; This code creates a function to calculate the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n) ; defines the function "factorial" with one parameter, "n"
  (if (<= n 0) ; checks if n is less than or equal to 0
      1 ; returns 1 if n is 0 or negative
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; multiplies n with the result of the function called recursively with n-1 as argument
