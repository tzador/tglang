; Code to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion
 
; Define a function called factorial that takes in one parameter, n
(defun factorial (n)
  ; Check if n is equal to 1 (base case)
  (if (= n 1)
      ; If n is equal to 1, return 1
      1
      ; If n is not equal to 1, recursively call factorial function with n-1 and multiply it with n
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))
 
; Call the factorial function with input 6 and print the result
(print (factorial 6))
