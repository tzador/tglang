; Function to calculate the factorial of a number

(defun factorial (n)         ; Define the function 'factorial' with one parameter 'n'
    (if (<= n 1)             ; Perform conditional check, if n is less than or equal to 1
        1		     ; Return 1 which is the base case for factorial
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; If not, multiply n with the factorial of n-1 using recursion

; Example call to the function, calculating the factorial of 5
(factorial 5)       ; Output: 120
