;; This code defines a function named "calculate" that takes in three parameters, a, b, and c, and returns the calculation a + (b * c).
(defun calculate (a b c) ; define function named calculate
  (let ((sum (+ a (* b c)))) ; use "let" to set local sum variable to the calculation a + (b * c)
    (format t "The sum is: ~a~%" sum) ; use "format" to print the sum with a new line
    sum)) ; return the sum
