;; This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n) ;define a function named factorial that takes in one argument
  (if (<= n 1) ;conditional statement, checks if n is less than or equal to 1
      1 ;if true, return 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ;if false, multiply n by the factorial of n-1 and return the result
