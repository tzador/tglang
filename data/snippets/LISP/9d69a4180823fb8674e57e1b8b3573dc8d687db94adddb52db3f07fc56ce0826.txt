;; Define a function to find the nth Fibonacci number
(defun fibonacci (n)
    "Returns the nth Fibonacci number"
    (if (<= n 1)

;; Declare some variables and call the function with different values
(setq x 0)
(setq y (fibonacci 5))
(setq z (fibonacci (+ x y)))

;; Print the results
(format t "The 5th Fibonacci number is ~a." y) ; Output: The 5th Fibonacci number is 5.
(format t "The sum of the 3rd and 5th Fibonacci numbers is ~a." z) ; Output: The sum of the 3rd and 5th Fibonacci numbers is 8.
