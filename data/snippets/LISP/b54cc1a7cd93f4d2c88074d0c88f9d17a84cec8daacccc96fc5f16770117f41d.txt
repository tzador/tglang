;; Define a recursive function to find the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n) 
    (if (<= n 1) ; checks if n is less than or equal to 1
        1 ; base case, factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; recursive case, multiplies n by the factorial of n-1
    )
)

(factorial 5) ; call the factorial function with n = 5, should output 120

;; Output: 120
