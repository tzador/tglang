; This is a function that takes in two parameters x and y and returns the sum of their squares
(defun sum-squares (x y)
  (let ((square-x (** x 2)) ; finding the square of x
        (square-y (** y 2))) ; finding the square of y
    (format t "The squares of ~a and ~a are: ~a and ~a~%" x y square-x square-y) ; printing the squares for illustration purposes
    (+ square-x square-y))) ; returning the sum of the squares as the output of the function
