;; This code snippet uses recursion to implement the merge sort algorithm
;;The merge function takes two sorted lists and merges them into one sorted list 
(defun merge (list1 list2)
  (if (null list1)
      list2
      (if (null list2)
          list1
          (if (< (car list1) (car list2))
              (cons (car list1) (merge (cdr list1) list2))
              (cons (car list2) (merge list1 (cdr list2)))
          )
      )
  )
)

;; The merge-sort function uses recursion to split the list into smaller sublists
;; and then calls the merge function to merge them back together in sorted order
(defun merge-sort (list)
  (if (or (null list) (null (cdr list)))
      list
      (let ((mid (floor (length list) 2)))
        (merge (merge-sort (subseq list 0 mid))
               (merge-sort (subseq list mid))
        )
      )
  )
)

;; Example usage and output
(merge-sort '(5 2 8 1 9 3))
;; => (1 2 3 5 8 9)
