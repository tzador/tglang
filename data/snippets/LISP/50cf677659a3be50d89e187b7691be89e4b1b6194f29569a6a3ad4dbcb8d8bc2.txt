;; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number

;; Define a function called 'factorial' that takes in one parameter, 'n'
(defun factorial (n)
  ;; Use a conditional statement to check if 'n' is equal to 0
  (if (= n 0)
    ;; If 'n' is equal to 0, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
    1
    ;; If 'n' is not equal to 0, use recursion to call the 'factorial' function again
    ;; with 'n-1' as the parameter and multiply it with 'n'
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

;; Call the 'factorial' function with the value 5 and print the result
(print (factorial 5))
