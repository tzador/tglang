;;; This is a LISP code snippet that creates a function to calculate the factorial of a number

(defun factorial (n) ;;; Define a function named factorial that takes in a parameter 'n'
  (if (<= n 1) ;;; Conditional statement that checks if n is less than or equal to 1
      1 ;;; If true, return 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
      (* n (factorial(n-1))))) ;;; If false, recursively call the factorial function and multiply it by n

(factorial 5) ;;; Call the factorial function with the input of 5, which will return the factorial of 5 (120)

;; Output: 120
