;; This is a code snippet in LISP that creates a function to calculate the factorial of a number

;; Define the function with one parameter, n
(defun factorial (n)
  ;; If n is less than or equal to 1, return 1 (base case)
  (if (<= n 1)
      1
      ;; If n is greater than 1, call the function recursively with n-1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))  ; End of function, close the parenthesis

;; Call the function and pass in the input value, 5
(factorial 5)  ; Output: 120 (5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120)
