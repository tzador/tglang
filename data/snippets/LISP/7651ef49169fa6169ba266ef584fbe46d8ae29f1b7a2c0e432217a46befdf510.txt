;;This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the product of all the numbers in the list.
 
(defun product (list)
 (if (null list) 1
  (* (car list) (product (cdr list)))))
 
;;Defining a variable to hold the result of the product function
 
(let ((result (product '(1 2 3 4))))
  (format t "~a" result))
 
;;Output: 24, since 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
