;; This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n) ;; Defines a function named "factorial" with one parameter "n"
  (if (zerop n) ;; Checks if the value of n is equal to 0
      1 ;; If n is 0, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ;; Otherwise, multiply n with the factorial of n-1
