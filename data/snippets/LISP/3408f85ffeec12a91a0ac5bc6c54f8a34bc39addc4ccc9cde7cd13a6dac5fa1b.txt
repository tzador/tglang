;;; This is a sample code snippet in LISP
(defun sum (list) ;; defines a function named "sum" with parameter "list"
  (if (null list) ;; checks if the list is empty
      0 ;; if the list is empty, return 0
      (+ (car list) (sum (cdr list))) ;; if not, adds the first element of the list with the result of calling sum recursively on the rest of the list
  )
)

(sum '(1 2 3 4)) ;; calls the "sum" function with a list as argument
;; outputs 10, the sum of the elements in the list (1+2+3+4)
