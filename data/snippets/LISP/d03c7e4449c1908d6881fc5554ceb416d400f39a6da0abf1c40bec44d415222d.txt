;; This code snippet creates a function in Common Lisp that checks if a number is prime
(defun primep (n) ;; Define a function named "primep" with the parameter "n"
  (if (<= n 1) ;; Check if the number is less than or equal to 1
      nil      ;; If yes, return nil (not prime)
      (do ((i 2 (+ i 1)))  ;; Use a do-loop with the variable i starting at 2 and incrementing by 1 each time
          ((> i (isqrt n)) ;; Loop until i is greater than the integer square root of n
           t)              ;; If the loop finishes, return true (prime)
        (if (= (mod n i) 0) ;; Check if n is divisible by i (i.e. if n has a factor other than 1 and itself)
            nil             ;; If yes, return nil (not prime)
            t))))           ;; If no factors are found, return true (prime)

;; Example usage:
(primep 17) ;; This function call would return 't' since 17 is a prime number
