;; This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number.
;; It uses the concept of tail recursion to avoid stack overflow.

(defun factorial (n)
  (if (< n 1)
      1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
;; This function takes in an integer and checks if it's less than 1.
;; If it is, 1 is returned as the factorial of 0.
;; If not, the function multiplies n with the factorial of n-1, and repeats until n equals 1.
;; This ensures that the function will not exceed the maximum recursion depth, preventing stack overflow.
