;; Define a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number.
;; Usage: (fib [n]), where n is the number of terms you want in the sequence
(defun fib (n)
  (let ((seq (list 0 1))) ; Create a list to store the sequence, with the first two terms already filled
    (dotimes (i (1- n)) ; Loop n-1 times, each time adding the next term to the sequence
      (setf seq (append seq (list (+ (nth (- i 1) seq) (nth i seq)))))) ; Append the next term to the sequence by adding the previous two terms
    seq)) ; Return the completed sequence as a list

;; Example: (fib 10) returns the first 10 terms in the Fibonacci sequence: (0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34)
