  "Function to calculate the exponent of a given number.
   Takes in two inputs, the base and the exponent.
   Uses recursion to calculate the exponent.
   Returns the result as the output."

    1                   ; if true, returns the value of 1
    (* base (calculate-exponent base (- exponent 1))))) ; if false, multiplies the base by the result of the function with the exponent reduced by 1

(let ((base (read)))    ; prompts the user for the base input
