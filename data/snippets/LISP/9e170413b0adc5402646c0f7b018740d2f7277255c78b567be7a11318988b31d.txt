;; Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (equal n 0)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

(factorial 5) ;=> 120
;; This function takes in a parameter 'n' and checks if it is 0, if it is equal to 0, 1 is returned, else the value of n is multiplied by the result of the function called recursively with n-1 as the parameter.
;; Output: 120, the factorial value of 5 calculated using the factorial function.
