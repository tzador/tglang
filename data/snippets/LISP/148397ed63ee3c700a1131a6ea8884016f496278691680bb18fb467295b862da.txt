;;;; A program that computes the factorial of a number

; Define a function called `factorial` that takes in one parameter `num`
; `fact` will be used as a counter to keep track of the factorial value
(defun factorial (num)
  (let ((fact 1))
    ; Multiply `fact` by each number from 1 to `num`
    (loop for i from 1 to num do
      (setf fact (* fact i)))
    ; Return the factorial value
    fact))
  
; Call the `factorial` function and assign the result to the variable `result`
(setf result (factorial 5))

; Print the result
(format t "The factorial of 5 is ~a" result)
