; A function to calculate the factorial of a given number
; Takes in one parameter n and calculates n!
(defun factorial (n)
    (if (equal n 0) ; Base case, if n is equal to 0
        1 ; Return 1, as 0! is defined as 1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; Recursive case, multiplies n with the factorial of n-1
