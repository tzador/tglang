;; This is a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
;; It takes in one parameter, n, which represents the position of the number in the sequence.
;; At each step, the function checks if n is equal to 0 or 1, as these are the base cases for the sequence.
;; If n is equal to 0 or 1, the function simply returns the value of n.
;; Otherwise, it uses the let statement to define two variables, fib-1 and fib-2, which store the results of recursively calling the fibonacci function on n-2 and n-1, respectively.
;; Finally, the function adds these two variables together to get the nth Fibonacci number.
