;; This code snippet uses recursion to find the factorial of a number in LISP

(defun factorial (n) ; defines a function named "factorial" with parameter "n"
  (if (= n 0) ; checks if "n" is equal to 0
      1 ; the base case, returns 1 when "n" equals 0
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; recursive case, multiplies "n" by the factorial of "n-1"
  )
)

(print (factorial 5)) ; prints the factorial of 5 (120) to the console
