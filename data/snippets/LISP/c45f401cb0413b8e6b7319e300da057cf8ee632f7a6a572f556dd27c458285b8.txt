;; This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given integer n
;; It uses recursion to calculate the factorial, which means it calls itself
;; with a smaller input until it reaches the base case of n = 0
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (= n 0) 1                          ; if n = 0, return 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))        ; otherwise, multiply n by n-1 factorial

;; Example usage: calculating factorial of 5
(factorial 5)   ; should return 120
