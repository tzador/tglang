; This is a comment in LISP
; Define a function called factorial that takes in a number
; and recursively calculates its factorial
; Example: (factorial 5) => 120

(defun factorial (num) ; Start defining the function
  (if (= num 0)  ; Check if num is equal to 0
      1 ; If it is, return 1
      (* num (factorial (- num 1))))) ; Otherwise, multiply num by factorial(num-1)
