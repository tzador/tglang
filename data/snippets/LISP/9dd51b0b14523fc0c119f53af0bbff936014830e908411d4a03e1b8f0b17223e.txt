;; The following code snippet defines a function called 'polynomial' that takes in two parameters:
;; 'x', which is the value of the variable in the polynomial, and
;; 'coefficients', which is a list of coefficients in descending order of the polynomial's terms.
;; The function uses recursion to compute and return the value of the polynomial at the given value of 'x'.

(defun polynomial (x coefficients)
    (cond 
        ;; If the 'coefficients' list has only one element, which is the constant term, return that element
        ((= (length coefficients) 1) (car coefficients))

        ;; If the 'coefficients' list has more than one element, compute the value of the polynomial for the given 'x'
        (t
            (+ (car coefficients) (* x (polynomial x (cdr coefficients)) (expt x (- (length coefficients) 1))))))

;; Sample call to the function with a polynomial '2x^3 + 5x^2 + 3x + 4'
(polynomial 2 '(2 5 3 4)) ;; Output: 34
