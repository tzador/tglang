;; Define a function that takes in two parameters and returns the larger of the two numbers
(defun larger-number (num1 num2)
  (if (> num1 num2) ;if statement to check if num1 is larger than num2
      num1 ;if condition is true, return num1
      num2 ;if condition is false, return num2
  )
)

;; Call the function and pass in two numbers as parameters
(larger-number 5 10) ;outputs 10 as the larger number because 10 is larger than 5
