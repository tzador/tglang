;; This code snippet demonstrates a function that takes two arguments, a list and a number, and returns a new list containing only the elements of the original list that are greater than the given number.
(defun filter (list num) ; Define a function named 'filter' with two parameters, 'list' and 'num'
  (cond ; Start a conditional statement
    ((null list) nil) ; If the given list is empty, return nil
    ((> (car list) num) ; Else if the first element in the list is larger than the given number
      (cons (car list) (filter (cdr list) num))) ; Return a new list with the first element in the original list and the result of recursively calling the function with the rest of the list
    (t ; Else
      (filter (cdr list) num)))) ; Call the function recursively with the rest of the list
