;; This code snippet generates a list of even numbers up to a given limit
;; using the do loop and recursion
(defun generate-even-list (limit) ; define a function with one parameter - the limit
  (do ((i 0 (+ i 2)) ;; initialize an index variable i to 0, increment it by 2 with every loop iteration
       (result '())) ;; initialize an empty list to store our results
      ((>= i limit) (reverse result)) ;; stop the loop when i is greater than or equal to the limit, reverse the list to get the correct order
    (setq result ;; set the value of result to
         (cons i result)))) ;; add i to the front of the list by cons-ing it to result
