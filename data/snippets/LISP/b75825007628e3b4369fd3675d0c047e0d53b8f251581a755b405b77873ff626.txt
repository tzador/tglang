(defun f (x y) ; Defines a function named 'f' that takes in two parameters, x and y.
  (cond ((and (not (= x 0)) (= (/ x y) 0)) ; Checks if x is not equal to 0 and the division of x by y is equal to 0.
         t) ; If the condition is true, returns the boolean value 't'.
        ((null y) ; Checks if y is null.
         (error "Division by zero")) ; If the condition is true, throws an error stating division by zero.
        (t ; This is the 'else' part of the 'cond' statement.
         (f (- x 1) (- y 1))))) ; Calls the function 'f' recursively with the parameters x-1 and y-1.
