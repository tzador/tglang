;; This code snippet uses recursion to find the maximum element in a list

;; Define a function to find maximum element that takes in a list
(defun find-maximum (list)
    (if (rest list) ;; checks if there are more than one elements in the list
        (max (first list) (find-maximum (rest list))) ;; if there are more than one element, recursively call the function
        (first list))) ;; if only one element is left, return it as the maximum


;; Define a helper function to find maximum between two elements
(defun max (a b)
    (if (> a b) ;; checks if a is greater than b
        a ;; if a is greater than b then it is the maximum
        b)) ;; else b is the maximum
