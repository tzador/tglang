The function takes in a list and an item as parameters, and uses the let* statement to initialize variables for the start, end, and whether the item is found in the list. The do loop is used to iterate through the list, updating the middle index and checking if the middle value equals, less than, or greater than the target item. If the item is found, the loop is terminated and the index is printed, if not, the loop continues until either the item is found or the end reaches the start.
