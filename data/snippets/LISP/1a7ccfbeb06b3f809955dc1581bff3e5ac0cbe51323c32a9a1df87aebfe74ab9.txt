;; Define a recursive function that computes the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n) ; define the function with parameter n
    (if (= n 0) ; check if n is equal to 0
        1 ; if yes, return 1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))) ; otherwise, multiply n by the factorial of n-1 and repeat until n is equal to 0

;; Call the factorial function with an input of 5 and print the result
(print (factorial 5)) ; prints 120 (the factorial of 5) to the console
