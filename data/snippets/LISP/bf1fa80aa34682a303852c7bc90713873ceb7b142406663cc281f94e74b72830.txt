; This code snippet implements a recursive function to calculate
; the factorial of a given number.
; Function name: FACTORIAL
; Parameters: num (integer)
; Returns: fact (integer)
; Dependencies: None
; Assumptions: num is a positive integer
; Annotation:
; The function checks if the given number (num) is equal to 1, if it is
; then it returns the factorial value, i.e. 1.
; If the number is not equal to 1, then it calls itself recursively with
; a decreasing value of the number (num - 1) and multiplies it with the
; current value of num, until it reaches 1.
(defun factorial (num)
  ; Base case: if num is 1, then factorial value is 1
  (if (= num 1)
      1
      ; Recursive case: call factorial function with num - 1 and multiply it with current num value
      (* num (factorial (- num 1)))))
