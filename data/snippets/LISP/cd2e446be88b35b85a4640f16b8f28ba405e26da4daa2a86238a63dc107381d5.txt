;; This is a code snippet that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion in LISP

;; Define a function called 'factorial' with one parameter 'n' which represents the number to be calculated.
(defun factorial (n)
  ;; Check if the number is equal to 0, if it is, return 1.
  (if (= n 0) 
    1
    ;; If not, recursively call the factorial function with n-1 and multiply it by n.
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
    
;; Call the factorial function with the number 6 and print the result.
(print (factorial 6))

;; Output: 
;; 720 (6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720)
