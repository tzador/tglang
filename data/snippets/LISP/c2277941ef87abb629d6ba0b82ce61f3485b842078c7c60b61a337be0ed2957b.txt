(defun factorial (n) ; Defines a function called 'factorial' that takes in one parameter 'n'
  (if (= n 0) ; Checks if 'n' is equal to 0
      1 ; Returns 1 if 'n' is equal to 0
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; Otherwise, multiplies 'n' with another call to the 'factorial' function passing in 'n-1' and returns the result
These are the steps carried out by the 'factorial' function:
1. The function checks if the input 'n' is equal to 0.
2. If it is, then the function returns 1.
3. Otherwise, the function multiplies 'n' with another call to itself, passing in 'n-1' as the new input.
4. This process is repeated until 'n' becomes 0 and the final result is returned.
