;; This code snippet uses recursion to compute the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n) ; Defining a function named "factorial" with the parameter "n"
  (if (= n 1) ; Base case: if n is equal to 1
      1 ; return 1 (factorial of 1 is 1)
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; recursively call the function with n-1 and multiply it with n
