(defun factorial (n) ; defines the function 'factorial' which takes in a parameter 'n'
  (if (<= n 1) ; checks if n is less than or equal to 1
      1 ; returns 1 if n is less than or equal to 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; multiplies n with the result of the factorial of (n-1) and returns it
