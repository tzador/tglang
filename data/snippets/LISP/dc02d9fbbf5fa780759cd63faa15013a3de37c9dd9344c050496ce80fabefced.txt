;;;; defining a function to calculate the average of three numbers

(defun average (num1 num2 num3)
  "This function takes in three numbers and returns the average"
  (/ (+ num1 num2 num3) 3))
  ; This line uses the division operator '/' to add the three numbers and divide by 3

;;;; calling the function and storing the result in a variable
(defvar average num1 num2 num3 "result from the average function")

;;;; printing the result
(write (format "The average of the three numbers is ~a." average))
