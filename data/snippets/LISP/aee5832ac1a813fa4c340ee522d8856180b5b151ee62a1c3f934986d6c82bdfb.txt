(defun factorial (n) ; Define a function named 'factorial' that takes in one argument, 'n'
    "Computes the factorial of n." ; A docstring explaining what the function does
    (if (= n 0) ; Use 'if' statement to check if n is equal to 0
        1 ; If n is equal to 0, return 1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; If n is not equal to 0, multiply n with the factorial of (n-1) and return the result
