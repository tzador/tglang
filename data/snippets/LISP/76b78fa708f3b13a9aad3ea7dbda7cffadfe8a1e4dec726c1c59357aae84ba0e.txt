;;; Function to calculate the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
;;; Input: n (integer)
;;; Output: nth term (integer)
(defun fibonacci (n) ; define a function named fibonacci that takes in a parameter n
  (if (<= n 1) ; if n is less than or equal to 1
      n ; return n as it is (first and second terms of the sequence are 0 and 1 respectively)
      (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2))) ; else recursively call fibonacci function with n-1 and n-2 and add the two values to get the nth term
  )
)
(fibonacci 10) ; call the fibonacci function with the input of 10 to get the 10th term in the sequence
;;; Output: 55
