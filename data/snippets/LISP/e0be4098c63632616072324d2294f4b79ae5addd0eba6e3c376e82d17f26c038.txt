;;; This program is a simple text-based calculator written in LISP
;;; It takes two numbers and an operator as input and outputs the result

;;; Define a function to take user input for the first number
(defun first-number-input ()
  (format t "Enter the first number: ")
  (setq first-number (read)))

;;; Define a function to take user input for the second number
(defun second-number-input ()
  (format t "Enter the second number: ")
  (setq second-number (read)))

;;; Define a function to take user input for the operator
(defun operator-input ()
  (format t "Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): ")
  (setq operator (read)))

;;; Define a function to perform the calculation using the two numbers and the operator
(defun calculate (first-number operator second-number)
  (cond ((eq operator '+) (+ first-number second-number))
        ((eq operator '-) (- first-number second-number))
        ((eq operator '*) (* first-number second-number))
        ((eq operator '/) (/ first-number second-number))
        (t (format t "Invalid operator chosen."))))

;;; Call the functions to take user input and perform the calculation
(first-number-input)
(second-number-input)
(operator-input)
(format t "The result is: ~a" (calculate first-number operator second-number))
