(defun factorial (n)
  "Returns the factorial of a number using recursion"
  (if (equal n 0) ; if n is equal to 0, base case is reached
      1 ; return 1 as the factorial of 0
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; recursively call the function with n-1 and multiply by n
  )
)
 
(print (factorial 5)) ; prints the factorial of 5, which is 120
