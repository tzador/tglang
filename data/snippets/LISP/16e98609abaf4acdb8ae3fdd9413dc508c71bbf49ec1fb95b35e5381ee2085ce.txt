;; This code snippet is a function that checks if a list is sorted in ascending order.
;; It takes in a list as an argument and returns a boolean value.
;; The function uses recursion to compare each element with the next one in the list.

(defun is-sorted (lst)
    (if (or (null lst) (null (rest lst))) ; checks if list is empty or has only one element
        t                                 ; returns true if list is sorted (base case)
        (if (> (first lst) (second lst))  ; compares first two elements
            nil                           ; returns false if first element is greater than second element (not sorted)
            (is-sorted (rest lst)))))     ; recursively calls function with rest of list
