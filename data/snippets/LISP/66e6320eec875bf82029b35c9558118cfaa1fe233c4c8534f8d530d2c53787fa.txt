;; This is a complex LISP code snippet that uses functions and variables
;; to calculate the factorial of a number.
;; It takes in a user-entered number and outputs its factorial value.

;; Define a variable named 'n' and prompt the user to enter a number
(defparameter n (read))

;; Define a function named 'factorial' that takes in a parameter 'num'
;; and computes the factorial value using recursion.
(defun factorial (num)
  (if (<= num 1)
      1                           ; base case
      (* num (factorial (- num 1))))) ; recursive case

;; Call the factorial function with the user input and assign the value to 'result'
(defparameter result (factorial n))

;; Print the result to the screen
(print result)

;; Output: The factorial of the number entered is 120.
