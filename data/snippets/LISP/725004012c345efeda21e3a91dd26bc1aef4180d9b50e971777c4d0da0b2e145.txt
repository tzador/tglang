;This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n) ;define a function named factorial
  (if (zerop n) ;if n is equal to 0
    1 ;return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ;multiply n with the factorial of n-1
  ) ;end if statement
) ;end function
;call the function
(factorial 5) ;output: 120, as 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
