;; This is a function called "factorial" that takes in one parameter, "n"
;; It calculates the factorial of n using a recursive approach.
(defun factorial (n)
  ;; Checks if n is equal to 0, if so, returns 1
  ;; This serves as the base case for the recursive function.
  (if (= n 0)
    1
    ;; If n is not 0, the function is called again recursively,
    ;; passing in n-1 as the parameter.
    ;; The result is then multiplied by n and returned.
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
  )
)

;; Example function call with parameter 5
(factorial 5) ;; Output: 120
