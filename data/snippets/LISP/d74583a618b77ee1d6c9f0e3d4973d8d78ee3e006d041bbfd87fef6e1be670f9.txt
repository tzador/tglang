(defun factorial (n) ; Define a function called 'factorial'
  (if (= n 0) ; If n is equal to 0,
      1 ; return the value of 1.
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; Otherwise, return the multiplication of n and the result of calling the factorial function with n-1 as the argument.
; This recursive function calculates the factorial of a given number by multiplying it with the factorial of the previous number until it reaches 1.
