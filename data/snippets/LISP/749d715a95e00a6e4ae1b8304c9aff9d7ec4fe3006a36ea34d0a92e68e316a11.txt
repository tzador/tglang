;; An example of a recursive function in LISP
;; Calculating the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence

;; Function to calculate the nth term of Fibonacci sequence
(defun fibonacci (n)
  ;; Base case: First and second terms are defined as 1
  (if (or (= n 1) (= n 2))
      1
      ;; Recursive case: nth term is the sum of previous two terms
      ;; Calls the function on the previous two terms and adds them
      (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))
  )
)

;; Test the function with input of 10
(fibonacci 10)
