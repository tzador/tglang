;;; This is a function that computes the factorial of a number.
;;; It uses recursion to repeatedly multiply the number by itself
;;; until it reaches 0, at which point it returns the result.

(defun factorial (n) ; define a function named factorial that takes one argument, n
  (if (<= n 1) ; if n is less than or equal to 1
      1 ; return 1 (base case)
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; recursively multiply n by the factorial of n-1
  )
)

;;; Example usage:
;;; (factorial 5) ; returns 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
