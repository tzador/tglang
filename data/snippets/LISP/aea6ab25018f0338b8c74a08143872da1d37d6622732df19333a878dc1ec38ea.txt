;; This is a code snippet in LISP
;; It creates a function called 'divide' that takes in two parameters, 'a' and 'b'
;; The function will check if 'b' is equal to 0, and if so, it will return an error message
;; If 'b' is not equal to 0, it will divide 'a' by 'b' and return the result
(defun divide (a b)
  "This function divides two numbers"
  (if (= b 0)
      (prin1 "Error - Cannot divide by 0")
      (/ a b))) ;; If 'b' is not 0, use the division operator to perform the division and return the result
