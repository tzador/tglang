; factorial is defined as a function that takes in one parameter, n
; the function is given a name, "factorial" and documentation enclosed in double quotes
; the if statement checks if n is less than or equal to 1, if true, return 1
; if false, multiply n by the result of calling the factorial function again with n-1
; this continues until n becomes 1, at which point the value of 1 is returned, ending the recursion
​
;;; example usage
(factorial 5) ; returns 120 (5*4*3*2*1)
(factorial 0) ; returns 1
(factorial 1) ; returns 1
(factorial -5) ; returns an error
