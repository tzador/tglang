;; This code snippet uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number

(defun factorial (n) ; Define a function called "factorial" that takes in one parameter, n
  (if (= n 0) ; If the given number, n, is equal to 0
      1 ; Return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; Otherwise, multiply n by the factorial of n-1. This uses recursion to call the factorial function again until n equals 0
  )
)

(print (factorial 5)) ; Print the factorial of 5, which should be 120
;; Output: 120
