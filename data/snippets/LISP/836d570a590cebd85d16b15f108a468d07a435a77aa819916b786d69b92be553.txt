(defun factorial (n) ; Creates a function called 'factorial' that takes in one parameter, 'n'
  (if (equal n 1) ; Checks if 'n' is equal to 1
      1 ; If 'n' is equal to 1, return 1 as the base case
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; If 'n' is not equal to 1, recursively calls the 'factorial' function, multiplying 'n' by the result of the function with 'n' decreased by 1
