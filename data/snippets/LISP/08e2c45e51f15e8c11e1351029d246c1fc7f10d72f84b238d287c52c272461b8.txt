;; Define a function called factorial that takes in an argument x
(defun factorial (x)
  ;; Use the built-in function 'if' to check if x is equal to 1
  (if (equal x 1) 1
  ;; If x is not equal to 1, then multiply x with the factorial of (x-1) recursively
    (* x (factorial (- x 1)))))
  
;; Call the factorial function with argument 5 and assign it to the variable 'result'
(setq result (factorial 5))

;; Print the result
(print result)
