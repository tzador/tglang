;; Define a function in LISP that checks if a given number is divisible by 3

(defun divisible-by-3 (num) 
    "Checks if a given number is divisible by 3"
    (cond ((= 0 (% num 3)) ; Checks if the modulus of num divided by 3 equals 0 
        (format t "~d is divisible by 3." num)) ; If true, print a message with the given number
        (t ; If false, print another message
        (format t "~d is not divisible by 3." num))))
