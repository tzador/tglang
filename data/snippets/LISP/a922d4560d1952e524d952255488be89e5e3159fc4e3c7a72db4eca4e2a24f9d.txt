;; This is a complex code snippet in LISP, created by [Your Name]

;; Define a function that takes in two parameters: a list and an integer
(defun find-largest (lst int)
  ;; Initialize a variable to store the largest number
  (let ((largest 0))
    ;; Use a loop to iterate through the list
    (loop for x in lst do
      ;; Check if the current element is larger than the largest number
      (when (> x largest)
        ;; If yes, assign the current element to the largest variable
        (setf largest x)))
    ;; Return the largest number
    largest))

;; Define a list of numbers
(defparameter list-of-numbers '(10 25 3 8 11 16))
;; Call the function and pass in the list and the length of the list
(find-largest list-of-numbers (length list-of-numbers))
