;; The following code snippet creates a function called 'shuffle'
;; that takes in a list as input and shuffles its elements randomly.
(defun shuffle (lst)
    "This function shuffles a given list using a recursive approach"
    (if (null lst) nil
    (append (shuffle (remove (nth (random (length lst)) lst) lst))
    (list (nth (random (length lst)) lst)))))

;; Example usage:
;; (shuffle '(5 2 1 9 4))  ; returns a shuffled list
