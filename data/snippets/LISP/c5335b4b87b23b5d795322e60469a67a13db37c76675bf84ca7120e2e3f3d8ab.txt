(defun factorial (n) ; Defines a function named "factorial" that takes in a parameter 'n'
  (if (zerop n) ; Checks if n is equal to 0
      1 ; If it is equal to 0, returns 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; Otherwise, recursively call the factorial function while subtracting 1 from n and multiplying it with the result
; Output example: (factorial 5) ; Returns 120 as the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
