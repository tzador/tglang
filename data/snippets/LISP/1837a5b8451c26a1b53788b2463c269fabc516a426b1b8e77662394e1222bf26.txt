;;; This is a code snippet in LISP that generates a list of prime numbers within a given range.

;;; Function to check if a number is prime
(defun is-prime (n)
  (cond ((<= n 1) nil) ;;; Any number less than or equal to 1 is not prime
        ((and (= n 2) (= (mod n 2) 0)) t) ;;; Two is the only even prime number
        ((= (mod n 2) 0) nil) ;;; Any even number is not prime
        (t (loop for i from 3 to (truncate (sqrt n)) by 2 ;;; Loop through odd numbers up to square root of n
                 when (= (mod n i) 0) return nil       ;;; If n is divisible by any of the numbers, it's not prime
                 finally return t))))              ;;; If n is not divisible by any number, it's prime

;;; Function to generate a list of prime numbers within a given range
;;; INPUT:
;;; - start: starting number of the range
;;; - end: ending number of the range
;;; OUTPUT:
;;; - list containing all prime numbers within the given range
(defun generate-primes (start end)
  (loop for n from start to end
        when (is-prime n) collect n))

;;; Example: Generate list of prime numbers between 1 and 100
(generate-primes 1 100) ;;; Output: (2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97)
