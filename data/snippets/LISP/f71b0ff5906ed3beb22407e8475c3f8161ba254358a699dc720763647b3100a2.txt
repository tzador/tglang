;; This is a function in LISP that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (= n 0) ; check if n has reached 0
      1        ; base case, return 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; recursive case, multiply n with factorial of n-1 and call function again

(factorial 5) ; calling our function with input 5, should return 120 (5! = 120)
;; Output: 120
