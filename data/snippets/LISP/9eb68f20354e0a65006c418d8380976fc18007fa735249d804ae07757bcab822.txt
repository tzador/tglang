;; Define a macro called "when" that takes in a condition to test and a body of code to execute.
;; Use a gensym to generate a unique variable name for the condition value.
;; Use a backquote to create a template for the macro, filling in "tempvar" and "body".
;; Inside the backquote, use a comma to indicate that "tempvar" should be replaced by its value.
;; Use an "if" statement to check if the condition is true.
;; In the "if" statement, use a comma before "body" to indicate that it should be evaluated as code.
;; Use a "progn" to execute multiple forms in sequence.
;; Use comma-at to indicate that "body" should be expanded into multiple forms.
;; End the backquote to close the template.
