(defun factorial (n) ; Defines a function called factorial that takes in one argument, n
    (if (<= n 1)    ; Checks if n is less than or equal to 1
        1           ; If true, returns 1 
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))   ; If false, multiplies n by the result of calling factorial with n-1 as the argument
    )
)

; Example: Evaluating (factorial 5) will return 120, which is 5*4*3*2*1
; This code implements the factorial function using recursion
; In LISP, indentation and parentheses play a crucial role in defining blocks of code and evaluating expressions
