;;; Function to calculate the factorial of a number
;;; Takes in one parameter, n, and returns the factorial
;;; Function is recursive
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (equal n 1) ;;; Base case: factorial of 1 is just 1
      1 ;;; Return 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ;;; Recursive case: multiply n by the factorial of n-1
  )
