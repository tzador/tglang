(defun reverse-list (lst) ; Defines a function called 'reverse-list' with parameter 'lst'
  (if (null lst) ; Checks if list is empty
      nil ; Returns nil if list is empty
      (append (reverse-list (rest lst)) ; Calls the function recursively on rest of the list and appends the result to
              (list (first lst))))) ; Creates a list with first element of the original list, which is then appended
                                     ; to the result of the recursive call, essentially reversing the list.
