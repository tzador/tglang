;; This code snippet creates a recursive function that computes the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.
(defun fib (n)                          ; Define the function 'fib' with input parameter 'n'
  (if (<= n 1)                          ; Check if n is less than or equal to 1, which are the first two terms of the sequence
      n                                 ; If so, return n
      (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2))))) ; Else, return the sum of the previous two terms in the sequence
