;;; This code snippet is an example of a function in LISP that recursively calculates the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n) ;;; define the function with parameter n
  (if (<= n 1) 1 ;;; if n is less than or equal to 1, return 1 as base case
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ;;; otherwise, multiply n by the factorial of n-1
  )
)
(factorial 5) ;;; call the factorial function with input 5, output: 120
