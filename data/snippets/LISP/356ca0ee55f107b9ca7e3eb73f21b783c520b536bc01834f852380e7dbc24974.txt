;; This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers 
(defun sum-list (list) ; define the function and its input parameter
  (if (null list) ; if the list is empty
      0 ; return 0 as the sum
      (+ (car list) (sum-list (cdr list))) ; otherwise, add the first element of the list to the sum of the rest of the list
    )
  )

;; Example usage
(sum-list '(1 2 3 4)) ; calling the function with a list of numbers, the output should be 10.
