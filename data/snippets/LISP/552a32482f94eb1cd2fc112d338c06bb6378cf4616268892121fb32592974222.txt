;; This is a function that checks if a given number is prime. 
(defun is-prime (num)
  (if (<= num 1) nil ; Base cases: 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
    (loop for i from 2 to (isqrt num)
          do (when (eql (rem num i) 0) (return nil)) ; If the number is divisible by any number, it is not prime
          finally (return t)))) ; If the loop finishes without returning nil, the number is prime
