;; Define a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns 
;; the sum of all the numbers in the list
(defun sum-list (list)
  (if (null list)           ; checks if the list is empty
      0                     ; if so, returns 0 as the sum
      (+ (car list)         ; if not, adds the first element of the list
         (sum-list (cdr list)))))  ; to the sum of the rest of the list
;; Example: (sum-list '(1 2 3)) will return 6
