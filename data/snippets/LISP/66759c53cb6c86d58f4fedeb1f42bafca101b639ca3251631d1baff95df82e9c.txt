;;This code snippet is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
;;It uses recursion to repeatedly call the function until it reaches the base case of 1
(defun factorial (n)
    (if (= n 1) ;;base case: factorial of 1 is 1
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ;;recursive call to calculate factorial
    )
)
(factorial 5) ;;calling the function, output will be 120 as 5! = 120
