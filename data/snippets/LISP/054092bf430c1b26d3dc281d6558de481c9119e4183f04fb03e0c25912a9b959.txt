;; This is a LISP code snippet that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number.
;; It takes in a positive integer as input and returns the factorial value.
;; Using recursion allows for a more concise and elegant solution.

(defun factorial (n)
  "Compute the factorial of a given positive integer using recursion."
  (if (<= n 1) ;; Base case: if n is less than or equal to 1, return 1
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ;; Recursive call: multiply n by the factorial of n-1
  )
)

;; Example call: (factorial 5) returns 120
;; This code snippet showcases the power and simplicity of LISP's syntax for recursive functions.
;; Note: LISP uses prefix notation, where the function is first and then the arguments follow.
