;; Define a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial(n)
  ;; Check if the number is equal to 0, if yes then return 1
  (if (equal n 0)
      1
      ;; Else calculate the factorial recursively by multiplying current number with the factorial of previous number
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
      
;; Define a variable
(defvar num 5)

;; Call the function with the defined variable and print the result
(print (format "Factorial of %d is %d" num (factorial num)))

;; Output: 
;; Factorial of 5 is 120
