;; define a function called 'count-letters' that takes in two parameters: a string and a character
;;;; this function counts the number of times the character appears in the string
;; and returns the count as output
(defun count-letters (string character)
	;; define a local variable 'count' to store the number of occurrences
	(let ((count 0))
		;; loop through each character in the string
		(dotimes (i (length string))
			;; check if the current character is equal to the character parameter
			(if (char= (char string i) character)
				;; if they are equal, increment the count by 1
				(incf count)))
		;; return the final count
		count))
		
;; example usage
(count-letters "hello" #\l) ; returns 2 as there are two "l" characters in the string "hello"
