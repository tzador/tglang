;;; Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number

;;; Main function
(defun factorial (num)
  "Calculates the factorial of a given number"
  (if (<= num 1) ;;; base case - if the number is 1 or less, return 1
      1
      (* num (factorial (- num 1))))) ;;; recursive case - multiply the number by the factorial of (num-1)

;;; Example call
(factorial 5) ;;; Returns 120 - the factorial of 5 is 120
