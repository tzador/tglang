;; Function for finding the factorial of a number

(defun factorial (n)
  (if (equal n 1) ; if n is equal to 1
    1 ; then return 1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))) ; else, multiply n by the factorial of n-1 and return the result

(factorial 5) ; calling the function with n = 5 should return 120, as 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
