;; This code snippet creates a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number
(defun factorial (n) ; define a function called "factorial" that takes in a variable "n"
    (if (<= n 1) ; if n is less than or equal to 1
        1 ; then return 1, the base case of the factorial function
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; else, recursively call the factorial function with n-1 and multiply it by n
    )
)

(factorial 5) ; calling the factorial function with 5 as input, will return the factorial value of 5 (120)
