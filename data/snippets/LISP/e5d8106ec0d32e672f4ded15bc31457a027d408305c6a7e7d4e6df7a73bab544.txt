(defun factorial (n) ; This is a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
  (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
; The code above uses the 'defun' function in LISP to define a function called 'factorial'.
; The function takes in a parameter 'n' and checks if it is equal to zero.
; If it is, it returns 1, otherwise it multiplies 'n' with the result of calling 'factorial' again with the value of 'n-1'.
; This process continues until the base case of n=0 is reached. This ensures the factorial of any number is correctly calculated. 
; Example usage: (factorial 5) ;Output: 120 (5*4*3*2*1)
