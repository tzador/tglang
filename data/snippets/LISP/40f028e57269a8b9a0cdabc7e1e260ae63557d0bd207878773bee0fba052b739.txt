;;; It takes in a single parameter 'x' which is the number to be checked

;; Examples of using the function:
(is-prime 7)   ; returns t, since 7 is a prime number
(is-prime 12)  ; returns nil, since 12 is divisible by 2 and 3 and is not a prime number
(is-prime 1)   ; returns nil, since 1 is not a prime number
(is-prime 100) ; returns nil, since 100 is divisible by 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100 and is not a prime number
