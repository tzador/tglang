;;;; This is a program that calculates the factorial of a number

;;; Define a function to calculate factorial
(defun factorial (num)
  ;;; Start with an accumulator variable set to 1
  (let ((acc 1))
    ;;; Use a loop to multiply acc by each number leading up to num
    (loop for i from 1 to num do
      ;;; Multiply acc by the current number
      (setf acc (* acc i)))
    ;;; Finally, return the factorial result
    acc))

;;; Call the factorial function with input value of 5
(factorial 5) ; Output: 120
