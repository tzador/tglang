;; This code snippet generates a function called "double"
;; that takes in a list of numbers and doubles each number in the list.

(defun double (num-list) ;; Define the function, takes in a list of numbers
  (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (* x 2)) num-list)) ;; Mapcar applies the function to each element in the list

;; Example usage:

(double '(1 2 3)) ;; Returns (2 4 6)
(double '(4 5 6)) ;; Returns (8 10 12)
