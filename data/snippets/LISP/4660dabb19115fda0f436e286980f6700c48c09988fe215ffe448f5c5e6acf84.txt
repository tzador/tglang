;;; A function to calculate the factorial of a number
(defun factorial (n)
  "This function takes in a number `n` and returns the factorial of that number.
  It uses recursion to calculate the factorial.
  Input:
    n: a positive integer
  Output:
    a positive integer, the factorial of n"
  (if (<= n 1) ; checks if n is less than or equal to 1
      1        ; base case, returns 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; recursive call to calculate factorial
;; example usage
(factorial 5) ; returns 120, which is the factorial of 5
