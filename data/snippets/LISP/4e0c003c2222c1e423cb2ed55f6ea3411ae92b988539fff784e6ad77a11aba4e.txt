This code snippet is a function that finds the factorial of a number using recursion.
`(defun factorial (number)` - Function definition, name of function is factorial and takes in one parameter 'number'.
    `(if (= number 0)` - Condition is if 'number' is equal to 0.
        `1` ; base case, if 'number' is 0 then return 1.
        `(* number (factorial (- number 1))))` ; Recursive case, multiply 'number' with the factorial of 'number' - 1 and call function again.
