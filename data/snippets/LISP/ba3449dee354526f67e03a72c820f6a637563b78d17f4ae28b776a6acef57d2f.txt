;; This function calculates the factorial of a given number
;; Parameters:
;; - n: the number whose factorial is to be calculated
;; Returns: the factorial of n
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (= n 0) ; if n is equal to 0
      1        ; return 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; otherwise, multiply n with the factorial of n-1 and return the result

;; Example usage:
(factorial 5) ; this should return 120, which is the factorial of 5
