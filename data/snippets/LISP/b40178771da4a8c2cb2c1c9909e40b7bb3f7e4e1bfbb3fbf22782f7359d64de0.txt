;;; Example of a recursive function in LISP
(defun factorial (n) ;;; This defines a function named 'factorial' that takes in one parameter 'n'
  (if (<= n 1) ;;; This checks if n is less than or equal to 1
      1 ;;; If it is, the function returns 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ;;; If not, it multiplies n by the result of recursively calling the function with n-1 as the argument
