;; This code snippet demonstrates how to define and use a recursive function in LISP.
;; This function calculates the factorial of a given number.
(funcall (defun factorial (n) ;; define a function named 'factorial' with parameter 'n'
    (if (zerop n) ;; check if n is equal to 0
        1 ;; if n is 0, then 1 is returned
        (* n (factorial (1- n))) ;; if n is not 0, then n multiplied by the factorial of n-1 is returned
    )
))
;; To use this function, simply provide any positive integer as the parameter.
;; Example: (factorial 5) will return the factorial of 5, which is 120.
