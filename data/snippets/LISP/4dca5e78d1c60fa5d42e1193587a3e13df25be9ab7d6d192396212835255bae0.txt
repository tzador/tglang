;; This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list

  "This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list."
  (if (null list) ; check if the list is empty
      0 ; if it is, return 0 as the sum
      (if (evenp (car list)) ; if the first element in the list is even
          (+ (car list) (sum-even (cdr list))) ; add it to the sum and continue recursively with the rest of the list
          (sum-even (cdr list))))) ; otherwise, continue recursively with the rest of the list without adding anything to the sum

(sum-even '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)) ; returns 20, which is the sum of all the even numbers in the list (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20)
