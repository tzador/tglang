;; This is a complex LISP code snippet to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit

;; First, we define a function to check if a number is prime or not
(defun is-prime (n)
  "Returns T if N is a prime number, otherwise returns NIL"
  (if (< n 2)
      nil ;; by definition, 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
      (loop for i from 2 to (floor (sqrt n)) do ;; loop from 2 to the square root of N
            (when (= (mod n i) 0) ;; if there is no remainder, N is not prime
              (return-from is-prime nil))) ;; so return NIL
      t)) ;; if we reach this point, N is prime, so return T

;; Next, we define a function to generate a list of prime numbers
(defun prime-list (limit)
  "Returns a list of prime numbers up to the specified LIMIT"
  (let ((primes '())) ;; initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
    (loop for i from 2 to limit do ;; loop from 2 to the limit
          (when (is-prime i) ;; if the current number is prime
            (push i primes))) ;; add it to the list
    primes)) ;; return the list of prime numbers

;; Finally, call the prime-list function with a limit of 20 and print the resulting list
(prime-list 20)
