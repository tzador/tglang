(LAMBDA (X Y) ; This is a function that takes in two arguments, X and Y
   (SETQ Z (+ X Y)) ; This sets a new variable Z equal to the sum of X and Y
    (IF (> Z 10) ; This is an if statement checking if Z is greater than 10
        (PRINT "Z is greater than 10") ; If Z is greater than 10, print a message
        (PRINT "Z is less than or equal to 10")) ; If Z is less than or equal to 10, print a different message
    (CONS Z Y)) ; This returns the cons of Z and Y, creating a new list with Z as the first element and Y as the second
