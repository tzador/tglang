;; This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number n
(defun factorial (n)
  "Calculates the factorial of a given number n."
  (if (equal n 0) ; if n is equal to 0
      1 ; return 1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))) ; else, multiply n by the factorial of n-1
  )
)

;; Example:
(factorial 4) ; returns 24, as 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
