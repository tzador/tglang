;; Define a function "double_factorial" that calculates the double factorial of a given number
(defun double_factorial (n) ;; "defun" is used to define a function in LISP, followed by the function name and its arguments
  (if (or (zerop n) (zerop (mod n 2))) ;; "if" statement to check if the number is 0 or even
      1 ;; if the above condition is true, return 1 as the double factorial of 0 or even numbers is 1
      (* n (double_factorial (1- n))))) ;; if the number is not 0 or even, multiply it by its predecessor with recursion to calculate double factorial
