(defun recursive-factorial (n) ; defines a function named 'recursive-factorial' that takes in one argument, 'n'
    (if (<= n 1) ; if the value of 'n' is less than or equal to 1
        1 ; return 1
        (* n (recursive-factorial (- n 1)))) ; otherwise, multiply 'n' with the result of calling the function recursively with the value of 'n' decreased by 1
)
; this function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion, where the factorial of n is equal to n multiplied by the factorial of n-1
; example usage: (recursive-factorial 5) ; will return 120, as 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
