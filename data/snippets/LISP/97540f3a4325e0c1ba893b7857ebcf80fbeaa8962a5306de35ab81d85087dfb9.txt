(defparameter *list* '(1 2 3 4 5))
      ;This creates a variable called *list* and assigns it a list of numbers 1 through 5.

(defun check-even (number)
  ;This function checks if a number is even or not.
  (if (evenp number) ;evenp is a built-in LISP function that returns true if the number is even.
      t               ;if the number is even, returns true
      nil))           ;if the number is odd, returns false

(defun filter-even (list)
  ;This function filters out even numbers from a given list and returns a new list.
  (let ((new-list '()))          ;creates a new empty list
   (dolist (number list)         ;dolist is a LISP loop over a list

         (setq new-list           ;set the new-list variable by adding the current number
               (cons number new-list))))
     ;cons is a LISP function that adds an element at the beginning of a list
    new-list))                  ;return the new list with all even numbers

(filter-even *list*)            ;call the function with the *list* variable we created earlier
;Output: (2 4)                  ;the result should be a list with only even numbers from the original list
