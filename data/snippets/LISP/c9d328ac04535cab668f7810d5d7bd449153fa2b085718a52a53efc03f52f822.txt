; This code snippet is a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
; It takes in one parameter, and returns the factorial of that number.
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (equal n 0)     ; Recursive base case, factorial of 0 is 1
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))     ; Recursive call to calculate factorial
; Example usage
(factorial 5)     ; Output: 120 (5! = 120)
