;; Defining a function to take in a list and return a new list with elements doubled
(defun double-list (input-list) ;;'defun' is a special operator used for defining functions in LISP
  (if (null input-list) ;; 'if' is a conditional statement
      nil ;; 'nil' is used to indicate empty or null values
      (cons (* 2 (car input-list)) ;; 'cons' is used for creating new lists by adding element to the front
            (double-list (cdr input-list)))) ;; 'cdr' is used for accessing the elements after the first element
;; Example call with input list of (1 2 3)
(double-list '(1 2 3))
;; Output: (2 4 6)
