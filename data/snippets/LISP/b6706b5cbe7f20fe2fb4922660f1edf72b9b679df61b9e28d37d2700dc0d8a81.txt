;;; This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of the squares of those numbers
(defun sum-squares (list) ;;; Define the function with the parameter 'list'
    (if (null list) 0 ;;; If the list is empty, return 0
        (+ (* (car list) (car list)) (sum-squares (cdr list))))) ;;; Otherwise, square the first number in the list and add it to the recursive call of the function with the rest of the list (cdr list)
;;; Example usage:
(sum-squares '(1 2 3 4)) ;;; Output: 30
;;; Explanation: 
;;; This function uses recursion and the built-in functions 'car' and 'cdr' to access elements of the list.
;;; The condition of the 'if' statement checks if the list is empty, if so it returns 0.
;;; Otherwise, it takes the first number in the list (car list), squares it, and adds it to the recursive call of the function with the rest of the list (cdr list).
