; This is a LISP code snippet that implements a recursive factorial function.

(defun factorial (n)          ; Defines a function named factorial, which takes in a parameter n.
  (if (= n 0)                 ; Checks if n is equal to 0.
    1                         ; If so, return 1.
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))  ; Otherwise, recursively call the factorial function on (n - 1) and multiply the result with n.
  )
)

; This is an example call to the factorial function.
; It passes in the value 5 and expects to get 120 in return.

(factorial 5)  ; Output: 120
