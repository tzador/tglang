;; This is a code snippet in LISP that finds the sum of the squares of all even numbers in a given list.

(defun even-square-sum (list)
  "This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of squares of all even numbers"
  (let ((sum 0))
    (dolist (number list sum)
      (when (evenp number)
        (setq sum (+ sum (* number number)))
        ))))

;; Example Usage:
(even-square-sum '(1 2 3 4 5 6)) ; Output: 56
(even-square-sum '(2 4 6 8)) ; Output: 120
(even-square-sum '(1 3 5 7)) ; Output: 0
