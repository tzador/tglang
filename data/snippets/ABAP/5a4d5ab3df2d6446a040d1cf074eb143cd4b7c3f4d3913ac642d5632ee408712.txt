*This program demonstrates a nested loop in ABAP.

*Declaring data variables
data:
  lv_number type i,
  lv_squared type i.

*The outer loop
do lv_number = 1 to 10.

  *The inner loop
  do lv_number = 1 to lv_number.

    *Calculating the squared value of lv_number
    lv_squared = lv_number * lv_number.

    *Printing the result
    write:/ lv_number, 'squared is ', lv_squared.

  *End of inner loop
  enddo.

*End of outer loop, program ends here
enddo.
