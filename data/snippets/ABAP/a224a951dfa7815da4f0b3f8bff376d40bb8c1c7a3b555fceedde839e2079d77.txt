* This is an ABAP program that calculates the area of a circle using user input

REPORT demo_area_of_circle.

* Declaring variables and constants
DATA: radius TYPE f, * holds the radius of circle
      pi TYPE f, * holds the value of pi
      area TYPE f. * holds the calculated area of circle

CONSTANTS: c_radius_label TYPE c VALUE 'Radius of circle: ',
           c_area_label TYPE c VALUE 'Area of circle: '.

* User input for radius
WRITE: / c_radius_label.
READ radius.

* Assigning value to pi
pi = '3.14'.

* Calculating area using formula: A = πr²
area = pi * radius * radius.

* Output
WRITE: / c_area_label, area.
