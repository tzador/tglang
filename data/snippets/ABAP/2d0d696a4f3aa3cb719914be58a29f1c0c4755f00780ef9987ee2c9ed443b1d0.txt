* This program calculates the factorial of a given number
REPORT ZFACTORIAL.

* Data Declaration
DATA: n TYPE i,           " input number
      fact TYPE i VALUE 1.  " factorial result

* Prompt user for input
PARAMETERS p_num TYPE i DEFAULT 5. " default value is 5

* Calculation block
DO p_num TIMES.           " loop from 1 to p_num
  fact = fact * n.        " multiply factorial by current loop number
  n = n + 1.              " increment loop number
ENDDO.

* Output result
WRITE: / 'Factorial of', p_num, 'is', fact.

* Output explanation
WRITE: / 'The factorial of a given number is calculated by multiplying all the numbers from 1 to the given number. In this program, we use a DO loop to iterate from 1 to the given number and continuously multiply the factorial by the current loop number. The result is stored in the variable 'fact' and displayed to the user.'.
