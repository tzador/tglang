"This code snippet shows how to declare and use an internal table in ABAP."
  "First, we declare an internal table with a type and initial size of 10 rows."
  DATA: lt_data TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF scarr INITIAL SIZE 10.
  
  "Next, we populate the internal table with data using the SELECT statement."
  "This example selects all the entries from the 'scarr' table and inserts them into the internal table."
  SELECT * FROM scarr INTO TABLE lt_data.
  
  "We can also use the WHERE clause to only select specific data."
  "In this case, we are only selecting entries where the airline code is 'LH'."
  SELECT * FROM scarr INTO TABLE lt_data WHERE carrid = 'LH'.
  
  "To access the data in the internal table, we can use a LOOP statement."
  "This will loop through each row in the internal table and print out the airline code and company name."
  LOOP AT lt_data INTO DATA(ls_data).
    WRITE: / ls_data-carrid, ls_data-carrname.
  ENDLOOP.
  
  "We can also use the FOR ALL ENTRIES clause to loop through a different internal table."
  "In this example, we are selecting data from the SPFLI table and looping through the lt_data internal table."
  SELECT * FROM spfli INTO TABLE lt_data FOR ALL ENTRIES IN lt_data
    WHERE carrid = lt_data-carrid.
  "Note that the internal tables must have the same structure for this to work."
  
  "Finally, to free up memory, we can use the FREE statement to delete the contents of the internal table."
  FREE lt_data.
