*** Select Data From Database Table ***

* The "SELECT" statement is used to retrieve data from a database table with specified conditions or criteria.

* In this example, we are selecting data from the "ZEMPLOYEE" table where the "DEPARTMENT" field is equal to 'IT' and the "SALARY" field is greater than 5000.

SELECT * FROM ZEMPLOYEE
  WHERE DEPARTMENT = 'IT'
  AND SALARY > 5000.

* The "INTO" clause is used to assign the selected data to a specified internal table.

* In this example, we are assigning the selected data to the internal table "IT_EMPLOYEES".

SELECT * FROM ZEMPLOYEE
  WHERE DEPARTMENT = 'IT'
  AND SALARY > 5000
  INTO TABLE @it_employees.

* The "FOR ALL ENTRIES" clause is used to specify a list of values to be used as selection criteria.

* In this example, we are selecting data from the "ZEMPLOYEE" table for all entries in the internal table "IT_DEPARTMENTS" where the "DEPARTMENT" field in the internal table matches the "DEPARTMENT" field in the database table.

SELECT * FROM ZEMPLOYEE
  FOR ALL ENTRIES IN @it_departments
  WHERE DEPARTMENT = @it_departments-department.

* The "DISTINCT" keyword is used to remove duplicate entries from the selected data.

* In this example, we are selecting distinct values from the "ZEMPLOYEE" table for the "DEPARTMENT" field.

SELECT DISTINCT DEPARTMENT FROM ZEMPLOYEE.

* The "GROUP BY" clause is used to group the selected data based on a specified field.

* In this example, we are selecting the total salary for each department by using the "GROUP BY" clause on the "DEPARTMENT" field.

SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS TOTAL_SALARY
  FROM ZEMPLOYEE
  GROUP BY DEPARTMENT.

* The "HAVING" clause is used to filter the grouped data based on a specific condition.

* In this example, we are selecting the total salary for each department with a minimum salary of 10000 by using the "HAVING" clause.

SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS TOTAL_SALARY
  FROM ZEMPLOYEE
  GROUP BY DEPARTMENT
  HAVING TOTAL_SALARY >= 10000.
