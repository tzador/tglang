REPORT ZEXAMPLE_REPORT.

*This is a sample ABAP report that displays information from two tables. 

*DEFINING INTERNAL TABLES
DATA: lt_students1 TYPE TABLE OF zstudents,
      lt_students2 TYPE TABLE OF zstudents.

*DEFINING WORK AREA
DATA: ls_students1 TYPE zstudents, 
      ls_students2 TYPE zstudents.

*SELECTING DATA FROM FIRST TABLE
SELECT * FROM zstudents INTO TABLE lt_students1.

*SELECTING DATA FROM SECOND TABLE
SELECT * FROM zstudents INTO TABLE lt_students2.

*LOOPING THROUGH FIRST TABLE
LOOP AT lt_students1 INTO ls_students1.

  *LOOPING THROUGH SECOND TABLE
  LOOP AT lt_students2 INTO ls_students2.

    *CHECK FOR MATCHING RECORDS BETWEEN TABLES
    IF ls_students1-student_id = ls_students2-student_id.

      *DISPLAY STUDENT DETAILS
      WRITE: / ls_students1-name, ls_students1-age, ls_students2-grade.

      *LOGIC TO CALCULATE AVERAGE GRADE
      DATA(lv_total_grade) = ls_students1-grade + ls_students2-grade.
      DATA(lv_average_grade) = lv_total_grade / 2.
      WRITE: / 'Average grade:', lv_average_grade.

      *EXIT INNER LOOP
      EXIT.
    ENDIF.
  ENDLOOP.

*DISPLAY TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS
WRITE: / 'Total students:', sy-tabix.

ENDLOOP.
