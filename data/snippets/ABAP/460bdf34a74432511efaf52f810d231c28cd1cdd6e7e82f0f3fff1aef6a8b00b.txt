" The code snippet above selects 10 records from the vbap table and iterates through each record.
" It then selects a record from the likp table based on the vbeln field of the current vbap record.
" If the bstkd field of the selected likp record matches the condition, the netpr field of the current vbap record is divided by 2 and the internal table is updated with the new value.
" This code snippet showcases the use of field symbols, table joins, and conditional statements in ABAP.
