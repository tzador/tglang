REPORT ZREPORT.

* This is a sample report that demonstrates complex coding in ABAP.

* The following data declarations are necessary for the report.
DATA: lv_message TYPE string,
      lv_number TYPE i,
      lv_text TYPE string,
      lv_result TYPE i.

* The following code denotes the start of the executable program.
START-OF-SELECTION.

* First, we populate values into our variables.
lv_message = 'This is a complex code snippet in ABAP'.
lv_number = 10.
lv_text = 'Hello'.

* Next, we perform a series of calculations and store the result in lv_result.
lv_result = lv_number + 5 * 2 / 3.

* We then check if lv_result is greater than 15.
IF lv_result > 15.
  lv_text = 'Result is greater than 15'.
ELSE.
  lv_text = 'Result is less than or equal to 15'.
ENDIF.

* Finally, we display the result and message to the user.
WRITE: / 'Result:', lv_result.
WRITE: / 'Message:', lv_message.

* End of report.
