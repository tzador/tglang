* This is a complex ABAP code snippet that declares and initializes various variables
* and uses different types of loops and control structures

* Declarations
DATA: gv_num1 TYPE i, "numeric variable
      gv_num2 TYPE i,
      gv_result TYPE i,
      gv_string TYPE string, "alphanumeric variable
      gt_numbers TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF i, "internal table

* Initialization
gv_num1 = 10.
gv_num2 = 5.

* Addition
gv_result = gv_num1 + gv_num2.

* Concatenate strings
CONCATENATE 'The result of the addition is ' gv_string INTO gv_string SEPARATED BY space.

* Loop through internal table using DO/ENDDO loop
DO 3 TIMES.
  gv_result = gv_result + 1.
ENDDO.

* Pushing values to an internal table
APPEND 3 TO gt_numbers.
APPEND 5 TO gt_numbers.
APPEND 7 TO gt_numbers.

* Loop through internal table using FOR loop
LOOP AT gt_numbers INTO gv_num.
  gv_result = gv_result + gv_num.
ENDLOOP.

* If statement
IF gv_num1 > gv_num2.
  gv_string = 'Number 1 is greater than number 2'.
ENDIF.

* Comments
*"This is a commented section
" This is another type of comment

* Output the final result
MESSAGE gv_string gv_result.
