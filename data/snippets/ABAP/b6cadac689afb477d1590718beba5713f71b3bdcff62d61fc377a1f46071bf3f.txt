* This is a longer, complex code snippet in ABAP

* Data declarations
DATA: lv_total_price TYPE i,
      lv_discount   TYPE i,
      lv_final_price TYPE i.

* Select statement
SELECT sum( price ) AS total_price
       COUNT( * ) AS count INTO (lv_total_price, lv_product_count)
FROM products
WHERE category = 'electronics'.

* CASE expression
CASE lv_product_count.
  WHEN 0.
    lv_discount = 0.
  WHEN 1 TO 5.
    lv_discount = 5.
    WHEN 6 to 10.
    lv_discount = 10.
  WHEN OTHERS.
    lv_discount = 15.
ENDCASE.

* Arithmetic operations
lv_final_price = lv_total_price - ( lv_total_price * lv_discount / 100 ).

* Output
WRITE: 'Total price for electronics:', lv_total_price,
       'Discount applied:', lv_discount,
       'Final price:', lv_final_price.
