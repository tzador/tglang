REPORT demo_nested_loops.

* This program demonstrates the use of nested loops in ABAP.

DATA: lv_counter1 TYPE i,
      lv_counter2 TYPE i.

* First loop to iterate over values of lv_counter1 from 1 to 5
DO 5 TIMES.

  lv_counter1 = sy-index. "set value of counter to loop index

  * Second loop to iterate over values of lv_counter2 from 1 to 3
  DO 3 TIMES.

    lv_counter2 = sy-index. "set value of counter to loop index

    WRITE: / 'LV_COUNTER1:', lv_counter1, 'LV_COUNTER2:', lv_counter2.
