* This is a long and complex code snippet written in ABAP programming language.
* It creates a report and populates it with data from a database table.
* The report displays the top 10 salespeople based on their total sales amount.

REPORT ZSALES_REPORT.

* Create a selection screen with input fields for year and month.
PARAMETERS: p_year TYPE i,
            p_month TYPE i.

* Create an internal table to store the data from the database table.
DATA: lt_sales TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF zsales,
      ls_sales TYPE zsales.

* Fill the internal table with data from the database table.
SELECT *
FROM zsales
INTO TABLE lt_sales
WHERE year = p_year
  AND month = p_month.

* Sort the data in descending order based on the total sales amount.
SORT lt_sales BY total_sales DESCENDING.

* Loop through the data and display the top 10 salespeople.
LOOP AT lt_sales INTO ls_sales
  ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs_sales>).
  IF sy-tabix > 10.
    EXIT.
  ENDIF.
