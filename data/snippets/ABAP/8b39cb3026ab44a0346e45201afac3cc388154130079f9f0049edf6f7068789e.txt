** ABAP program to display all prime numbers within a given range **

** Data declaration **
DATA: num1 TYPE i, "Starting number
      num2 TYPE i, "Ending number
      count TYPE i, "Variable to store number of prime numbers
      flag TYPE c value 'X'. "Flag to check if a number is prime or not

** User input **
WRITE 'Enter starting number: '.
READ num1.

WRITE 'Enter ending number: '.
READ num2.

** Loop to check for prime numbers **
DO num2 TIMES.

  ** Count variable to store number of prime numbers **
  count = 0.

  ** Check if the current number is prime or not **
  DO num1 TIMES.
    IF num2 MOD num1 = 0.
      ** If the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, increase the counter by 1 **
      count = count + 1.
    ENDIF.
  ENDDO.

  ** If the counter is exactly 2, then the current number is prime **
  IF count = 2.
    WRITE num2.
  ENDIF.

  ** Decrease the current number by 1 for the next iteration **
  num2 = num2 - 1.
ENDDO.

** Verify if any prime numbers were found within the given range **
IF flag = 'X'.
  WRITE 'No prime numbers found within the given range!'.
ENDIF.
