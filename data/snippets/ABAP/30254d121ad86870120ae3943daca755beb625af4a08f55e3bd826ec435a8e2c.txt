* This code snippet shows how to loop through and manipulate a table in ABAP

* Declarations
TABLES: mara. " This declares the table that we will be using

* Selection
SELECT matnr,
       meins,
       bwkey
FROM mara
INTO TABLE @DATA(mara_itab). " This selects the material number, unit of measure, and plant from the mara table and stores it in the internal table mara_itab

* Looping through the table
LOOP AT mara_itab INTO DATA(mara_line).

  * Manipulating data
  CONCATENATE mara_line-matnr ' has unit of measure ' mara_line-meins ' in plant ' mara_line-bwkey INTO DATA(lv_text). " This concatenates the material number, unit of measure, and plant into a text string

  * Changing values in the table
  IF mara_line-meins IS INITIAL. " If the unit of measure is empty, we will change it to the default value 'PCS'
    mara_line-meins = 'PCS'.
  ENDIF.

  * Writing output to the console
  WRITE: / lv_text. " This writes the text string to the console.

ENDLOOP. " End of loop
