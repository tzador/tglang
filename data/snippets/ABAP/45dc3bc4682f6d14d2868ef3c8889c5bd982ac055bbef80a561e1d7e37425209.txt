* This is a long and complex ABAP code snippet
* with multiple conditional statements and loops
* to add, modify, and delete data in a database table 

DATA: lt_data TYPE TABLE OF ztable, " declaring internal table
      ls_entry TYPE ztable, " declaring structure for table entries
      lv_total TYPE i, " variable for calculating total entries

* Select data from database table
SELECT * FROM ztable INTO TABLE lt_data.

* Check if data exists in the table
IF lt_data IS NOT INITIAL.
  " Loop through table entries
  LOOP AT lt_data INTO ls_entry.

    " Add 10 to entry's quantity field
    ls_entry-quantity = ls_entry-quantity + 10.

    " Update table with modified entry
    UPDATE ztable FROM ls_entry.

    " Check if entry's quantity is more than 50
    IF ls_entry-quantity > 50.

      " Delete entry from table
      DELETE ztable WHERE entry_id = ls_entry-entry_id.
    ENDIF.

    " Add entry's quantity to total
    lv_total = lv_total + ls_entry-quantity.
  ENDLOOP.

  " Insert new entry with total quantity
  ls_entry-quantity = lv_total.
  INSERT INTO ztable VALUES ls_entry.
