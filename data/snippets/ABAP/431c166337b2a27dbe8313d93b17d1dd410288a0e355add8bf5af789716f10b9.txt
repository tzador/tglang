* This is a simple program in ABAP to display a list of customers with their orders and total order values.

DATA: t_customers TYPE TABLE OF kna1, " internal table for customers
      t_orders TYPE TABLE OF vbak.  " internal table for orders

* Select all customer details into internal table
SELECT * FROM kna1 INTO TABLE t_customers.

LOOP AT t_customers ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs_cust>).
  CLEAR t_orders.

  * Find all orders for the current customer and add them to internal table
  SELECT * FROM vbak WHERE kunnr = <fs_cust>-kunnr INTO TABLE t_orders.

  * Declare variable for total order value
  DATA(lv_total) = 0.

  LOOP AT t_orders ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs_order>).
    * Add order value to total
    lv_total = lv_total + <fs_order>-netwr.
  ENDLOOP.

  * Display customer name and total order value
  WRITE: / 'Customer:', <fs_cust>-name1, 'Total Order Value:', lv_total.
