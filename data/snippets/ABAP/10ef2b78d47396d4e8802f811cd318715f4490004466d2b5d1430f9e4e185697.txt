*This is a simple ABAP program that asks for two numbers and performs different mathematical operations on them.

*Declaring variables for user input
DATA: number1 TYPE i,
      number2 TYPE i.

*Prompting the user to input two numbers
WRITE 'Enter first number: '.
READ number1.
WRITE 'Enter second number: '.
READ number2.

*Performing addition operation and displaying result
DATA(result_add) = number1 + number2.
WRITE 'Addition of ', number1, ' and ', number2, ' is ', result_add.

*Performing subtraction operation and displaying result
DATA(result_sub) = number1 - number2.
WRITE 'Subtraction of ', number1, ' and ', number2, ' is ', result_sub.

*Performing multiplication operation and displaying result
DATA(result_mult) = number1 * number2.
WRITE 'Multiplication of ', number1, ' and ', number2, ' is ', result_mult.

*Performing division operation and displaying result
DATA(result_div) = number1 / number2.
WRITE 'Division of ', number1, ' and ', number2, ' is ', result_div.

*Performing modulo operation and displaying result
DATA(result_mod) = number1 MOD number2.
WRITE 'Modulo of ', number1, ' and ', number2, ' is ', result_mod.
