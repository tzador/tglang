REPORT ZTEST.

* This report demonstrates the use of ABAP annotations in a complex code snippet.

* Define a structure with fields and annotations
TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_s_user,
         username TYPE string VALUE 'John',
         age TYPE i,
         address TYPE string,
         "@AbapAnnotation1: This annotation will be used to define the data element for the field
         "@AbapDataType: CHAR,
         "@AbapLength: 20,
      END OF ty_s_user.

* Define a table type based on the structure
TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_t_user,
         INCLUDE TYPE TABLE OF ty_s_user,
         "@AbapDeeptype: TYPES ty_s_user,
      END OF ty_t_user.

* Create a new data object based on the table type
DATA: lt_users TYPE ty_t_user.

* Fill the table with data
lt_users = VALUE ty_t_user( ( username = 'Mary' age = 30 address = '123 Main St.' )
                            ( username = 'Bob' age = 45 address = '456 Broadway' )
                            ( username = 'Sarah' age = 28 address = '789 Park Ave.' ) ).

* Loop through the table and print out the data
LOOP AT lt_users ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs_user>).
  WRITE: / <fs_user>-username, <fs_user>-age, <fs_user>-address.
ENDLOOP.
