" This code snippet performs a complex calculation and outputs the result to the user
DATA: CALCULATION TYPE I, " declare a variable of type integer to store the result
      VALUE1 TYPE P DECIMALS 2, " declare a variable of type packed number with 2 decimal places
      VALUE2 TYPE P DECIMALS 2. " declare another variable of type packed number with 2 decimal places

" perform the calculation by adding the two values and storing it in the CALCULATION variable
CALCULATION = VALUE1 + VALUE2.

" check if the result is greater than 100
IF CALCULATION > 100.
  " if it is, then multiply it by 0.5 and store the new result in the CALCULATION variable
  CALCULATION = CALCULATION * 0.5.
ELSE.
  " if it is not, then multiply it by 1.5 and store the new result in the CALCULATION variable
  CALCULATION = CALCULATION * 1.5.
ENDIF.

" output the result to the user
WRITE: 'The final result of the calculation is', CALCULATION.
