''''ABAP Program to find all prime numbers between 2 and 1000

** DATA DECLARATIONS **

DATA: BEGIN OF primes,
          prime_number TYPE i,
          is_prime TYPE i,
      END OF primes,
      number TYPE i,
      count TYPE i,
      check TYPE i.

** PART 1: GENERATE LIST OF PRIME NUMBERS **

* Loop through all numbers between 2 and 1000
DO 999 TIMES.
  number = sy-index + 1.

  * Reset counter for each number
  count = 0.

  * Check if number is a prime number
  DO 999 TIMES.
    check = count + 1.

    * If number is divisible by any number apart from 1 and itself, increment counter
    IF number <> check AND number MOD check = 0.
      count = count + 1.
    ENDIF.
  ENDDO.

  * If counter is still 0, then number is prime
  IF count = 0.

    * Store prime number in internal table
    primes-prime_number = number.

    * Set flag to show that number is prime
    primes-is_prime = 1.

    * Append to table
    APPEND primes.
  ENDIF.
ENDDO.

** PART 2: DISPLAY LIST OF PRIME NUMBERS **

* Sort internal table in ascending order
SORT primes BY prime_number ASCENDING.

* Loop through table and print out prime numbers
LOOP AT primes.

  * If number is prime, print it out with text
  IF primes-is_prime = 1.
    WRITE: 'Prime number found:', primes-prime_number.
  ENDIF.

ENDLOOP.
