	 " The first line checks if variables l_var1 and l_var2 are equal
	 " and variables l_var3 and l_var4 are not equal.
	 " The second line checks if variable l_var5 is greater than or 
	 " equal to l_var6 or the nested condition in parentheses is true.
	 " The nested condition checks if variable l_var7 is less than l_var8 
	 " and l_var9 is greater than l_var10.
	 " The third line checks if l_var11 is between l_var12 and l_var13.
