### Code Explanation

- The first section declares a new data type called "lty_test" which contains key, info1, info2, and info3 fields of different types.
- Then, an internal table "lt_test" is created using the data type, with a default key.
- Next, a selection screen block is created with three parameters - p_key of type i, p_info of type string, and p_char of type c.
- An event is defined for when the user clicks on the input help for p_info parameter.
- The start-of-selection section begins the program, and a select statement retrieves all fields from the lty_test table and stores them in the internal table lt_test.
- If the select statement is successful, the program checks if p_key and p_info have values entered by the user, and if so, it updates the info1 field in the internal table based on the key value.
- If the select statement fails, an error message is displayed.
- Finally, the end-of-selection section ends the program.
