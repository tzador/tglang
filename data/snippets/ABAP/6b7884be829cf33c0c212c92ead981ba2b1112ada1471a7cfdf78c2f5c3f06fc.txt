" This code snippet uses an internal table and loops to calculate the average score
" of students in a class
DATA: lt_scores TYPE TABLE OF i, " Internal table to store scores
      lv_total TYPE i, " Variable to store total score
      lv_avg TYPE f, " Variable to store average score
      lv_count TYPE i. " Variable to store number of students

lt_scores = VALUE #( (score = 90) (score = 80) (score = 95) ). " Populate internal table

lv_count = lines( lt_scores ). " Get number of entries in internal table

" Loop through internal table and sum up all scores
DO lv_count TIMES.
  lv_total = lv_total + lt_scores[ sy-index ]-score.
ENDDO.

" Calculate average score
lv_avg = lv_total / lv_count.

" Output average score
WRITE: / 'Average score is', lv_avg.
