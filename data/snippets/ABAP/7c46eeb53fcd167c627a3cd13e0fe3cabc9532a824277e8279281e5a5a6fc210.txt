*This is a program to generate a random selection of letters
REPORT ZRANDOMLETTERS.

DATA: letter_selection(10) TYPE c OCCURS 10. "Declares a internal table with 10 columns

DATA: alphabet(26) TYPE c OCCURS 26 VALUE 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. "Declares a internal table with 26 columns and fills it with letters of the alphabet

DATA: i TYPE i VALUE 1. "Declares a variable i with initial value 1 to use as a counter

DO 10 TIMES. "Start of a do loop

  DATA: rng TYPE i. "Declares a variable rng to store the generated random number

  CALL FUNCTION 'RANDOM_INT' "Generates a random integer between 1 and 26
    EXPORTING

    IMPORTING
      rnum = rng.
