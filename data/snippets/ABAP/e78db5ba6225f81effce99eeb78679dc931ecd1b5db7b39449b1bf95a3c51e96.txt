REPORT demo_abap_code.

* This is a simple ABAP program that demonstrates a series of calculations and logic operations.
* The program takes in two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them.

PARAMETERS:
    p_num1 TYPE i DEFAULT 5,
    p_num2 TYPE i DEFAULT 3.

DATA:
    lv_sum TYPE i,
    lv_difference TYPE i,
    lv_product TYPE i,
    lv_quotient TYPE f,
    lv_remainder TYPE i.

* Perform addition
lv_sum = p_num1 + p_num2.

WRITE: 'The sum of', p_num1, 'and', p_num2, 'is', lv_sum.

* Perform subtraction
lv_difference = p_num1 - p_num2.

WRITE: 'The difference between', p_num1, 'and', p_num2, 'is', lv_difference.

* Perform multiplication
lv_product = p_num1 * p_num2.

WRITE: 'The product of', p_num1, 'and', p_num2, 'is', lv_product.

* Perform division
IF p_num2 = 0.
    " Handle divide by zero error
    WRITE 'Cannot divide by 0'.
ELSE.
    lv_quotient = p_num1 / p_num2.
    lv_remainder = p_num1 MOD p_num2.

    WRITE: 'The quotient of', p_num1, 'and', p_num2, 'is', lv_quotient,
           'with a remainder of', lv_remainder.
ENDIF.
