REPORT Z_TEST.

* This is a long and complex code snippet in the ABAP programming language.

CONSTANTS: lv_constant TYPE i VALUE 5. "Define a constant with a predefined value.
TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_table,  "Define a structure with multiple fields.
         field1 TYPE i,
         field2 TYPE c LENGTH 5,
         field3 TYPE d,
       END OF ty_table.

DATA: lt_table TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF ty_table, "Define an internal table with the defined structure.
      lv_variable TYPE i VALUE 10. "Define a variable with a predefined value.

* This code snippet demonstrates the usage of control structures and data manipulation.
IF lv_variable < lv_constant. "Check if the variable is less than the constant.
  SELECT * FROM table INTO TABLE lt_table "Retrieve data from a database table and store it in the internal table.
    WHERE field1 = lv_variable.  "Filter the data based on the variable value.
ELSE.
  WRITE: 'Variable is greater than or equal to the constant'. "Print out a message if the condition is not met.
ENDIF.

* This code snippet also demonstrates the usage of loops.
LOOP AT lt_table INTO DATA(ls_table). "Loop through the internal table.
  ls_table-field2 = ls_table-field2 + 'X'. "Add a character to the field2 value.
  MODIFY lt_table FROM ls_table TRANSPORTING field2. "Update the field2 value in the internal table.
  WRITE: / ls_table-field1, ls_table-field2, ls_table-field3. "Print out the values of the fields.
ENDLOOP.

* This code snippet showcases the usage of classes and methods.
