*-- Declaration of variables
DATA: lv_count TYPE i,
      lv_total TYPE i,
      lv_flag TYPE flag,
      lt_table TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF sflight WITH EMPTY KEY.

*-- Selection from database table
SELECT carrid, connid, fldate, planetype, seatsmax
INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE lt_table
FROM sflight
WHERE carrid = 'LH'
AND fldate > sy-datum

*-- Check if the connection ID matches certain criteria

*-- Increment the counter and calculate total seats
