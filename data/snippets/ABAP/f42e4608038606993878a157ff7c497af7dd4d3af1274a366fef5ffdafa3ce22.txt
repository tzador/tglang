* This is a complex code snippet in ABAP *
REPORT Z_DEMO_PROGRAM.

* This program calculates the total sales for each product based on quantity and price *

* Define internal table to store product details *
DATA: lt_products TYPE TABLE OF zproduct,
      ls_product TYPE zproduct.

* Define structure for product details *
TYPES: BEGIN OF zproduct,
         product_id TYPE i,
         product_name TYPE string,
         quantity TYPE i,
         price TYPE p DECIMALS 2,
         total_sales TYPE p DECIMALS 2,
       END OF zproduct.

* Define initial values for internal table *
ls_product-product_id = 1.
ls_product-product_name = 'Product1'.
ls_product-quantity = 10.
ls_product-price = 12.50.

* Add product details to internal table *
APPEND ls_product TO lt_products.

* Repeat for other products *
ls_product-product_id = 2.
ls_product-product_name = 'Product2'.
ls_product-quantity = 5.
ls_product-price = 8.75.

APPEND ls_product TO lt_products.

* Calculate total sales for each product and store in internal table *
LOOP AT lt_products INTO ls_product.
  ls_product-total_sales = ls_product-quantity * ls_product-price.
  MODIFY lt_products FROM ls_product INDEX sy-tabix.
ENDLOOP.

* Display product details and total sales *
