"Simple ABAP program to check for prime numbers

 "Declaration of variables (input and output)
 DATA: num TYPE i,
       flag TYPE c.

 "Let user input a number
 WRITE 'Enter a number: '.
 READ num.

 "Check if input is less than 2 (as 2 is the smallest prime number)
 IF num < 2.

 ELSE.
   "Loop from 2 to (input-1) to check divisibility
   DO num - 1 TIMES.

 "Output result
 WRITE 'The number '.
