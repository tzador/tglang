* Create a table with three fields: ID, Name, and Age

TABLES: ZSTUDENT.

* Create a structure for the fields

DATA: BEGIN OF W_STUDENT,
        ID TYPE I,
        NAME TYPE STRING,
        AGE TYPE I,
      END OF W_STUDENT.

* Create a data object based on the structure

DATA: IT_STUDENT LIKE STANDARD TABLE OF W_STUDENT.

* Populate the data object with some values

IT_STUDENT = VALUE #( (ID = 1 NAME = 'John' AGE = 25)

                      (ID = 3 NAME = 'Mike' AGE = 30) ).

* Loop through the data object and print the values

LOOP AT IT_STUDENT INTO W_STUDENT.

          / 'Name:', W_STUDENT-NAME,
          / 'Age:', W_STUDENT-AGE.
