**" This is a complex code snippet in ABAP language **

" This program allows a user to input a number and calculates its factorial

REPORT Z_CALCULATE_FACTORIAL MESSAGE-ID ABAP_EXAMPLE.

" Define variables
DATA: num TYPE I, " variable to store the input number
      product TYPE I, " variable to store the product of numbers
      count TYPE I. " variable to keep track of the loop count

" Prompt user for input
WRITE 'Enter a number: '.

" Get user input
READ num.

" Initialize variables
product = 1.
count = 1.

" Calculate factorial using a loop
DO num TIMES.
  product = product * count.
  count = count + 1.
ENDDO.

" Display result
WRITE 'The factorial of ' num ' is ' product '.'
