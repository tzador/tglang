DATA: lv_var TYPE i VALUE 1.
DO lv_var TIMES.
  IF lv_var MOD 2 = 0.
    WRITE: 'Hello World'.
  ELSEIF lv_var MOD 3 = 0.
    WRITE: 'Goodbye World'.
  ELSE.
    WRITE: 'Hello Goodbye World'.
  ENDIF.
ENDI.

// Explanation:
This code snippet declares a variable called lv_var of type integer and assigns a value of 1 to it. Then, using the DO loop, the code iterates through the loop the number of times specified by lv_var. The IF statement checks if the value of lv_var is divisible by 2 without a remainder, and if true, prints 'Hello World'. If not, the ELSEIF statement checks if the value is divisible by 3 without a remainder, and if true, prints 'Goodbye World'. If both conditions are false, the ELSE statement prints 'Hello Goodbye World'. This code snippet showcases basic syntax and control flow in ABAP.
