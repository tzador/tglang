SET /A result=%num1%+%num2%
REM Adds the two variables together and stores the result in a new variable

ECHO %num1% + %num2% = %result%
REM Displays the calculation with the result

IF "%result%" GTR "10" (
    ECHO The result is greater than 10.
) ELSE IF "%result%" EQU "10" (
    ECHO The result is equal to 10.
