REM This batch file will check the validity of an email address
REM It will return true if the email address is valid, false if it is not
REM Adapted from https://gist.github.com/trentmillar/999146

REM First, set variables for email address and regular expression
set email=sample@email.com
set regex=^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}$

REM Check the email address against the regex using FINDSTR command
echo %email% | FINDSTR /R "%regex%"

REM If FINDSTR returns an error level of 0, the email address is valid
if %ERRORLEVEL%==0 (
    set valid=true
) else (
    set valid=false
)

REM Output result to user
if %valid%==true (
    echo Email Address is valid!
) else (
    echo Email Address is not valid!
)
