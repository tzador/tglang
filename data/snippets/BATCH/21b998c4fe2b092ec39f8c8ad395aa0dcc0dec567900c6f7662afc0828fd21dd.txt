REM This batch file does a complex calculation and outputs the result

:START
SET /A num1=5
SET /A num2=10
SET /A num3=2
SET /A result=num1*num2/num3

ECHO The result of the calculation is %result%

REM This section repeats the calculation multiple times using a for loop

FOR /L %%i IN (1,1,5) DO (
    SET /A num1=num1*result
    SET /A num2=num2+num3
    SET /A result=num1^2+num2*num3
    ECHO The result of iteration %%i is %result%
)

REM This section checks if the result is divisible by 3

IF %result%==0 (
    ECHO The result is divisible by 3
) ELSE (
    ECHO The result is not divisible by 3
)

REM This section calculates the factorial of the result

SET /A factorial=1

FOR /L %%i IN (1,1,%result%) DO (
    SET /A factorial=factorial*%%i
)

ECHO The factorial of the result is %factorial%

REM This section clears the variables to prevent conflicts with future calculations
