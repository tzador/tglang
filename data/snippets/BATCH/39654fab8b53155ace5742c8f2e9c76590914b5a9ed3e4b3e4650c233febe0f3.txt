REM This is a simple batch program that generates random characters.
REM It will prompt the user for input and then generate a random string with that many characters.
REM It will also display the ascii values for each character in the string.
REM This loop will continue until the user enters "stop" as input.

SET /P input=Enter a number or type "stop" to exit:

IF %input%==stop GOTO END
SET chars=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()

REM This function generates a random character from the chars string.
:CHAR_LOOP
SET /A randIndex=%RANDOM% %% 68
SET char=!chars:~%randIndex%,1!

REM This will display the ascii value of the generated character.
SET /A val=%char%

ECHO Character: %char% - ASCII Value: %val%

REM This adds the generated character to the string.
SET string=%string%%char%

REM This checks if the length of the string is less than the desired length.
REM If so, it will go back to the CHAR_LOOP to generate another random character.
IF NOT %string:~0,%input%%%==%string% GOTO CHAR_LOOP

ECHO Generated String: %string%

REM Restarts the program from the beginning.
GOTO START

REM This is the exit point for the program.
