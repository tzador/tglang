REM This batch file calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user

set /p num=Enter a number:   REM Prompts user to enter a number and stores it in a variable 'num'

set i=1                      REM Initializes the variable 'i' with value 1

REM Loop to calculate the factorial of the number
:loop

    set /a result=result * i REM Multiplies the current value of 'result' variable with 'i' variable
