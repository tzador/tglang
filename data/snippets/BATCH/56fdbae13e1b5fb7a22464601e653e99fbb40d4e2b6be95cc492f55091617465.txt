:: This code snippet creates a directory structure with multiple levels and files in Windows using batch script
:: First, we set variables for the root directory and some example file names
set "ROOT_DIR=C:\Users\John\Desktop\MyFiles"
set "FILE_NAME_1=hello.txt"
set "FILE_NAME_2=world.txt"

:: Next, we create the root directory using the mkdir command
mkdir "%ROOT_DIR%"

:: Then, we create two subdirectories within the root directory using mkdir command
:: These subdirectories will have spaces in their names, so we use the quotes around the directory names
mkdir "%ROOT_DIR%\Level 1"
mkdir "%ROOT_DIR%\Level 2"

:: Next, we create files within the subdirectories using the touch command
:: Since we want different files in each subdirectory, we use different file names
touch "%ROOT_DIR%\Level 1\%FILE_NAME_1%"
touch "%ROOT_DIR%\Level 2\%FILE_NAME_2%"

:: Finally, we use the tree command to verify the directory structure we have created
tree "%ROOT_DIR%"

:: Output:
::.
::└───MyFiles
::    ├───Level 1
::    │   └───hello.txt
::    └───Level 2
::        └───world.txt

:: Cleanup:
:: We can also use the rd (remove directory) command to delete the directory and all its contents
rd /s /q "%ROOT_DIR%"

:: Note: The /s flag in the rd command ensures that the directory and all its contents (subdirectories and files) are deleted. The /q flag ensures that the command operates in quiet mode, without asking for confirmation from the user.
