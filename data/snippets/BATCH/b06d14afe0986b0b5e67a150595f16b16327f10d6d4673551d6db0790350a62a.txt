REM This code snippet will perform a complex calculation using a nested loop
set /a "result=0"  REM initialize result variable to 0
for /l %%i in (1,1,10) do ( REM first loop that runs 10 times
    for /l %%j in (1,1,%%i) do ( REM second loop whose upper limit depends on outer loop's index
        set /a "result=result+%%j" REM add current value of inner loop's index to result variable
    )
)
echo The final result is: %result% REM output the final result
