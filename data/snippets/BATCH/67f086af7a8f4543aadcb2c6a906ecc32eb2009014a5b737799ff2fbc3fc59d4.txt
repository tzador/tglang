set "charSet=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()"

REM Set the initial password length to 10

REM Use the %random% variable to generate a random number, which will be used as the index for selecting characters from the charSet
set /a "index=%random%*%charSet:~0,63%,32768"

REM Use a for loop to generate the password
for /L %%i in (1,1,%pwLength%) do (
    set /a "index=%index%*%%i"
    set /a "index=%index%*%%i"
    set /a "index=%index%/10"
    set /a "index=%index%+%%i"
    set "password=!password!%charSet:~%index%,1!"
)

REM Print the generated password
echo Generated password: %password%

REM Save the generated password to a text file named "password.txt"
echo %password% > password.txt
echo Password saved to file "password.txt"
