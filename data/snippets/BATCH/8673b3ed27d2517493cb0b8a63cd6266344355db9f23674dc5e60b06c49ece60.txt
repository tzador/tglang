SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion
REM This code snippet enables delayed expansion in BATCH, allowing for variables to be expanded at execution time.
REM This is useful for creating dynamic code and avoiding issues with variable expansion.
REM SetLocal is used to limit the scope of the enable delayed expansion, preventing it from affecting other parts of the code.
SET /a "a=5"
REM This line sets the value of variable "a" to 5, using the "/a" command for arithmetic operation.
SET /a "b=10"
REM This line sets the value of variable "b" to 10.
SET /a "c=%a% + %b%"
REM This line sets the value of variable "c" to the sum of variables "a" and "b".
ECHO The value of variable c is %c%.
REM This line prints the value of variable "c".
REM %c% will be expanded to the actual value of c at execution time, thanks to the delayed expansion.
SET i=1
:loop
ECHO %i%
SET /a "i+=1"
REM This loop will print the numbers 1 to 10, incrementing the value of variable "i" by 1 each time.
IF %i% LEQ 10 GOTO loop
REM This line checks if the value of "i" is less than or equal to 10, if true, it will go to the "loop" label and continue the loop.
ENDLOCAL
REM This command ends the local scope and disables the delayed expansion for any code following it.
