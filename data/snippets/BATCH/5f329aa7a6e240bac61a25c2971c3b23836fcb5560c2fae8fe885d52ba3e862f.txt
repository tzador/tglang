@echo off
REM This is a sample batch file
REM It will prompt the user for input and store it in a variable

set /p input=Enter your name: 
REM The 'set' command allows us to create and set variables

echo Hello %input%! 
REM The 'echo' command is used to display text on the screen
REM The variable %input% is used to print the user's input

if "%input%"=="John" (
    REM The 'if' statement checks if the input is equal to "John"
    echo Hello John! 
    REM If the input is "John", it will print "Hello John!"
) else (
    REM If the input is not "John", it will execute the code in this block
    echo You are not John.
)
REM The 'else' statement executes the code if the condition in the 'if' statement is not met

set /a num1=5 
REM This will set the variable num1 to the value of 5
set /a num2=10
REM This will set the variable num2 to the value of 10

set /a sum= %num1% + %num2% 
REM The 'set /a' command evaluates mathematical expressions
REM In this case, it will store the sum of num1 and num2 in the variable 'sum'

echo The sum of %num1% and %num2% is %sum%. 
REM The %num1%, %num2%, and %sum% variables are used to print the values in the statement


REM This batch file can be customized to perform different tasks by changing the variables and adding more commands and statements.
