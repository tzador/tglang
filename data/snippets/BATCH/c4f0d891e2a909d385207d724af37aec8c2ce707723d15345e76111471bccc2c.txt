@echo off  REM turns off command echoing

REM assigns values to variables
set /a num1=5 
set /a num2=10 

REM checks if the first number is greater than the second number
if %num1% gtr %num2% (

    REM if true, prints a message
    echo Number 1 is greater than Number 2

) else (

    REM if false, prints a different message and performs a mathematical operation
    echo Number 1 is not greater than Number 2

    REM assigns the result of the operation to a new variable
    set /a sum=%num1% + %num2% 

    REM prints the sum
    echo The sum is %sum% 
)

REM creates a loop that counts from 1 to 10
for /l %%i in (1,1,10) do (

    REM checks if the current number is even or odd
    set /a remainder=%%i %% 2 

    REM if the remainder is 0, it is even
    if %remainder% equ 0 (

        REM prints the current number and indicates it is even
        echo %%i is even 
    ) else (

        REM prints the current number and indicates it is odd
        echo %%i is odd
    )
)
