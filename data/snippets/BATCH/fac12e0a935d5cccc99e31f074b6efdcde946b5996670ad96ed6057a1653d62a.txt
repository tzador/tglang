:: Loop through a list of numbers and perform calculations
@echo off

:: Set list of numbers to be used in the loop
set "numbers=1, 2, 3, 4, 5"

:: Create a loop to iterate through the list of numbers
for %%i in (%numbers%) do (

    :: Perform calculation on current number
    set /a result=%%i * 2

    :: Print the result to the console
    echo Result of calculation for number %%i is: %result%
)

:: Output:
:: Result of calculation for number 1 is: 2
:: Result of calculation for number 2 is: 4
:: Result of calculation for number 3 is: 6
:: Result of calculation for number 4 is: 8
:: Result of calculation for number 5 is: 10
