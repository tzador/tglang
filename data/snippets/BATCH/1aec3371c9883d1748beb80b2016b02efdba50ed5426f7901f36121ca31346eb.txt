:: This is a sample batch code snippet
@echo off
rem This command turns off the command echo
set "value=123"
rem This sets the value variable to 123
:loop
if %value% GTR 100 (
    echo Value is greater than 100
    set /a value=%value%/2
    rem This divides the value by 2
    goto loop
) else (
    echo Value is less than 100
    set /a value=%value%*2
    rem This multiplies the value by 2
)
rem This is a loop that checks if the value is greater than 100 and divides it by 2 if it is, otherwise it multiplies it by 2
echo Final value is %value%
rem This line displays the final value of the variable
pause
rem This command pauses the code execution until the user presses a key
