rem This code snippet creates a loop that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10

set sum=0          rem initialize the sum variable to 0
set count=1        rem initialize the count variable to 1

:loop              rem create a label for the loop
set /a sum+=count  rem add the count value to the sum
set /a count+=1    rem increment the count by 1

if %count% leq 10 ( rem check if the count is less than or equal to 10
    goto loop      rem if condition is true, loop back to the label
) else (
    goto end       rem if condition is false, go to the end label
)

:end               rem create a label for the end of the loop
echo The sum is %sum% rem print out the final sum
pause              rem pause the execution to view the result
