:: This is a BATCH code snippet that generates a random password containing letters and digits
@ECHO OFF
:: The ECHO command is used to turn off the display of command prompt commands

SET count=0
:: SET command is used to assign a value to a variable

:GENERATE
:: This label is used to jump back to the loop if the generated password doesn't meet the criteria

SET password=
:: The password variable is used to store the generated password

:LENGTH_CHECK
IF %count% EQU 10 GOTO PASSWORD_READY
:: This IF statement checks if the length of the password is equal to 10, if yes, it jumps to the label PASSWORD_READY

SET /a num=%RANDOM%*10/32768+1
:: The %RANDOM% function generates a random number, which is then used to select a random character from the string

SET string=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
:: This string contains all the possible letters that can be included in the password

FOR /L %%G IN (1,1,%num%) DO CALL SET character=%%character%%!string:~%RANDOM%%,1!
:: This FOR loop runs a certain number of times based on the value of the variable num, and each time it selects a random character from the string and appends it to the variable character

SET /a num=%RANDOM%*10/32768+1
:: This statement is similar to the one above and generates a random number to be used for selecting a character from a different string

SET string=0123456789
:: This string contains all the possible digits that can be included in the password

FOR /L %%G IN (1,1,%num%) DO CALL SET character=%%character%%!string:~%RANDOM%%,1!
:: This FOR loop is also similar to the one above, but it appends digits to the variable character instead

SET /a count+=1
:: This statement increments the count variable by 1, indicating that a character has been added to the password

GOTO GENERATE
:: This statement jumps back to the label GENERATE to check if the generated password meets the criteria

:PASSWORD_READY
ECHO Your random password is: %password%
:: This ECHO statement displays the generated password to the user

PAUSE
:: The PAUSE command is used to stop the program and prompt the user to press any key to continue

EXIT /B
:: The EXIT command is used to end the batch program
