:: This is a batch code snippet that checks for the presence of a specific file in a directory and copies it to another location if it exists
:: The code starts by setting the current directory to the one where the file is expected to be present
cd "C:\Users\Documents\Folder"

if exist "file.txt" (

:: If the file exists, the code continues to the next step
echo File exists!

:: Checking if the destination directory exists
if not exist "C:\Users\Documents\New Folder" (

:: If the destination directory does not exist, the code creates it
