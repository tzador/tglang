REM This snippet creates a for loop that iterates through a list of numbers, squares each number, and outputs the result
set i=1
for %%a in (1, 5, 9, 12, 16, 20) do (
    set /A squared=%%a * %%a
    echo The square of %%a is !squared!
)
REM Explanation: This code sets the variable i to 1 and creates a for loop that iterates through a list of numbers 1, 5, 9, 12, 16, and 20. Within the loop, the value of squared is calculated by multiplying the current number by itself using the set /A command. The result is then output using the echo command and the !squared! variable is used to access the calculated value. The output would be:
The square of 1 is 1
The square of 5 is 25
The square of 9 is 81
The square of 12 is 144
The square of 16 is 256
The square of 20 is 400
