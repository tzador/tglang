REM This is a batch file that generates a random number and prints it to the console
@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion

REM Generate a random number using the current timestamp as the seed
set /a "randomNum=%time:~6,2% + (%time:~9,2%*100) + (%time:~1,1%*10000) + (%time:~4,1%*1000000)"

REM Print the random number to the console
echo Random Number: %randomNum%

REM Save the random number to a text file
set "outfile=random_number.txt"
echo %randomNum% > %outfile%

REM Enclose text file name in quotes if it contains spaces
set "quoted_outfile=%outfile:"=%"

REM Check if the text file was successfully created
if exist "%quoted_outfile%" (
    echo Random number successfully saved to %quoted_outfile%
) else (
    echo Failed to save random number to %quoted_outfile%
)

REM Pause the batch file so the console doesn't immediately close
pause
