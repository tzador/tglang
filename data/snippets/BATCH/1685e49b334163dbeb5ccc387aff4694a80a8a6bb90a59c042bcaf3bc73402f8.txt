@echo off
:: disables displaying commands in the console

set fileName=currentDateTime.txt 
:: creates a variable to store the name of the text file

set currentDate=%DATE:~10,4%%DATE:~7,2%%DATE:~4,2% 
:: extracts current date in format YYYYMMDD from the DATE variable, which would normally look like 'Day MM/DD/YYYY'

set currentTime=%TIME:~0,2%%TIME:~3,2%%TIME:~6,2% 
:: extracts current time in format HHMMSS from the TIME variable, which would normally look like 'HH:MM:SS.ss'

echo Date: %currentDate% >> %fileName% 
:: appends current date to the text file, denoted by >> as it already exists, so it doesn't overwrite existing data

echo Time: %currentTime% >> %fileName% 
:: appends current time to the text file

echo The current date and time have been saved to %fileName% 
:: notifies the user that the operation was successful
