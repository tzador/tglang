REM Initialize variables
SET /A num1 = 10
SET /A num2 = 5

REM Add numbers and store result in variable
SET /A sum = %num1% + %num2%

REM Subtract numbers and store result in variable
SET /A difference = %num1% - %num2%

REM Multiply numbers and store result in variable
SET /A product = %num1% * %num2%

REM Divide numbers and store result in variable
SET /A quotient = %num1% / %num2%

REM Display results
ECHO The sum of %num1% and %num2% is %sum%
ECHO The difference of %num1% and %num2% is %difference%
ECHO The product of %num1% and %num2% is %product%
ECHO The quotient of %num1% and %num2% is %quotient%
