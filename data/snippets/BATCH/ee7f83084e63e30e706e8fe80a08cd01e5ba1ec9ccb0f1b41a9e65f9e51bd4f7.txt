REM --- This is a batch file that performs a series of operations ---

REM --- Create a variable to store the current date and time ---
set datetime=%date:~-4%-%date:~3,2%-%date:~0,2%_%time:~0,2%-%time:~3,2%-%time:~6,5%

REM --- Create a directory with the current date and time as its name ---
mkdir %datetime%

REM --- Copy a file from one location to the newly created directory ---
xcopy C:\Users\User1\Documents\file.txt %datetime% /E /C /H /R /Y

REM --- Navigate to the newly created directory ---
cd %datetime%

REM --- Rename the copied file to a more complex name with the current date and time ---
ren file.txt "file_%datetime%.txt"

REM --- Delete all text files in the current directory ---
del *.txt

REM --- Create a loop that creates 10 empty text files ---
for /L %%i in (1,1,10) do (
  echo.>"file%%i.txt"
)

REM --- Create a variable to store the total number of files in the current directory ---
set count=0

REM --- Loop through all files in the current directory and increment the count variable ---
for /f "usebackq delims=" %%f in (`dir /b /a-d`) do (
  set /a count+=1
)

REM --- Print the result of the count variable ---
echo The total number of files in the directory is %count%
