REM This is a batch script that runs a series of commands
REM It starts by setting the current directory to the parent directory

cd..

REM This command creates a new folder called "output"

mkdir output

REM Next, it copies all files in the current directory and all subdirectories
REM with the .txt extension to the newly created "output" folder

xcopy *.txt output /s /c /d

REM After that, it changes the current directory to the "output" folder

cd output

REM This command creates a new text file that lists all the names of the files
REM in the current directory and all subdirectories

dir /b /s > file_list.txt

REM Next, it iterates through the list of file names in the "file_list.txt" file
REM and for each file, it checks if it contains the word "error"

for /f "tokens=* delims==" %%a in (file_list.txt) do (
    findstr /c:"error" "%%a" > nul
    if %errorlevel% equ 0 (
        REM If the file contains the word "error", it appends the file name
        REM to the "error_log.txt" file in the parent directory

        echo %%a >> "..\error_log.txt"
    )
)

REM Finally, it deletes the "file_list.txt" file and displays a message
REM indicating that the process is complete

del file_list.txt
echo "Batch script completed successfully!"
