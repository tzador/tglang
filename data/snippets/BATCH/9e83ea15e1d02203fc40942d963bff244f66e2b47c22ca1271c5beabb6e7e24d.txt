REM Set a variable with a string value
set input=Hello World

REM Set another variable with an integer value
set num=10

REM For loop that prints the string value 5 times
for /l %%a in (1,1,5) do (
    echo %input%
)

REM If statement that checks the integer value
if %num% EQU 10 (
    echo "The integer value is 10"
) else (
    echo "The integer value is not 10"
)

REM While loop that will keep counting until the integer value is reached
set i=1
:loop
if %i% LSS %num% (
    echo %i%
    set /a i+=1
    goto loop
)

REM Goto statement that jumps to a specific label in the code
goto end

REM Label that is being jumped to by the goto statement
:end
echo "End of the code snippet"
