REM This batch program checks for available disk space on the C:\
REM drive and displays a message if it is below a certain threshold

SET "threshold=50" // Sets the threshold to 50 megabytes
FOR /F "skip=1 tokens=1,2 delims=: " %%A IN ('FSUTIL VOLUME DISKFREE C:\') DO (
  SET current_drive=%%A:
  SET current_free=%%B
)
REM Loop through the output of the "FSUTIL VOLUME DISKFREE C:\" command to get the current C: drive and free space
REM The "skip=1" skips the first line of the output (which contains the total free space)
REM The "tokens=1,2" splits the output into two parts (the drive and the free space)
REM The "delims=: " sets the colon and space as delimiters

SET /A current_free_mb=%current_free:~0,-6% // Strip the last six characters (which are "bytes") from the current free space
IF %current_free_mb% LSS %threshold% (
  ECHO Low disk space on %current_drive%
  PAUSE
)
REM If the current free space is less than the threshold, display a message and pause the program
