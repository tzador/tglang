REM This is a long and complex code snippet
REM It uses multiple loops and conditional statements 
for /l %%i in (1, 1, 10) do (
    REM The for loop iterates from 1 to 10
    if %%i==5 (
        REM This if statement checks if the current iteration is equal to 5
        echo "The current iteration is 5"
    ) else (
        REM If the current iteration is not equal to 5, it executes the following code
        for /l %%j in (1, 1, 5) do (
            REM This for loop iterates from 1 to 5
            echo %%i %%j
            REM It prints the values of the variables for each iteration
        )
    )
)

REM This is a labeled loop
set /p input="Enter a number: "
REM Prompts the user to enter a number
if "%input%"=="exit" (
