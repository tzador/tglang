REM This batch file calculates the factorial of a given number.

REM Set /a command executes the mathematical expression
REM inside the parentheses and assigns the result to the
REM variable "factorial".
REM %1 refers to the first argument passed to the batch file.
REM In this case, it will be the number for which the factorial
REM needs to be calculated.
set factorial=1
set /a num=%1
echo Calculating factorial of %1...

REM This for loop iterates from 1 to the given number,
REM multiplying the current factorial by the loop index
REM to get the final result.
REM The echo command prints each calculation step.
for /l %%i in (1, 1, %num%) do (
    set /a factorial=factorial*%%i
    echo %%%i! = %factorial%
)

REM Prints the final result.
echo The factorial of %1 is %factorial%.
