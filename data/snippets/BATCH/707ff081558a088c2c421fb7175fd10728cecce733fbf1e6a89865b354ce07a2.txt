:: This code snippet demonstrates how to use delayed expansion in batch programming

:: Set a counter variable
set counter=0

:: Loop through a set of numbers
for /l %%i in (1,1,10) do (
    :: Increment the counter by 1
    set /a counter+=1
    :: Print the counter value with delayed expansion
    echo The value of counter with delayed expansion: !counter!

    :: Do some calculations with the counter value
    set /a result=!counter!*2
    :: Print the result value with delayed expansion
    echo The result of the calculation with delayed expansion: !result!
)

ECHO.
:: Print the final value of the counter
echo The final value of counter: %counter%
ECHO.

:: Use delayed expansion within an IF statement
if "!counter!" == "10" (
    echo The counter value is equal to 10
)

:: Disable delayed expansion
