:: This batch file will add numbers and create a new text file with the resulting sum
set /p x=Enter first number: 
set /p y=Enter second number: 
set /a z=%x% + %y%
echo %x% + %y% = %z% > result.txt
:: if you want to use decimals, remove the /a switch and use 'set /a z=(x + y)' instead
:: this will add the two numbers together and store the result in the variable z, which will then be displayed and saved in the result.txt file
