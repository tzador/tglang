REM This batch file will recursively loop through all files in a given directory and output the total number of lines of code within each file.

REM Set the directory path to the folder containing the files
set "dir_path=C:\Users\Code\Folder"

REM Initialize the total number of lines variable
set "total_lines=0"

REM Use the for loop to iterate through all files in the directory
for /r "%dir_path%" %%i in (*) do (

    REM Use findstr command to count the number of lines in the file
    set /a "lines_in_file=0"
    for /f %%a in ('findstr /R /N "^" "%%i" ^| find /C ":"') do set /a "lines_in_file=%%a"

    REM Add the number of lines in the file to the total number of lines variable
    set /a "total_lines=%total_lines% + %lines_in_file%"

    REM Print the file name and the number of lines in the file
    echo %%i - %lines_in_file%

REM Print the total number of lines for all files in the directory
echo Total lines: %total_lines%
