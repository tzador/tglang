REM This code snippet demonstrates the use of variables, arrays, and loops in BATCH.

REM declare an array of 5 numbers
set arr[0]=3
set arr[1]=5
set arr[2]=1
set arr[3]=7
set arr[4]=2

REM loop through the array and print each element
for /L %%i in (0, 1, 4) do (
    echo The element at index %%i is !arr[%%i]!
)

REM declare two variables and perform arithmetic operations
set /a var1=4
set /a var2=2
set /a result=%var1%*%var2%

REM print the result
echo The result of %var1%*%var2% is %result%

REM use conditional statements to check if the result is greater than 10
if %result% GTR 10 (
    echo The result is greater than 10.
) else (
    echo The result is not greater than 10.
)
