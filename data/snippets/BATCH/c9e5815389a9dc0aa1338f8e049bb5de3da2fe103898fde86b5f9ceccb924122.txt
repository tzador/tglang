:: This code snippet takes input from the user, multiplies it by all numbers leading up to it, and outputs the result. It uses the GOTO statement to create a loop and the SET statement to manipulate variables. The result variable is initially set to 1 and is multiplied by the user input until the input reaches 1. The result is then printed out using the ECHO statement.
