SET /p name="Enter your name: " 

REM This command sets a variable called 'name' to the user's input

ECHO Hello, %name%! 

REM This command prints a greeting message using the variable 'name'

SET /a num1=10
SET /a num2=15

REM These commands set two variables 'num1' and 'num2' to integer values

SET /p operation="Enter the operation (+ or -): "

REM This command prompts the user to enter an operation

IF %operation% == + (
    SET /a result=%num1% + %num2%
) ELSE IF %operation% == - (
    SET /a result=%num1% - %num2%
) ELSE (
    SET /a result=0
)

REM This conditional statement checks the value of 'operation' and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation, storing the result in a new variable 'result'. If the user does not enter a valid operation, the result is set to 0.

ECHO The result of %num1% %operation% %num2% is %result%.

REM This command prints the arithmetic expression and the calculated result using the previously set variables.

PAUSE

REM This command pauses the execution of the batch file, allowing the user to see the result message before the window closes.
