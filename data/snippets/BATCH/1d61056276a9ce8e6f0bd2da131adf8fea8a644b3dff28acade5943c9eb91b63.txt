::This code snippet checks if a folder named "folder" exists on the desktop and creates it if it doesn't exist.
::It then loops through the check and creation process until the folder is created.
::If the folder already exists, it will inform the user and end the loop.
::The loop is labelled as "loop" and the end of the loop is labelled as "end".
::To prevent infinite looping, a "goto" command is used to jump back to the "loop" label at the end of the loop.
::A double colon is used to write comments in the code.
::The loop can be terminated by pressing "ctrl + c" on the keyboard.
