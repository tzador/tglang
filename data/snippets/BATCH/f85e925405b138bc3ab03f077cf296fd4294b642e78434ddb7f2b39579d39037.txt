:: SET keyword is used to assign a value to a variable
:: In this code, a for loop is being used to iterate from 1 to 10
:: The value of count variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the foo subroutine is called
:: The value of count is echoed in each iteration, using the ! notation to enable the use of delayed expansion
:: The foo subroutine takes in an argument, which will be the current iteration number (%%i)
:: The code for the foo subroutine is included below
:: The call keyword is used to call the subroutine
:: The goto EOF statement at the end will continue the program execution at the end of the file, effectively skipping the code below this point
:: This is a common convention to avoid executing the subroutine code again unintentionally
:: This is the end of the for loop
echo End of for loop
