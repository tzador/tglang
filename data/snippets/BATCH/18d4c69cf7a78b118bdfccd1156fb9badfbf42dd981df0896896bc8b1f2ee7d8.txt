REM This batch file will create a new file and write some data into it

REM First, we set the name of the new file
set FILE_NAME="new_file.txt"

REM Then, we initialize a variable to hold the data we want to write
set DATA="This is a new file with some data written in it."

REM We use the `echo` command to output the data to the file
echo %DATA% > %FILE_NAME%

REM We can also append more data to the file using the `>>` operator
echo "This is another line of data." >> %FILE_NAME%

REM We can view the contents of the file using the `type` command
type %FILE_NAME%

REM To pause the execution of the batch file, we can use the `pause` command
pause

REM We can also delete the file using the `del` command
del %FILE_NAME%

REM To check if the file has been deleted, we can use the `if exist` statement
if exist %FILE_NAME% (
    echo "The file still exists, deletion failed."
) else (
    echo "The file has been successfully deleted."
)
