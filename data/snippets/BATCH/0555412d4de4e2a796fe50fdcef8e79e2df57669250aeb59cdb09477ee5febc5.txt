@echo off  REM this turns off command echoing
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion  REM allows expansion of variables within loop
set "userInput=example string"  REM this is the input string

REM this loops through each character in the string and echoes it to the console
for /L %%i in (0,1,21) do (
  set "char=!userInput:~%%i,1!"
  echo !char!
)

REM this checks if the input string contains the letter 'e' and echoes a message accordingly
if "!userInput:~-1!" equ "e" (
  echo The string ends with 'e'.
) else (
  echo The string does not end with 'e'.
)

REM this replaces all occurrences of the letter 'a' with 'x' and echoes the modified string
set "modifiedString=!userInput:a=x!"
echo The modified string is: !modifiedString!

REM this creates a directory using the input string as the name
md "!userInput!"  REM the exclamation marks ensure proper expansion of variable
REM if the directory is successfully created, a message is echoed to the console
if %errorlevel% equ 0 (
  echo Directory created successfully.
)

REM this changes the directory to the newly created one
cd "!userInput!"
REM if the directory change is successful, a message is echoed to the console
if %errorlevel% equ 0 (
  echo Directory changed successfully.
)

REM this creates a new file within the directory and echoes a message to the console if successful
copy con "!userInput!".txt  REM "con" represents console output
if %errorlevel% equ 0 (
  echo File created successfully.
)

REM this adds a line of text to the file and closes it
echo This is a new line of text. >> "!userInput!".txt

REM this opens the file for viewing
start notepad.exe "!userInput!".txt
