set counter=0 :Sets the variable 'counter' to 0
set max_num=10 :Sets the maximum number of iterations

: While loop to iterate 10 times
: Uses the 'leq' comparison operator to check if counter is less than or equal to max_num
: If true, run the code block inside the loop
: Increment the counter by 1 on each iteration
: Continue looping until counter is greater than max_num

: Code block inside the loop
: Uses the 'if' conditional statement to check if counter is even
: If true, print "Even number" to console
: If false, print "Odd number" to console

: This is the end of the loop, program continues executing after the 'goto' statement
: without the 'goto' statement, the program will continue looping indefinitely

: Goto statement to return to the beginning of the loop

: End of program, nothing else will be executed
