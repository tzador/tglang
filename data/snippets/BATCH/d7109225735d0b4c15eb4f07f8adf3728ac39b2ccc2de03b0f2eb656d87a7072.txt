REM This is a simple code snippet in BATCH that creates a directory, 
REM copies a file, and sets the directory as the current working directory
 
REM Creating a new directory called "NewFolder"
mkdir NewFolder

REM Copying a text file called "Example.txt" into the newly created directory
copy Example.txt NewFolder/

REM Setting the newly created directory as the current working directory
cd NewFolder/

REM Checking the current directory using the 'dir' command
dir

REM Output:
  NewFolder/
     0 File(s)     0 bytes

The 'dir' command will show that the "NewFolder" directory is empty because we have not added any files to it yet.
