' Here we will define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

' Define the factorial function with a parameter for the number to calculate
Function Factorial(number)

    ' Initialize a variable to hold the factorial result
    Dim result

    ' Set the initial result to 1
    result = 1

    ' Loop through each number from 1 to the given number
    For i = 1 To number

        ' Multiply the current result by the current number
        result = result * i
    Next

    ' Return the final result
    Factorial = result

End Function

' Now we will use the factorial function to calculate the factorial of 5
' We can use the Response.Write method to output the result to the page
Response.Write("Factorial of 5 is: " & Factorial(5))

' Output:
' Factorial of 5 is: 120
