<!--- This code snippet uses ASP (Active Server Pages), a popular server-side scripting language for creating dynamic web pages.

<% Response.Write "Hello, World!" %> <!--- This line uses the Response object in ASP to output the string "Hello, World!" on the webpage. -->

<% Dim num1, num2, result 'Creating variables in ASP. %>
<!---num1 and num2 will be used for arithmetic operations while result will hold the final result. -->

<% num1 = 10 'Assigning value 10 to num1. %>
<% num2 = 5 'Assigning value 5 to num2. %>
<% result = num1 + num2 'Performing addition operation and storing the result in the variable result. %>

<% Response.Write "The result of " & num1 & " + " & num2 & " is " & result %> <!--- This line will output the result of the addition operation in the format "The result of 10 + 5 is 15" on the webpage. -->

<!--- Some other available ASP objects that can be used include Request, Server, Session, and Application, which allow access to incoming request information, server variables, session variables, and application variables respectively. -->

<!--- ASP also allows the use of conditional statements and loops, similar to other programming languages. For example: -->

<% If num1 > num2 Then 'Checking if num1 is greater than num2. %>
    <% Response.Write num1 & " is greater than " & num2 %> <!--- Output if the condition is true. -->
<% Else %>
    <% Response.Write num2 & " is greater than " & num1 %> <!--- Output if the condition is false. -->
<% End If %>

<!--- This code snippet showcases some of the basic features of ASP and how it can be used to create dynamic content on webpages. -->
