<!--This code snippet demonstrates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion
function factorial(num) {
    'create a base case for recursion'
    if (num == 0) {
        return 1 'return 1 for the factorial of 0'
    } else {
        return num * factorial(num-1) 'recursively call the function, passing the value of num-1 as the argument'
    }
}
'call the function and store the result in a variable'
Dim result
result = factorial(5)

'result should now contain the factorial of 5, which is 120, and can be outputted in a HTML page'
Response.Write "The factorial of 5 is " & result
'output: The factorial of 5 is 120'
