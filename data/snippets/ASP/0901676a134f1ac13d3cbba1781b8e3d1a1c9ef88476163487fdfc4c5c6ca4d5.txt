' This code snippet demonstrates a for loop in ASP

' Declaring a variable to store the maximum number of iterations
dim max
max = 10

' Starting the for loop
for i=1 to max

' Declaring a variable to store the current iteration number
dim current
current = i

' Printing the current iteration number
Response.Write("Current iteration: " & current)

' Checking if the current iteration is an odd number
if current mod 2 <> 0 then

' Printing a message if it is an odd number
Response.Write(", which is an odd number.")

end if

' Ending the for loop
