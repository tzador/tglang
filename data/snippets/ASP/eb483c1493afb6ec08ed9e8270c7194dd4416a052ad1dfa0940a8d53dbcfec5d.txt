' This code snippet is an example of an ASP program that collects user input,
' performs calculations, and displays the results on a webpage. 

' Begin by declaring and initializing variables to store user input
Dim num1, num2, sum

' Use the Request object to retrieve user input from a form on the webpage
num1 = Request.Form("number1")
num2 = Request.Form("number2")

' Perform a simple calculation by adding the two numbers together
sum = num1 + num2

' Output the result on the webpage using the Response object
Response.Write("<p>The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & sum & ".</p>")


' This code snippet also includes an If/Else statement to handle potential errors or invalid input.

' Check if the user input can be converted to a number
If IsNumeric(num1) And IsNumeric(num2) Then

    ' If so, perform the calculation and display the result
    sum = num1 + num2
    Response.Write("<p>The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & sum & ".</p>")

Else

    ' If not, display an error message on the webpage
    Response.Write("<p>Invalid input. Please enter numerical values.</p>")

End If
