<!-- This is a complex code snippet in ASP to calculate the average grade of a student based on their subject grades. -->

<% Option Explicit ' Ensures all variables are declared before use %>

<% ' Create an array of subject grades %>
Dim grades(5)

grades(0) = 95
grades(1) = 80
grades(2) = 75

<% ' Calculate the sum of the grades %>
Dim sum

Next

<% ' Calculate the average grade %>
Dim total, average
