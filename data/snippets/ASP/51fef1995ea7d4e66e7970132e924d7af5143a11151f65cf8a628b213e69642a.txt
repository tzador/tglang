<!-- 
This code declares three variables, num1, num2, total, and assigns values to num1 and num2.
It then uses the plus sign to add the values of num1 and num2 and stores the result in total. 
The output of this code would be 7. 
-->
<h1>The total is <%= total %>.</h1>
<!-- 
This code uses the <%= %> notation to output the value of the variable total in the HTML page.
