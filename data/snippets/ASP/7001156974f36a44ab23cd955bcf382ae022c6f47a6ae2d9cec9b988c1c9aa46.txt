This code snippet is written in ASP, a server-side scripting language used for creating dynamic web pages.
The first line contains the start tag of an ASP script block, followed by a comment using a single quote.
The next line declares a variable named "str" using the "Dim" statement, followed by assigning the string "Hello, world!" to it.
After that, the value of the variable is displayed using the "Response.Write" method.
The end tag of the ASP script block is denoted by "%>".
The code is encapsulated within triple backticks for proper formatting in annotated markdown.
