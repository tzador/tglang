' This is an ASP code snippet that sets variables and performs various calculations

' Here we set two variables to represent numbers
Dim num1
Dim num2
num1 = 5
num2 = 10

' Now we use an If statement to check if num1 is less than num2
If (num1 < num2) Then
  ' If the condition is true, we perform some calculations
  ' We multiply the two numbers and store the result in a new variable
  Dim result
  result = num1 * num2
  ' We then display the result using Response.Write
  Response.Write("<p>The result is: " & result & "</p>")
  ' We also use a For loop to count from 0 to the result
  ' Each time the loop runs, we display the count using Response.Write
  For i = 0 To result
    Response.Write("<p>" & i & " </p>")
  Next
End If
