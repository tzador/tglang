<!-- This code snippet is an example of using ASP to create a loop that displays a list of names from an array-->

<% Option Explicit %>
<% Response.Buffer = True %>

<%
    ' store the names in an array
    Dim names(4)
    names(0) = "John"
    names(1) = "Jane"
    names(2) = "Mary"
    names(3) = "Peter"
    names(4) = "Mark"

    ' loop through the array and display each name
    For i = 0 To 4
        Response.Write("<p>Name: " & names(i) & "</p>")
    Next
%>

<!-- Output:
<p>Name: John</p>
<p>Name: Jane</p>
<p>Name: Mary</p>
<p>Name: Peter</p>
<p>Name: Mark</p>

By using ASP, we can easily create dynamic content by pulling data from an array and displaying it on a webpage. This code uses the option explicit declaration and sets the response buffer to true, ensuring that all variables are declared and the output is buffered before being sent to the client. We then define the array of names and use a for loop to display each name within a paragraph element. This can be useful for displaying lists of data or creating dynamic navigation menus. 
Note: This code snippet is just an example and would need to be integrated into a complete ASP application to function properly. -->
