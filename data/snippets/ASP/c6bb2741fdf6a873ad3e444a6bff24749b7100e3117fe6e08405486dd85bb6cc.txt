' This is a server-side script in ASP
' Here, we declare a variable named "name" and assign it the value "John Doe"
Dim name
name = "John Doe"

' We then use the Response.Write method to output the value of the "name" variable
Response.Write "Hello " & name & "!"

' Now, we create a conditional statement using the If...ElseIf...Else structure
If name = "John Doe" Then
	Response.Write "You have the same name as the famous Joe Doe!"
ElseIf name = "Jane Doe" Then
	Response.Write "You have the same name as the famous Jane Doe!"
Else
	Response.Write "Your name is unique."
End If

' Next, we create a for loop to output a list of numbers
For i = 1 to 5
	Response.Write i & "<br>"
Next
