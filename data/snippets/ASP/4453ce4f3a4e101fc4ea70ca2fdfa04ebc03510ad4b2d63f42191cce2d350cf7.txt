The code snippet above shows how to receive two numbers through a query string,
calculate their sum, and display the result to the user. 
The first step is to declare three variables - 'num1', 'num2', and 'sum'
which will hold the two numbers and their sum respectively. 
Next, we use the 'Request.QueryString' method to retrieve the two numbers 
from the query string. 
Then, we use the '+' operator to add the two numbers and assign the result 
to the 'sum' variable. 
Finally, we use the 'Response.Write' method to display the result to the user 
in a string format.
