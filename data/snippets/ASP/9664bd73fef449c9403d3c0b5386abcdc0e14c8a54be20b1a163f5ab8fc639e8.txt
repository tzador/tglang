<!-- This code snippet includes variables, arrays, conditionals, and loops -->

' Initialize variables
Dim num1 : num1 = 7
Dim num2 : num2 = 3

' Create and populate an array
Dim fruits(3)

fruits(0) = "apple"

' Create a conditional statement
If (num1 > num2) Then
    ' Loop through array and print each element with index
    For i = 0 To UBound(fruits)
        Response.Write "The fruit at index " & i & " is " & fruits(i) & "<br/>"
    Next

<!-- Output:

The fruit at index 1 is banana
The fruit at index 2 is orange
