' This code snippet is an example of a bubble sort algorithm implemented in ASP
' Bubble Sort function takes in an array of numbers as the input and sorts them in ascending order
' Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of passes
Dim counter
' Initialize a variable to store the length of the input array
Dim length
' Get the length of the input array using the UBound function
length = UBound(arr)
' Use a for loop to iterate through the array
For i = 0 To length - 1
    ' Use a nested for loop to compare elements in the array
    For j = 0 To length - i - 1
        ' Check if the current element is greater than the next element
        If arr(j) > arr(j+1) Then
            ' Swap the elements using a temporary variable
            arr(j+1) = arr(j+1) + arr(j)
            arr(j) = arr(j+1) - arr(j)
            arr(j+1) = arr(j+1) - arr(j)
        End If
    Next
    ' Increment the counter variable after each pass
    counter = counter + 1
Next
' Print the sorted array
Response.Write("Sorted Array:")
For k = 0 To length
    Response.Write(" " & arr(k))
