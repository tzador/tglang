<!--
This code snippet generates a random number between 1 and 10 and stores it in a variable.
It then uses a conditional statement to check if the number is greater than 5.
If the number is greater than 5, it displays a message saying "The number is greater than 5".
Otherwise, it displays "The number is less than or equal to 5".
