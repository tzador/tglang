<!-- This is a comment in ASP -->
<!-- We can declare variables using "Dim" keyword -->
<!-- Like this: -->
Dim num As Integer
Dim str As String
Dim flag As Boolean

<!-- We can also assign values to variables -->
num = 10
str = "Hello World"
flag = True

<!-- We can use conditional statements like if-else -->
If num <= 10 Then
    Response.Write("Value of num is less than or equal to 10")
ElseIf num > 10 And num <= 20 Then
    Response.Write("Value of num is greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20")
Else
    Response.Write("Value of num is greater than 20")
End If

<!-- We can use loops to iterate through a set of statements -->
For i = 0 To 5
    Response.Write("Value of i is " + i.ToString())
Next

<!-- We can also use arrays to store multiple values -->
Dim colors As String() = {"Red", "Green", "Blue"}

<!-- We can loop through arrays using For Each loop -->
For Each color In colors
    Response.Write(color)
Next

<!-- We can use functions to perform specific tasks -->
Function cube(ByVal x As Integer) As Integer
    Return x * x * x
End Function

<!-- We can call the function and store the result in a variable -->
Dim result As Integer = cube(5)

<!-- We can also create and call subroutines without returning any value -->
Sub print(ByVal message As String)
    Response.Write(message)
End Sub

<!-- We can call the subroutine as follows -->
print("Hello ASP")
