<!-- This is a snippet of ASP code that uses a For loop to iterate through an array of numbers and outputs their squares -->

' Declare an array of numbers 
Dim numbers(10)
numbers = Array(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

' Loop through the array using a For loop
For i = 0 To UBound(numbers) 
    ' Calculate the square of the current number
    square = numbers(i) ^ 2
    
    ' Print the square to the webpage 
    Response.Write("The square of " & numbers(i) & " is " & square & "<br>")
