Dim count ' create a variable to count the number of even numbers
count = 1 ' set count to 1

Do While count <= 10 ' loop until we have printed 10 even numbers
	If count Mod 2 = 0 Then ' check if the number is even
		Response.Write(count & "<br>") ' print the number followed by HTML line break
	End If
	
	count = count + 1 ' increment count by 1
Loop

' Output: 2<br>4<br>6<br>8<br>10<br>12<br>14<br>16<br>18<br>20
