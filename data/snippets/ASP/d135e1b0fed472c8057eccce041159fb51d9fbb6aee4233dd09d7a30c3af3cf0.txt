<!--Sample ASP code for retrieving and displaying data from a database-->

<!--I'll be using a connection string to connect to the database-->
<%
dim conn
set conn=Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
conn.Provider="SQLOLEDB"
conn.Open "Data Source=myServer;Initial Catalog=myDatabase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;"
%>

<!--Next, I'll be creating an SQL query to retrieve the data from the database-->
<%
dim cmd
set cmd=Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Command")
cmd.ActiveConnection=conn
cmd.CommandText="SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE column1 = 'value'"

<!--Execute the query and store the results in a recordset-->
dim rs
set rs=Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")
rs.Open cmd, , adOpenStatic

<!--Loop through the recordset and display the results-->
<%
while not rs.EOF
    response.write "Column 1: " & rs("column1") & "<br/>"
    response.write "Column 2: " & rs("column2") & "<br/>"
    response.write "Column 3: " & rs("column3") & "<br/>"
    rs.MoveNext
wend

<!--Close the recordset and database connection-->
<%
rs.Close
set rs=nothing
conn.Close
set conn=nothing
%>

The code snippet above shows how to retrieve and display data from a database using ASP. The first section establishes a connection to the database using a connection string, which includes the server name, database name, and login credentials. Next, an SQL query is created and executed using the connection object. The results are then stored in a recordset, which is looped through to display the data. Finally, the recordset and connection are closed to prevent any potential memory leaks.
