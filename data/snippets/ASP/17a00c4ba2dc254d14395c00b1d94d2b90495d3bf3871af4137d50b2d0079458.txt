' This code snippet demonstrates how to create a variable, perform calculations, and output the result.

'Create a variable called "myNumber" and initialize its value to 5
myNumber = 5

'Create another variable called "myString" and initialize its value to "Hello"
myString = "Hello"

'Perform calculations by adding 10 to myNumber and assigning the result to a new variable called "newNumber"
newNumber = myNumber + 10

'Output the value of myNumber, myString, and newNumber
Response.Write("My Number is: " & myNumber & "<br>")
Response.Write("My String is: " & myString & "<br>")
Response.Write("My New Number is: " & newNumber & "<br>")
