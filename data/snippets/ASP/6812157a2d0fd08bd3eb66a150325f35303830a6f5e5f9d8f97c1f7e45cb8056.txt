<!-- This code snippet is a demonstration of basic control structures in ASP, including a for loop, a do until loop, and a for each loop. The first section declares a string variable and uses a for loop to print it out 10 times with a different number appended each time. The second section uses a do until loop to print out the numbers 2 to 9. The last section uses a for each loop to print out each element in an array. -->
