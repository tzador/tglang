- The first line sets the language used for the ASP code, in this case, VBScript.
- The <html> tag begins the HTML code for the web page.
- The <head> tag contains the title of the page, which will be displayed in the browser's tab.
- The <title> tag sets the title of the page to "ASP Date and Time Example".
- The <body> tag begins the main content of the page.
- The <h1> tag creates a heading with the text "Welcome to my site!".
- The <hr/> tag adds a horizontal line to visually separate the heading from the rest of the content.
- The <p> tag creates a paragraph element.
- The <%= Now %> code snippet dynamically displays the current date and time, retrieved from the server, when the page is loaded.
- The </body> and </html> tags close the respective elements to complete the web page structure.
