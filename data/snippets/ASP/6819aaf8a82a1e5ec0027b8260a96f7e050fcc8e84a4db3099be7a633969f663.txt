'Here, we declare a variable
Dim myVariable

myVariable = "Hello World!"

'The output will be displayed on the page

'Here, we use a conditional statement to check the value of the variable and print different outputs accordingly

Else

'In ASP, we can also use functions to manipulate data
'Here, we use the Len() function to get the length of a string and print it on the page
Response.Write("The length of myVariable is: " & Len(myVariable)) 'This will print "The length of myVariable is: 12" on the page
