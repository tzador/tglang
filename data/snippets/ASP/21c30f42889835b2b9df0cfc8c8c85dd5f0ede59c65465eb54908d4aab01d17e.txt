<!--- This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given integer --->
<%
' Set the input variable to an integer value
n = 5
' Create a variable to store the factorial result
factorial = 1
' Set up a loop to iterate through all numbers less than or equal to n
for i = 1 to n
    ' Multiply the factorial by the current iteration number
    factorial = factorial * i
Next
' Output the factorial result
Response.Write("The factorial of " & n & " is " & factorial)
