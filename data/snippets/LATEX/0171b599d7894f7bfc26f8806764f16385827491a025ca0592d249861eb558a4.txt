\documentclass{article}
% This line specifies the type of document we're creating, in this case an article.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% Specify the encoding for the document, in this case UTF-8.
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
% Specify the font encoding to use.
\usepackage{amsmath}
% This package is used for formatting mathematical equations.
\usepackage{graphicx}
% This package is used for inserting images into the document.
\usepackage{caption}
% This package is used for customizing captions for figures and tables.
\usepackage{hyperref}
% This package is used for creating hyperlinks within the document.
\title{My First Latex Document}
% Specify the title of the document.
\author{John Doe}
% Specify the author of the document.
\date{\today}
% Specify the date for the document, by default it will use the current date.
\begin{document}
\maketitle % This command inserts the title, author, and date specified above.
\section{Introduction} % This command creates a section with the title "Introduction".
Hello, world! This is my first Latex document. It's really exciting to learn this new typesetting language.
% This is a comment, anything that follows a percentage sign (%) is ignored by the compiler.
\subsection{Purpose} % This command creates a subsection with the title "Purpose" within the section "Introduction".
The purpose of this document is to demonstrate the basic syntax and features of Latex.
\section{Components}
% This command creates another section with the title "Components".
\subsection{Equations} % This command creates a subsection with the title "Equations" within the section "Components".
Latex is great for typesetting mathematical equations. Here's an example:
\begin{equation} % This command creates an equation environment.
    f(x) = \int_{0}^{x} e^{-t} \ dt
    % This is a mathematical equation, it will be formatted and displayed properly in the document.
\end{equation}
\subsection{Images} % This command creates a subsection with the title "Images" within the section "Components".
We can also insert images into our document. Here's an example:
\begin{figure}[h] % This command creates a figure environment.
    \centering % This command centers the image.
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image}
    % This command inserts the image, in this case it will use an example image included in the Latex package.
    \caption{Example image} % This command creates a caption for the image.
    \label{fig:example}
    % This command creates a label for the image, so we can refer to it later in the document.
\end{figure}
\subsection{References} % This command creates a subsection with the title "References" within the section "Components".
We can also create hyperlinks within our document. For example, we can refer to the image in the previous subsection using its label:
Figure \ref{fig:example} shows an example of an image inserted in a Latex document.
% This command creates a hyperlink to the image, it will be displayed as "Figure 1" and will be automatically numbered.
\end{document}
% This command marks the end of the document. Anything that follows will not be compiled.
