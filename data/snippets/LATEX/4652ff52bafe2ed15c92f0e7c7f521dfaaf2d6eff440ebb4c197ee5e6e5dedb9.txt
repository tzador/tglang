\section{Introduction}
In this section, I will introduce the various components and packages used in my code snippet. 

\subsection{Equations}
To write mathematical equations, I will be using the \textit{amsmath} package. To display equations, I will use the \texttt{align} environment, which is similar to the \texttt{eqnarray} environment but with better vertical spacing. Here is an example equation:

\begin{align}
f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1
\end{align}

I can also use the \texttt{equation} environment for single equations. 

\subsection{Images}
To include images, I will be using the \textit{graphicx} package. Here is an example of an image included in my document:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image}
    \caption{Example image}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

% hyperlinks
\subsection{Hyperlinks}
To add hyperlinks to my document, I will be using the \textit{hyperref} package. Here is an example of a link:

\href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{This link} will direct you to the official LATEX project website.

% defining new commands
\subsection{New Commands}
To make my code more concise, I have defined some new commands. As seen at the beginning of my code, I have created commands for bold vectors, Euler's number, and partial derivatives. Here is an example of using one of these commands:

\begin{align}
\bvec{v} = \E{\frac{\pi}{4}} \deriv{\bvec{u}}{t}
\end{align}

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, my code snippet is a combination of mathematical equations, images, and hyperlinks. I have also utilized the \textit{amsmath} and \textit{graphicx} packages, as well as created some new commands for convenience. Thank you for reading!
