%\section{Introduction}                                                                 /* Begins a new section titled "Introduction" */
%This is a sample code snippet in LaTeX, designed to demonstrate the use of different packages and commands. Typesetting in LaTeX is highly customizable and offers a variety of options for formatting text and equations.
%\subsection{Formatting text}                                                           /* Begins a subsection titled "Formatting text" */
%In LaTeX, text can be formatted using commands such as \textit{italic} or \textbf{bold}. Additionally, the text can be \underline{underlined} and \textcolor{red}{colored}.
%\subsection{Typesetting equations}                                                     /* Begins a subsection titled "Typesetting equations" */
%Equations can be easily typeset using the \textbf{amsmath} package. For example, the famous Euler's formula $e^{i\pi}+1=0$ can be written in LaTeX as \verb|$e^{i\pi}+1=0$|.
%\[                                                                                     /* Begins a new line for a displayed equation */
%\frac{df}{dx}                                                                         /* Displays the fraction df/dx */
%\]                                                                                     /* Ends the displayed equation line */
%In addition, multiline equations can be created using the \texttt{align} environment:
%\begin{align}                                                                            /* Begins the align environment for multiline equations */
%a &= b + c \\                                                                          /* The "&" symbol aligns the equations at the indicated point */
%&= e - d \\                                                                             /* The "\\" symbol creates a line break */
%&= f + g                                                                               /* Ends the align environment */
%\end{align}                                                                            /* Ends the align environment */
%\section{Conclusion}                                                                  /* Begins a new section titled "Conclusion" */
