In this code snippet, we will explore some key features of LATEX. %adding text to the document
\subsection{Equations} %creating a subsection titled "Equations"
LATEX provides numerous ways to typeset equations, such as the widely used \textit{equation} environment:

\begin{equation} %beginning of equation environment
    E=mc^2 %defining the equation
\end{equation} %end of equation environment

Additionally, the \textit{align} environment can be used for multiple equations with proper alignment:

\begin{align} %beginning of align environment
    a^2+b^2&=c^2 \\ %defining the first equation and using "&" for alignment
    x&=y+z %defining the second equation and using "&" for alignment
\end{align} %end of align environment

\subsection{Figures} %creating a subsection titled "Figures"
LATEX also makes it easy to include figures in your document:

\begin{figure}[h] %beginning of figure environment with placement specifier [h] for "here"
    \centering %command for centering the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} %including the image file with width of 0.5 times the width of the text
    \caption{Example figure} %defining the caption for the figure
    \label{fig:example} %defining the label for referencing the figure
\end{figure} %end of figure environment

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:example}, LATEX automatically handles the placement and numbering of figures.

\subsection{Tables} %creating a subsection titled "Tables"
Tables can also be easily created in LATEX:

\begin{table}[h] %beginning of table environment with placement specifier [h] for "here"
    \centering %command for centering the table
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|} %defining the column format with "|" for vertical lines
        \hline %command for horizontal line
        Column 1 & Column 2 \\ %defining the table headers
        \hline
        Entry 1 & Entry 2 \\ %defining the table entries
        Entry 3 & Entry 4 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular} %end of tabular environment
    \caption{Example table} %defining the caption for the table
    \label{table:example} %defining the label for referencing the table
\end{table} %end of table environment

Tables in LATEX can be customized with various alignment options and additional formatting.

\subsection{Bibliography} %creating a subsection titled "Bibliography"
LATEX also has built-in support for bibliographies and citations:

\begin{thebibliography}{9} %beginning of bibliography environment with maximum number of references set to 9
\bibitem{examplecitation} Examplecitation, 2020 %defining a reference with a label for citation and the year
\bibitem{anothercitation} Anothercitation, 2019 %defining another reference
\end{thebibliography} %end of bibliography environment

These references can then be cited in the document using the \textit{cite} command: \cite{examplecitation}.

\end{document} %end of the document
