\documentclass[12pt]{article} % Declares the document type as "article" with a font size of 12 points
\usepackage{amsmath} % Imports the AMS math package for mathematical symbols
\usepackage{graphicx} % Imports the graphicx package for including images
\usepackage{caption} % Allows for formatting captions for images and tables
\usepackage{lipsum} % Imports filler text package for demonstration purposes

\begin{document} % Begins the document
\begin{figure}[ht] % Begins the figure environment with the placement option of "here, top"
\centering % Centers the figure
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image} % Includes the image "example-image" with a width equal to half of the text width
\caption{\lipsum[1]} % Creates a caption using filler text from the lipsum package
\label{fig:example} % Sets the label for referencing the figure
\end{figure} % Ends the figure environment

\section{Introduction} % Begins the section titled "Introduction"
This is a sample document using the \LaTeX \space programming language. It showcases the implementation of various packages and commands. % Creates a simple introduction paragraph

\lipsum[2] % Inserts filler text for demonstration purposes

\section{Mathematics} % Begins the section titled "Mathematics"
\subsection{Equations} % Begins the subsection titled "Equations"
Here is an example of a simple equation in \LaTeX:

\begin{equation} % Begins the equation environment
    E=mc^2 % Represents the equation "E=mc^2"
\end{equation} % Ends the equation environment

\lipsum[3] % Inserts filler text for demonstration purposes

\subsection{Matrices} % Begins the subsection titled "Matrices"
Another useful feature of \LaTeX \space is its ability to typeset matrices:

\begin{equation} % Begins the equation environment
    A=\begin{pmatrix} % Begins the pmatrix environment for a 2x2 matrix
        a & b \\ % Defines the elements in the first row
        c & d % Defines the elements in the second row
    \end{pmatrix} % Ends the pmatrix environment
\end{equation} % Ends the equation environment

\lipsum[4] % Inserts filler text for demonstration purposes

\section{Conclusion} % Begins the section titled "Conclusion"
In conclusion, \LaTeX \space is a powerful and versatile programming language for creating professional-looking documents with mathematical equations, graphics, and much more. Its use of packages and commands allows for customization and flexibility in its output. It has become a popular choice for academics, scientists, and professionals for its precision and focus on content rather than formatting. % Creates a conclusion paragraph
