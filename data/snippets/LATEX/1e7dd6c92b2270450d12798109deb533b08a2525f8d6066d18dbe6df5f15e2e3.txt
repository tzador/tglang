\documentclass{article} %creates a document of type "article"
\usepackage{amsmath} %imports the amsmath package for advanced math features
\begin{document} %starts the document
\section{Introduction} %creates a section with the title "Introduction"
This document aims to showcase the use of
\textbf{LATEX} for creating complex code snippets. %inserts bold text
\subsection{Equations} %creates a subsection with the title "Equations"
The following equation demonstrates the use of the \textit{equation} environment.
\begin{equation} %starts the equation environment
x^2 + y^2 = z^2 %inserts the equation
\end{equation} %ends the equation environment
We can also use the \textit{align} environment to align multiple equations.
\begin{align} %starts the align environment
x &= 2a + b\\ %inserts the first equation and uses "&" to align it with the next equation
y &= 3c + d\\ %inserts the second equation and uses "&" to align it with the next equation
z &= 4e + f %inserts the third equation
\end{align} % ends the align environment
\section{Tables} %creates a section with the title "Tables"
The following table is created using the \textit{tabular} environment.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} %starts the tabular environment with three columns, with vertical lines separating them
\hline %inserts a horizontal line
\textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} & \textbf{Column 3}\\ %inserts column headers
\hline %inserts a horizontal line
A & 1 & a\\ %inserts the first row of data
B & 2 & b\\ %inserts the second row of data
C & 3 & c\\ %inserts the third row of data
\hline %inserts a horizontal line
\end{tabular}%ends the tabular environment
