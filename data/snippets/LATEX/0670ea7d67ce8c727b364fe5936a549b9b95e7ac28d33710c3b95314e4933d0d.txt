\begin{abstract}
This paper explores the use of one-time pads as a quantum-proof encryption method. We will discuss the theoretical basis of one-time pads and their advantages over traditional encryption methods, and then present a practical implementation of a one-time pad system using quantum key distribution. The effectiveness of this system will be analyzed and compared to other quantum-proof encryption methods.

\section{Introduction}
Encryption is a crucial aspect of securing sensitive information in today's digital age. As technology advances, so too do the methods for breaking traditional encryption algorithms. One of the latest advancements in computing is the development of quantum computers, which have the potential to break current encryption methods with ease. To combat this threat, new encryption methods that are resistant to quantum computing must be developed. In this paper, we will explore the use of one-time pads as a solution to this problem.

% Begin the theoretical background section
\section{Theoretical Background}
One-time pads, also known as Vernam ciphers, were first developed in 1917 by Gilbert Vernam. They are a type of encryption where a random key is used to encrypt a message of the same length. The key and message are combined using a bitwise XOR operation, resulting in a ciphertext that is impossible to decrypt without the key. This method is provably secure as long as the key is truly random and is never reused.

% Begin the implementation section
\section{Implementation}
In order to implement a one-time pad system, we will use a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol to generate a random key. QKD is a method of creating and sharing a key between two parties that is secure against eavesdropping. This key will then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages using the XOR operation described in the previous section.

% Begin the analysis section
\section{Analysis}
To test the effectiveness of our quantum-proof encryption system, we will compare it to other quantum-proof encryption methods such as lattice-based and code-based cryptography. We will analyze the security and efficiency of each method and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.

% Begin the conclusion section
\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, one-time pads offer a promising solution to the problem of quantum-proof encryption. By utilizing a truly random key and leveraging the security of quantum key distribution, we can create an encryption method that is resistant to even the most advanced quantum computing techniques. Further research and development in this area will continue to strengthen the security of our digital information.
