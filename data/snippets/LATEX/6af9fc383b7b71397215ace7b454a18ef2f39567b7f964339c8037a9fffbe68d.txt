\documentclass{article}         % defines the document class as "article"

% include necessary packages
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}     % allows for input of special characters
\use package[T1]{fontenc}       % specifies font encoding
\usepackage{graphicx}           % allows for insertion of graphics
\usepackage{amsmath}            % provides additional math functionality

\begin{document}                % starts the document

\title{Latex Code Snippet}      % creates a title for the document
\author{John Doe}               % sets the author name
\date{\today}                   % specifies today's date as the document date

\maketitle                      % generates the title using the specified information

Hello world!                    % prints "Hello world!" to the document

\section{Introduction}          % creates a section titled "Introduction" 
This is a long and complex code snippet in Latex. It contains various elements such as packages, document class, title, author, date, and different sections.                      

\subsection{Main Structure}     % creates a subsection titled "Main Structure"
The main structure of this document class is article. We have also included several packages to enhance the functionality of our document.

\section{Body}                   % creates a section titled "Body"
In this section, we will discuss the body of our code snippet. It includes insertion of graphics and additional math functionality using the \textit{amsmath} package.

\begin{figure}                  % starts a figure environment
    \centering                  % centers the figure
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image.png}    % includes an image with a scale of 0.5 and named "image.png"
    \caption{Latex Logo}        % creates a caption for the image
    \label{fig:latexlogo}       % assigns a label to the figure for referencing
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:latexlogo}, we have inserted the Latex logo using the \textit{graphicx} package. \\

We can also write equations using Latex, such as the famous Euler's identity: 

\begin{equation}                % starts an equation environment
    e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0            % inserts the equation
    \label{eq:euler}            % assigns a label to the equation for referencing
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:euler} is known as Euler's identity and is often considered one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics.
