\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This is a sample code snippet in \LaTeX. In this code, we will include packages, set up page layout, and create a title for our document.

\subsection{Packages}

To use additional functions and features in our document, we need to include packages. In this code, we have included packages for language localization, font encoding, mathematics, graphics, and float placement.

\subsection{Page Layout}

Next, we will set the dimensions for our document's page layout. Here, we have set the text height to 9 inches, text width to 6.5 inches, top margin to -0.5 inches, even and odd side margins to 0 inches, and the distance between the header and main text to 0.75 inches.

\subsection{Title}

We will now create a title for our document. We give our document a title, author name, and today's date.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, \LaTeX{} is a powerful document preparation system that allows for customization and organization. This code snippet is just an example of how to set up a basic document in \LaTeX.
