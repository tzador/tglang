\documentclass{article}   % Defines the document class for LATEX

\usepackage{amsmath}       % Imports the amsmath package for advanced mathematical features
\usepackage{graphicx}      % Imports the graphicx package for including images in the document

\title{Annotated Code Snippet}   % Sets the title of the document
\author{John Doe}                % Sets the author's name

\begin{document}       % Begins the document

\maketitle             % Generates a title page with the specified title and author

\section{Introduction}   % Creates a new section titled 'Introduction'

This is an example of an annotated code snippet in \LaTeX. It contains various packages and commands that are commonly used in document creation.

\subsection{Mathematical Equations}    % Creates a subsection titled 'Mathematical Equations'

LATEX's amsmath package provides many useful features for creating and formatting mathematical equations. For example, the following equation uses the \texttt{align} environment to align the equal signs and add a label for referencing the equation later on.

\begin{align}
    E = mc^2     % Defines the equation to be displayed
    \label{eq:emc}   % Adds a label to the equation
\end{align}

We can now reference this equation later by using the \texttt{ref} command: Equation \ref{eq:emc}.

\subsection{Including Graphics}     % Creates a subsection titled 'Including Graphics'

The graphicx package can be used to include images in a document. The following code imports an image and sets the size to be 0.5 times the width of the text.

\begin{verbatim}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image}
\end{verbatim}

This will result in the following image being included in the document:

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image}

\section{Conclusion}   % Creates a new section titled 'Conclusion'

In conclusion, LATEX offers a wide range of features for creating professional and well-formatted documents. With the use of packages and commands, users have the ability to customize their documents to fit their needs.  % Prints a conclusion statement

\end{document}   % Ends the document
