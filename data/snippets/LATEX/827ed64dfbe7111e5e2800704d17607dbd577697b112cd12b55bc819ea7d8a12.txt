In this example, we will explore a complex equation using the \texttt{align} environment from the amsmath package. The equation we will be working with is:
% This line provides a description of what the example will show, and the following line shows the actual equation (using the align environment)

\begin{align}
y &= x^2 + 3x - 5 
% This line creates and aligns the equation, with the & symbol marking the point of alignment between the equal sign and the start of the equation
\\ 
&= (x+5)(x-1) 
% This line shows the expanded form of the equation
\\ 
&= 0 
% This line sets the equation equal to 0, showing the possible solutions for x
\end{align}

As we can see, this is a quadratic equation with two possible solutions, x=-5 and x=1. Now let's step through the code used to generate this equation.
% This paragraph briefly explains what the example will show and introduces the equation

\begin{verbatim}
% This line starts a code environment for displaying the code used to generate the equation

\begin{align}
% This line starts the align environment for creating and aligning equations
y &= x^2 + 3x - 5 
% This line is the first part of the equation
\\ 
&= (x+5)(x-1) 
% This line is the expanded form of the equation
\\ 
&= 0 
% This line sets the equation equal to 0, showing the possible solutions for x
\end{align}
