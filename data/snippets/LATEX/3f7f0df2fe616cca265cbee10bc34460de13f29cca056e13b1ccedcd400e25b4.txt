\section{Introduction}
This is an example of a LaTeX document. Here, we will learn how to use various features and packages to create a professional-looking document.

\subsection{Fonts}
LaTeX allows for easy font customization. For example, \textbf{bold} and \textit{italic} text can be easily achieved.

\subsection{Equations}
The \texttt{amsmath} package provides a variety of options for writing complex equations. Here's an example of the equation for calculating the area of a circle with radius $r$:
\begin{equation}
    A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}

\subsection{Figures}
Images can be included in the document using the \texttt{graphicx} package. Here's an example of a figure with a caption:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example_image.jpg}
    \caption{Example Image}
\end{figure}

\subsection{References}
Clickable references and URLs can be easily included using the \texttt{hyperref} package. For example, we can reference a website like this: \href{https://www.google.com}{Google}.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, LaTeX is a powerful tool for creating professional documents with advanced features and customizations. It is widely used in the academic and scientific community, and its learning curve is worth the effort for the high-quality documents it can produce.
