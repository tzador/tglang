LaTeX is a typesetting language used for creating professional and sophisticated documents. % prints the text within the curly braces
It is widely used in academia for writing research papers, thesis, and reports. % prints the text within the curly braces
In this example, we will showcase some of the complex features of LaTeX. % prints the text within the curly braces
\section{Mathematical Equations} % creates a new section titled "Mathematical Equations"
LaTeX has powerful features for typesetting mathematical equations. % prints the text within the curly braces
Below is an example of a complex equation using the \textit{align} environment. % prints the text within the curly braces and italicized
\begin{align*} % starts the align environment for aligning equations
    f(x) &= x^2 + 3x + 2 \\ % aligns the first equation and starts a new line
    &= (x+1)(x+2) % aligns the second equation
\end{align*} % ends the align environment
\section{Figures} % creates a new section titled "Figures"
In addition to equations, LaTeX can also handle images in various formats such as JPEG, PNG, and PDF. % prints the text within the curly braces
The code below includes an image titled "example.png" with a caption and label. % prints the text within the curly braces
\begin{figure}[h] % starts the figure environment and places the figure "here"
    \centering % centers the image
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example.png} % includes the image with specified width
    \caption{Example Image} % adds a caption to the image
    \label{fig:example} % sets a label for the figure
\end{figure} % ends the figure environment
\section{Tables} % creates a new section titled "Tables"
LaTeX also has features for creating professional-looking tables. % prints the text within the curly braces
The code below generates a table with 3 columns and 3 rows, and also adds rules for horizontal and vertical lines. % prints the text within the curly braces
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} % starts the tabular environment with 3 columns and vertical lines
    \hline % adds a horizontal line
    \textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} & \textbf{Column 3} \\ % prints the header row in bold 
    \hline % adds a horizontal line
    Row 1, Column 1 & Row 1, Column 2 & Row 1, Column 3 \\ % prints the first row
    \hline % adds a horizontal line
    Row 2, Column 1 & Row 2, Column 2 & Row 2, Column 3 \\ % prints the second row
    \hline % adds a horizontal line
    Row 3, Column 1 & Row 3, Column 2 & Row 3, Column 3 \\ % prints the third row
    \hline % adds a horizontal line
\end{tabular} % ends the tabular environment
\end{document} % ends the document
