% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
This is a complex LaTeX document that showcases different formatting and features.
In this document, we will be discussing mathematical equations, using custom commands, and including images.

% Mathematical Equations
\section{Mathematical Equations}
Here is an example of a simple equation: $E = mc^2$. 
We can use the \textit{amsmath} package to typeset more complex equations, such as the quadratic formula:
\begin{equation}  % Begins a numbered equation environment
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} % Typesets the quadratic formula in LaTeX syntax
\end{equation}

We can also define a custom command for the arccot function and use it in our equations:
\begin{equation}
    \arccot(x) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan(x) % Uses the custom command in the equation 
\end{equation}

% Custom Commands
\section{Custom Commands}
As mentioned before, we can define custom commands in LaTeX to make typesetting easier.
For example, we defined a custom command for typesetting vectors: $\vect{v}$.
This formatting can be used throughout the document without having to manually bold the text every time.

% Images
\section{Images}
We can also include images in our LaTeX document using the \textit{graphicx} package.
Here is an example of an image being included:
% Inserts an image with the specified width and file name
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example_image.png}

% References
\section{References}
We can also include references and citations in our document.
For example, let's cite a paper: \cite{Einstein_1905}.
We can also include a bibliography section where we list all the sources used in the document.
% Creates a bibliography environment and lists the sources based on the specified style
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{references}
