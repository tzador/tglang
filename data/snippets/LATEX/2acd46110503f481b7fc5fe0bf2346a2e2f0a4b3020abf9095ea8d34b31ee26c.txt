\section{Introduction} % Creating a new section titled "Introduction"

This is an example document written in \LaTeX{}, showcasing some of its features. % Text in regular font

\subsection{Mathematics} % Creating a subsection titled "Mathematics"

LATEX is known for its ability to typeset complex mathematical equations and symbols. For instance, the famous Pythagorean theorem is represented as \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) in inline math mode. % Text in inline math mode

But it can also be written as:
\begin{equation*} % Start of equation environment with no numbering
    c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} % Equation using advanced mathematical symbols
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Lists} % Creating another subsection titled "Lists"

LATEX also has easy ways to create lists. \\
Unordered list:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First bullet point
    \item Second bullet point
\end{itemize}

Ordered list:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First item
    \item Second item
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion} % Creating a new section titled "Conclusion"

This is just a small sample of what LATEX is capable of. It is a powerful tool for creating professional-looking documents with mathematical equations and other advanced features. % Text in regular font
