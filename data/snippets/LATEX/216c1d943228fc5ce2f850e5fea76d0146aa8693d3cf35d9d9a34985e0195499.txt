\section{Introduction}
LATEX is a powerful language used for typesetting and formatting documents. It is commonly used in academia and scientific publishing due to its ability to handle complex equations and figures.

\section{Equations}
LATEX has built-in commands for displaying equations in a variety of formats. For example, the command \verb|\begin{equation}| starts an equation environment and can be used to display a single equation with a numbered label like this:

\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \int_{0}^{x} e^x dx
\end{equation}

Or, the command \verb|\begin{align}| can be used for multiple equations that are aligned at specific points, like this:

\begin{align}
    a &= b + c \\
    x &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a}
\end{align}

\section{Figures}
LATEX is also capable of including images and figures in a document. The \verb|\includegraphics| command allows you to insert an image file into the document. For example, to include an image named "figure.png" with a caption and label, you could use the following code:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figure.png}
    \caption{This is a sample figure}
    \label{fig:sample}
\end{figure}

As you can see, the figure is automatically numbered and can be referenced in the text using the \verb|\ref{label}| command.

\section{Hyperlinks}
In the digital age, it is important to be able to add hyperlinks to a document. LATEX's \verb|\href| command allows you to insert hyperlinks to a webpage or a specific location in the document. For example, to link the text "Click here" to the Google homepage, you could use the code:

\href{https://www.google.com/}{Click here}

This makes it easy to add references and external resources to your document.
