In this section, we will discuss the basics of LATEX coding. % Inserts text into the document

\subsection{History} % Creates a sub-section 
LATEX was created by Leslie Lamport in 1983. % Inserts text into the document

\subsection{Features}
LATEX offers powerful features for typesetting, such as mathematical equations, tables, and figures.

For example, we can use the \textit{amsmath} package to write the famous \textbf{Einstein's equation}:

\begin{equation*}
    E = mc^2
\end{equation*}

% Adds a new section titled "Advanced Usage"
\section{Advanced Usage}

In this section, we will explore some advanced usage of LATEX.

\subsection{Custom Commands}

We can create custom commands to easily format text throughout our document.

For example, we can create a command to italicize text:

\newcommand{\italic}[1]{\textit{#1}}

Now, we can simply use \verb|\italic{text}| to italicize any text we want.

\subsection{Cite References}

We can also add references to our document using the \textit{biblatex} package.

First, create a file named \textit{references.bib} and add your references in the BibTex format.

Then, use \verb|\cite{ref_key}| to cite a reference within the document.
