%% Introduction section
\section{Introduction}
LATEX is a powerful typesetting language that is commonly used for creating scientific and technical documents. It offers a wide range of features for creating high-quality documents with consistent formatting and professional-looking equations.

%% Math equations section
\section{Math Equations}
The \texttt{amsmath} package allows for the inclusion of various types of equations, such as:
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
\end{equation}

%% Figures section
\section{Figures}
The \texttt{graphicx} package allows for the inclusion of figures in different formats, such as PNG, JPG, and PDF. For example:
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image.png}
    \caption{An example image.}
\end{figure}

%% Conclusion section
\section{Conclusion}
This concludes our demonstration of a complex LATEX code snippet with annotations. It is just a glimpse of the possibilities that LATEX offers for creating high-quality documents. With more practice and experience, you can create even more complex and impressive documents.
