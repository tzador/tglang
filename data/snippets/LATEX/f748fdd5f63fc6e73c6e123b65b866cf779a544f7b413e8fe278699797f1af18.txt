\section{Introduction} % Creating a new section

This is a long and complex code snippet in \LaTeX, showcasing various features and packages that can be used in document preparation.

\section{Mathematics} % Creating a new section for mathematical equations

Let's display some advanced mathematical equations:

% Using the align environment for multi-line equations
\begin{align}
    f(x) &= x^2 + 2x + 1 \\ % double backslash for a line break
    &= (x+1)^2 % showing the use of brackets in equations
\end{align}

% Displaying multiple equations with different alignments and labels
\begin{align}
    g(x) &= \sin(x) \label{eq:1} \\ % using the label command to refer to equations later
    h(x) &= \cos(x) \label{eq:2} \\
    j(x) &= \tan(x) \label{eq:3}
\end{align}

% Referring to equations using the label command and the autoref command from the hyperref package
We can see from \autoref{eq:1} that $g(x)$ is a sine function, while \autoref{eq:2} shows that $h(x)$ is a cosine function. Lastly, \autoref{eq:3} demonstrates that $j(x)$ is a tangent function.

\section{Graphics} % Creating a new section for graphics
Let's now include some graphics in our document:

% Using the figure environment for inserting a figure with a caption and label
\begin{figure}[h] % h specifies the placement of the figure (here, 'h' stands for 'here')
    \centering % centering the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image} % including a figure with a width of 50% of the text width
    \caption{This is an example image.} % adding a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:1} % adding a label to refer to the figure later
\end{figure}

% Referring to the figure using the label and autoref command
As seen in \autoref{fig:1}, we can easily include graphics in our document using the \texttt{graphicx} package.

\section{Conclusion} % Creating a new section for the conclusion
In conclusion, this long and complex code snippet showcases some of the powerful features and packages available in \LaTeX. With its typesetting capabilities and advanced mathematical support, \LaTeX is a popular choice for document preparation among scientists and researchers.
