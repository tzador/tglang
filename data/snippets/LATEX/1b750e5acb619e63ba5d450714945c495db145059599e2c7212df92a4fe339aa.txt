Welcome to my LaTeX code snippet! In this code, we will use various packages to create a document with text, math equations, images, and code listings.

\subsection{Packages}            % creates a subsection titled "Packages"

To use different features, we have included several packages. The first one, \texttt{inputenc}, sets the encoding to UTF-8, which allows us to use special characters such as é and ü. Next, we have \texttt{amsmath}, which enables us to write equations using the \texttt{equation} environment, like this:

\begin{equation*}                 % begins a math equation with no number
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2               % shows a simple Pythagorean theorem
\end{equation*}

Similarly, we can add images to our document using the \texttt{graphicx} package. For example, we can insert an image and specify its width using the \texttt{includegraphics} command:

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg}

Finally, we have the \texttt{listings} package, which allows us to display code listings in our document. We can define custom colors using the \texttt{xcolor} package, and then style the code with the \texttt{lstlisting} environment, like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={A simple Python program}]   % begins a code listing with caption and language specified
# This is a comment
print("Hello world!")            % prints "Hello world!" to the console
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Conclusion}             % creates a section titled "Conclusion"

Congratulations, you now have a basic understanding of how to use different packages in LaTeX! You can explore more packages and features to create even more complex and beautiful documents.
