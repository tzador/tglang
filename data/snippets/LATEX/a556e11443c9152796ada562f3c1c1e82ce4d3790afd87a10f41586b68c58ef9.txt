\section{Introduction}

% Write some text
This is a complex code snippet in \LaTeX. It contains annotations describing the different components of the code.

% Begin a new subsection
\subsection{Code declaration}

% Create a new command for a custom function
\newcommand{\customFunction}[2]{\textbf{#1} #2}

% Begin a new paragraph
This code declares a new command called \texttt{customFunction} which takes in two arguments - \texttt{#1} and \texttt{#2}. It then formats the arguments as bold and prints them.

% Begin a new equation
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2 = 385
\end{equation}

% Begin a new paragraph
This is an example of a mathematical equation, with the \texttt{sum} function and the use of indices to denote the range. The output of this equation is the sum of the squares of the first 10 natural numbers.

% Begin a new subsection
\subsection{Code loops}

% Begin a for loop
\begin{verbatim}
    for i in range(1, 10):
        print(i)
\end{verbatim}

% Begin a new paragraph
This is an example of a for loop in \LaTeX, using the \texttt{range} function to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10 and printing each one.

% Begin a new subsection
\subsection{Code conditionals}

% Begin an if statement
\begin{verbatim}
    if x > 0:
        print("Positive number")
    else:
        print("Negative number")
\end{verbatim}

% Begin a new paragraph
Another commonly used feature in programming is conditionals. This code snippet shows an if statement that checks if \texttt{x}, a variable, is greater than 0. If it is, it will print "Positive number", otherwise it will print "Negative number".
