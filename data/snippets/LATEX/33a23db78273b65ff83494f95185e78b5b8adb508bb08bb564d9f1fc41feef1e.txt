\section{Introduction}
This section introduces the background and purpose of the report. It also includes a brief overview of the methods used in the report.

\subsection{Background} % Subsection heading
The background information provides context for the report and explains why the research was conducted.

The study of physics is essential for understanding the natural world and its laws. Through experimentation and mathematical analysis, scientists are able to discover and explain the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy.

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this report is to investigate the motion of a pendulum and analyze its relationship with various physical factors, such as length and mass.

\subsection{Methodology}
The experiment was conducted using a simple pendulum setup, where a mass was attached to a string and allowed to swing freely. The motion of the pendulum was recorded using a stopwatch and the data was analyzed using principles of rotational dynamics and simple harmonic motion.

\section{Theory}
This section explains the theoretical basis for the experiment and provides relevant equations.

\subsection{Rotational Dynamics}
According to the principles of rotational dynamics, the torque acting on an object is equal to the product of its moment of inertia and its angular acceleration. This can be expressed as:

% The following equation is automatically numbered using the 'equation' environment and can be referenced in the text
\begin{equation}
    \tau = I\alpha
\end{equation}

Where $\tau$ is the torque, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.

\subsection{Simple Harmonic Motion}
In simple harmonic motion, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to its displacement from equilibrium. This can be described by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    a = -\omega^2x
\end{equation}

Where $a$ is the acceleration, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium.

\section{Results}
This section presents the results of the experiment in a clear and organized manner. Tables and graphs can be used to display the data.

\subsection{Length of Pendulum}
The length of the pendulum was varied and the period of oscillation was recorded. The data was then plotted on a graph and a best-fit line was generated.

    \label{fig:length_graph} % Adds a label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:length_graph}, the period of the pendulum increases with length. This relationship can be further analyzed using the equation derived in the Theory section:

\begin{equation}
    T \propto \sqrt{L}
\end{equation}

Where $T$ is the period and $L$ is the length of the pendulum.

\subsection{Mass of Pendulum}
Similarly, the mass of the pendulum was varied and the period was recorded. The data was plotted and a best-fit line was generated.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{mass_graph.png}
    \caption{Period vs. Mass of Pendulum}
    \label{fig:mass_graph}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mass_graph} shows that the period of the pendulum is independent of its mass.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the experiment confirmed the relationship between the period and length of a pendulum. It also showed that the mass of the pendulum does not affect its period. These findings align with the theoretical predictions based on rotational dynamics and simple harmonic motion.

Future experiments could investigate the effects of air resistance and other external factors on the motion of a pendulum. The data collected could also be used to create a more accurate equation for predicting the period of a pendulum.
