\begin{document}

\maketitle % Create title page

\section{Introduction} % Create a section

This is my first LATEX document. % Add text to the section

\subsection{Basic Formatting} % Create a subsection

\textbf{Bold text}, \emph{italic text}, and \underline{underlined text} can be easily created in LATEX.\\ % Use backslashes for line breaks
\vspace{2mm} % Add vertical space

\hspace{2cm} LATEX also has a variety of \textit{special characters} such as \& \% \$ \# \_ \{ \} that have special meanings and need to be escaped using a backslash.\\ % \hspace creates horizontal space
\vspace{2mm}

\`{a} and \~{n} can also be created using special commands.\\ % \`{a} creates accented a and \~{n} creates tilde n
\vspace{2mm}

LATEX also allows for \textcolor{blue}{coloring text} and \href{https://www.google.com}{creating links} that open in a web browser.\\ % \textcolor{color}{text} sets text color and \href{url}{text} creates a link
\vspace{2mm}

\section{Equations}

LATEX also excels at typesetting equations. \\

The quadratic formula is given by: \\

\fbox{$x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$} \\ %\dfrac creates a fraction in display style

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are coefficients in the general quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. \\

Some other commonly used equations in physics include: \\

\begin{align*} % Starts an aligned equation environment
\text{Newton's Second Law: } \sum \vec{F} &= m\vec{a} \\ % Use & to align equations
\text{Power: } P &= \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} \\
\text{Einstein's Mass-Energy Equation: } E &= mc^2 \\
\text{Schrodinger's Equation: } i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x,t) &= \hat{H}\Psi(x,t)
\end{align*}

where $m$ is mass, $\Delta W$ is work, $\Delta t$ is time, $c$ is speed of light, $\hbar$ is reduced Planck's constant, $\partial$ is partial derivative, $\Psi$ is the wave function, and $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator.\\

\section{Conclusion}

This concludes my first LATEX document. Thank you for reading! \\
