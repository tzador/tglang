\section{Introduction}           % This command creates a new section with the title 'Introduction'
In this document, we will explore some important mathematical concepts and equations.

\subsection{Pythagorean Theorem}  % This command creates a subsection with the title 'Pythagorean Theorem'
The Pythagorean Theorem states that for a right triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse, the following equation holds: 
\begin{equation*}                 % This environment creates a numbered equation without a label
c^2 = a^2 + b^2                   % This line specifies the equation to be displayed
\end{equation*}                   % This command ends the equation environment

\subsection{Euler's Identity}     % This command creates a subsection with the title 'Euler's Identity'
Euler's identity, named after the mathematician Leonhard Euler, is considered one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics. It states that 
\begin{equation}                  % This environment creates a numbered equation with a label
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0                  % This line specifies the equation to be displayed
\label{eqn:euler}                 % This command assigns the label 'eqn:euler' to this equation for future reference
\end{equation}                    % This command ends the equation environment

We can also express Euler's identity in its equivalent form, known as Euler's formula:
\begin{equation*}
e^{i\theta} = \cos{\theta} + i\sin{\theta}
\end{equation*}                   

\subsection{Taylor Series}        % This command creates a subsection with the title 'Taylor Series'
A Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms, each term representing a higher degree polynomial. This is given by:
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + ...
\end{equation*}
