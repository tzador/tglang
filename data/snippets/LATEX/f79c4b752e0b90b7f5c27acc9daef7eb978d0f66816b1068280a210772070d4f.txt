\section{Introduction}
% creates a new section titled "Introduction"
This document will serve as a guide for calculating student grades for a course. It will include the necessary equations and instructions for using them to calculate grades accurately.

\subsection{Grading Scale}
% creates a subsection titled "Grading Scale"
We will be using a traditional 10-point grading scale for this course, where grades will be assigned based on the following percentages:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | }
    \hline
    \textbf{Letter Grade} & \textbf{Percentage} \\ \hline
    A+ & 97-100 \\ \hline
    A & 93-96 \\ \hline
    A- & 90-92 \\ \hline
    B+ & 87-89 \\ \hline
    B & 83-86 \\ \hline
    B- & 80-82 \\ \hline
    C+ & 77-79 \\ \hline
    C & 73-76 \\ \hline
    C- & 70-72 \\ \hline
    D+ & 67-69 \\ \hline
    D & 63-66 \\ \hline
    D- & 60-62 \\ \hline
    F & Below 60 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Calculating Grades}
% creates a new section titled "Calculating Grades"
To calculate a student's final grade, we will use the following equation:

\begin{equation*}
Final Grade = \frac{Total Points Earned}{Total Points Possible} \times 100
\end{equation*}

This equation will give us the final grade as a percentage. To calculate the total points earned for each student, simply add up all of the points they have earned throughout the course. To calculate the total points possible, add up all of the points available for each assignment, exam, and project.

\subsection{Example}
% creates a subsection titled "Example"
Let's say a student, Alice, earned 80 points out of 100 possible points on her first exam. We can calculate her grade for that exam using the following equation:

\begin{equation*}
Exam Grade = \frac{80}{100} \times 100 = 80\%
\end{equation*}

Alice's final grade for the course can then be calculated by adding up all of her points earned and dividing by the total points possible, as shown in the previous section.

\section{Conclusion}

Calculating student grades using this method will ensure accuracy and consistency. Remember to update grades as assignments are completed, and to use the correct grading scale when assigning letter grades. With this document as a guide, calculating grades should be a breeze. Thank you for reading!
