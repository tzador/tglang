\subsection{History}
% this line creates a subsection titled "History" under the "Introduction" section
LATEX was developed by Leslie Lamport in the 1980s and is based on the typesetting language TEX created by Donald Knuth in the 1970s. It quickly became the standard tool for typesetting in scientific fields due to its advanced features and flexibility.

\section{Basic Formatting}
% this line creates a new section titled "Basic Formatting"
To \textbf{bold} a word in LATEX, use the \textbackslash textbf\{ \} command. The \textit{italic} command \textbackslash textit\{ \} can be used for italicizing. \sout{Strikethrough} can be achieved using the \textbackslash sout\{ \} command.

\section{Math Formulas}
% this line creates a new section titled "Math Formulas"
LATEX has a powerful built-in math typesetting system. We can write inline equations using the \textdollar \textbackslash equation\textdollar \{ \} command. For example, \textdollar x + y = z \textdollar \hspace{2mm} will display as $x+y=z$.
% this is a paragraph of text under the "Math Formulas" section
To display a large equation, use the \textbackslash begin\{equation\} and \textbackslash end{equation} commands. For example, 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{dx} \int_{a}^{x} f(t)dt = f(x).
\end{equation}
% this is a paragraph under the "Math Formulas" section with a displayed equation using the "equation" environment
\subsection{Advanced Math Commands}
% this line creates a subsection titled "Advanced Math Commands" under the "Math Formulas" section
LATEX also provides advanced math commands for writing symbols, matrices, and more complex equations. For example, the \textbackslash sqrt\{ \} command can be used to display square roots and the \textbackslash pmatrix\{ \} command can be used for displaying matrices.
