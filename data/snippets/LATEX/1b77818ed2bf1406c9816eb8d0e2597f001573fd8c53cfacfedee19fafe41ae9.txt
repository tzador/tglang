Proof by contradiction. Assume there exists integers $a, b, c$ and $n > 2$ such that $a^n + b^n = c^n$. 		% Starting of the proof
Subtracting $b^n$ from both sides, we get $a^n = c^n - b^n$. Expanding the right side, we get				% First step of the proof
\begin{align*}									% Start an align environment for aligned equations
	a^n &= c^n - b^n \\							% First equation to be aligned
	&= c(c^{n-1} - b^{n-1}) \\					% Second equation to be aligned
	&= c(a^{n-1} + b^{n-1}) \\					% Third equation to be aligned
\end{align*}

Since $n > 2$, $n-1 > 1$ and $a, b, c$ are integers, we can say that $a^{n-1}$ and $b^{n-1}$ are both integers.	% Explanation for the next step
And since $c$ is also an integer, $c(a^{n-1} + b^{n-1})$ must be a multiple of $a$. But $a^n$ is a multiple of $a$, 	% Explanation for the next step
therefore $c(a^{n-1} + b^{n-1})$ must be a multiple of $a^n$. But $a^n = c(c^{n-1} - b^{n-1})$, which is not 		% Explanation for the next step
possible since the left and right sides have different prime factorizations. Thus, our assumption is false and 		% Explanation for the next step
Fermat's Last Theorem is proven.																			% Explanation for the last step
