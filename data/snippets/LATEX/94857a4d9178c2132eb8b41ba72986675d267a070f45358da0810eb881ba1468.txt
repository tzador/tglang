    \section{Introduction} % creates a new section
    In this document, we will explore arithmetic operations in \LaTeX.
    \begin{theorem} % starts theorem environment
        The addition law states that for any two numbers $a$ and $b$,
        $a + b = b + a$. % inserts math symbols using $ $
    \end{theorem} % ends theorem environment
    \subsection{Addition} % creates a new subsection
    To add two numbers in \LaTeX, we use the \verb|+| symbol.
    For example, to add 2 and 3, we type \verb|2 + 3|. % uses \verb to insert code within the text
    This will produce the result $2 + 3 = 5$.
    \subsection{Subtraction}
    Subtraction is similar to addition,
    we just use the \verb|-| symbol instead.
    For example, to subtract 5 from 10, we type \verb|10 - 5|.
    This will give us $10 - 5 = 5$.
    \section{Conclusion}
    We have seen some basic arithmetic operations in \LaTeX,
    including the addition and subtraction laws.
