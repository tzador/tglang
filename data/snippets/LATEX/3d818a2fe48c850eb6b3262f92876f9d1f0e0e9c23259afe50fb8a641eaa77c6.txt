\documentclass{article} % command to create a new document in LaTeX

% Packages for additional functionality
\usepackage{amsmath} % for additional math symbols and environments
\usepackage{graphicx} % for including images in the document
\usepackage{hyperref} % for adding hyperlinks within the document

\title{My First LaTeX Document} % title of the document
\author{John Doe} % author of the document
\date{\today} % date of the document, can be manually specified if needed

\begin{document} % command to begin the document

\maketitle % prints the title, author, and date at the top of the document

\section{Introduction} % command to create a new section

This is my first LaTeX document. % introduction text

\subsection{Background} % command to create a subsection

LaTeX is a typesetting language used to create professional-looking documents. It is often used in academia for writing research papers, reports, and presentations. % background text

\section{Mathematics} % command to create a new section for mathematics

LaTeX has extensive capabilities for typesetting mathematical equations. For example, the Pythagorean theorem can be written as: % introduction text

\begin{equation*} % command to start an unnumbered equation
    c^2 = a^2 + b^2 % equation for the Pythagorean theorem
\end{equation*}

Another useful feature is the ability to label equations and refer to them within the document. For example, the Fourier transform equation can be labeled as:

\begin{equation} % command to start a numbered equation
    F(u) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-2\pi iut} dt % equation for the Fourier transform
    \label{fourier} % label for referencing the equation later
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{fourier} is the Fourier transform equation. % referencing the labeled equation 

\section{Figures} % command to create a new section for figures

Figures can also be easily included in LaTeX documents. For example, the following code inserts a figure of a sine wave:

\begin{figure}[h] % command to start a figure with placement specifier 'h'
    \centering % command to center the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{sine_wave.png} % command to include the figure with specified width
    \caption{Sine wave with an amplitude of 1} % caption for the figure
    \label{sine wave} % label for referencing the figure later
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{sine wave} shows a sine wave with an amplitude of 1. % referencing the labeled figure

\section{Hyperlinks} % command to create a new section for hyperlinks

Hyperlinks can be easily added in LaTeX documents using the \textit{hyperref} package. For example, the following code creates a hyperlink to the LaTeX website:

\href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{LaTeX website} % command to create a hyperlink with specified text and URL

This is the LaTeX website. % text that is hyperlinked

\end{document} % command to end the document and generate the final output
