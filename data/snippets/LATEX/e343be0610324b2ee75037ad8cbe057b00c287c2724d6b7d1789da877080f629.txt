\section{Introduction} % starts a new section
This is a complex and long code snippet written in \LaTeX. It includes several packages and settings to enhance the document's appearance and functionality.
\subsection{Math Tools} % starts a subsection
We can use the \verb|\begin{equation}| and \verb|\end{equation}| commands to write mathematical equations, like the famous Pythagorean Theorem: 
\begin{equation} % starts an equation
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 
\end{equation} % ends the equation
We can also use the \verb|\begin{align}| and \verb|\end{align}| commands to align multiple equations:
\begin{align} % starts an align environment
2x + 3y &= 8 \\ % the double backslash starts a new line
5x - y &= 2 
\end{align} % ends the align environment
\subsection{Figures} % starts a subsection
We can use the \verb|\begin{figure}| and \verb|\end{figure}| commands to insert figures, like this cute cat picture:
\begin{figure}[h] % starts a figure environment with placement specifier
\centering % centers the figure
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{cat.jpg} % includes the cat image with 0.5 times the document's width
\caption{A cute cat} % adds a caption
\label{fig:cat} % adds a label for referencing later
\end{figure} % ends the figure environment
\subsection{Hyperlinks} % starts a subsection
We can use the \verb|\url| command from the \verb|hyperref| package to include clickable URLs, like this one to my favorite search engine \url{https://www.google.com/}.
\subsection{References} % starts a subsection
We can use the \verb|\ref| command to reference figures, equations, and sections within the document. For example, Figure \ref{fig:cat} shows a cute cat. 
% We can also use the \verb|\cite| command to add references to a bibliography, but we won't do that here.
\section{Conclusion} % starts a new section
That's it for this complex code snippet! Hopefully, you now have a better understanding of \LaTeX. Thanks for reading. % some closing words
