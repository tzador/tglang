\author{John Doe} 
\date{\today} % automatically formats date as per language 
\begin{document} % start of document environment 
\maketitle % inserts title, author, and date at the top of the document 
\tableofcontents % inserts table of contents 
\section{Introduction} % start of section 
This is a basic LaTeX code snippet that showcases some commonly used packages and commands. 
\section{Images} 
To insert an image in your document, use the \textbackslash includegraphics command. 
\subsection{Scaling} 
You can also scale the image to a specific size by using the \textbackslash scalebox command. 
\begin{figure}[h] % start of figure environment 
 \centering % center the image 
 \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image.jpg} % insert image with 50% scaling 
 \caption{Example Image} % add a caption 
 \label{fig:image} % label the figure for referencing 
\end{figure} % end of figure environment 
\section{Mathematics} 
LaTeX is great for typesetting mathematical equations. 
\subsection{Inline Equations} 
You can typeset equations within the text by enclosing them in single dollar signs, like $E=mc^2$. 
\subsection{Equations on Their Own Line} 
For longer and more complex equations, enclose them in double dollar signs for proper formatting: 
$$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} $$ 
\section{Conclusion} 
This concludes our introduction to LaTeX. Remember to always run the code multiple times to ensure proper cross-referencing and table of contents. Have fun!
