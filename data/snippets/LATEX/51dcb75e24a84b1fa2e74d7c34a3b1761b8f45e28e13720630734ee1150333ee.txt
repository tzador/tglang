In this code snippet, we will be generating a complex equation using the \textit{amsmath} and \textit{amssymb} packages.

\begin{equation*} % creating an unnumbered equation
f(x) = \int_{a}^{b} \alpha \cdot g(x) dx % defining the equation
\end{equation*}

Where:
\begin{itemize} % creating a list with bullet points
    \item $f(x)$ is a function
    \item $a$ and $b$ are the lower and upper bounds of the integral
    \item $\alpha$ is a constant value
    \item $g(x)$ is another function
    \item $dx$ represents the infinitesimal change in $x$
\end{itemize}

Now, let's add some graphical element to our equation using the \textit{graphicx} package.

\begin{figure}[h] % creating a floating figure with 'here' placement
    \centering % aligning the figure to center
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graph.png} % inserting the graph from an external file, with width equal to half of the text width
    \caption{Graph of $f(x)$} % adding a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:graph} % adding a label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:graph}, the function $f(x)$ reaches its maximum value at $x = c$, which is the point of intersection of the two curves.

Next, let's demonstrate how to solve a system of equations using the \textit{mathtools} package.

\begin{align*} % creating an aligned block of equations
    2x + 3y &= 8 \\ % first equation
    4x - 5y &= -9 % second equation
\end{align*}
Solving the above system of equations, we get $x=1$ and $y=2$.

Lastly, we will use the \textit{setspace} package to change the line spacing for a specific portion of text.

\begin{spacing}{1.5} % changing the line spacing to 1.5
This text has a line spacing of 1.5. % adding sample text
\end{spacing}
