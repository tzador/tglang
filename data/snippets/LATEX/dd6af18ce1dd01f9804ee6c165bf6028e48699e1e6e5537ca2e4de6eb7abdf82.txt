This is a long and complex code snippet written in LaTeX language.
From creating a document to inserting graphics and equations, this snippet covers multiple aspects of LaTeX programming.
Let's get started!

\section{Introduction}              %starts a new section
Welcome to my first LaTeX document!

In this section, we will learn how to include graphics and equations in our document.

\subsection{Inserting Graphics}    %starts a subsection
To insert a graphic, we use the \textit{graphicx} package.

\begin{figure}[h]                   %starts a new figure environment and adds a caption below the image
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg}      %inserts the image with 0.5 text width
    \caption{This is a sample image.}
\end{figure}

\vspace{2mm} %adds a small vertical space

We can also change the size of the image by specifying a different width parameter.

\subsection{Displaying Equations}   %starts another subsection
To display mathematical equations, we use the \textit{amsmath} package.

\vspace{2mm}

Here is a simple equation:

\begin{equation}    %starts an equation environment
    y = mx + b
\end{equation}

\vspace{2mm}

We can also add colors to our equations:

\begin{equation*}   %starts an unnumbered equation environment
    \color{red}{E = mc^2}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Conclusion}  %starts another subsection
Congratulations! You now know how to include graphics and equations in your LaTeX document.
