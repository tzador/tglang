%% Example1 : This is a complex LaTeX code snippet

\documentclass{article}      	%telling LaTeX the type of document we are creating
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}		%setting the encoding of the text file
\usepackage{amsmath}				%loading a package to use advanced math commands

\title{LaTeX Example}         	%setting the title of the document
\author{John Doe}             	%setting the author name
\date{\today}                 	%setting the date as today's date

\begin{document}				%starting the document 
\maketitle                			%inserting the title, author, and date into document

\section{Introduction}			%creating a new section with the title "Introduction"

This is an example of a complex LaTeX code snippet. 
In this snippet, we are creating a document with the title "LaTeX Example" written by John Doe and dated today. 

\subsection{Equations}		%creating a subsection with the title "Equations"

Now, let's showcase some advanced math commands using the \texttt{amsmath} package.
First, we can use the \texttt{align} environment to align multiple equations at the equal sign:
\begin{align}
a+b &= c \\
a^2 + b^2 &= c^2
\end{align}
Next, we can use the \texttt{gather} environment to center multiple equations:
\begin{gather}
a+b+c+d = e \\
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = e^2
\end{gather}
And lastly, we can use the \texttt{equation} environment to number a single equation:
\begin{equation}
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1
\end{equation}

\section{Conclusion}			%creating a new section with the title "Conclusion"

In conclusion, LaTeX is a powerful tool for typesetting documents with complex mathematical equations. With the use of packages such as \texttt{amsmath}, we can easily create professional-looking documents. Thank you for reading!
