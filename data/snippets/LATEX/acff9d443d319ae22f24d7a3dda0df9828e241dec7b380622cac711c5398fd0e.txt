%introduction%
\section{Introduction}
LaTeX is a typesetting language used for creating scientific and technical documents. It is known for its ability to produce high-quality, professional-looking documents with complex layouts and equations.

%body of document%
\section{Basic Usage}
To create a new paragraph, simply leave a blank line between the previous paragraph and the new one. LaTeX will automatically indent the new paragraph and add proper spacing between the paragraphs.

%lists%
\subsection{Lists}
There are three types of lists in LaTeX: itemize, enumerate, and description. The itemize environment is used for unordered lists, while the enumerate environment is used for ordered lists. The description environment is used for lists with descriptions for each item.

\begin{itemize}
\item This is the first item in the list.
\item This is the second item in the list.
\item This is the third item in the list.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item First item in the list.
\item Second item in the list.
\item Third item in the list.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{description}
\item[Item 1:] This is the description for the first item.
\item[Item 2:] This is the description for the second item.
\item[Item 3:] This is the description for the third item.
\end{description}

%equations%
\section{Equations}
LaTeX is known for its ability to typeset complex equations and mathematical expressions. It offers a variety of options for formatting and aligning equations.

%inline equations%
\subsection{Inline Equations}
To include an equation within a paragraph, surround it with single dollar signs. For example: The Pythagorean Theorem is $a^2 +b^2 = c^2$.

%displayed equations%
\subsection{Displayed Equations}
To display an equation on its own line, surround it with double dollar signs or use the \verb|\[| and \verb|\]| commands. For example:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

\[f(x) = \int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx\]

%figures%
\section{Figures}
To include images or figures in a LaTeX document, the graphicx package is needed. First, the image file needs to be in the same directory as the LaTeX file. Then, the \verb|\includegraphics| command can be used.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example_image.jpg}
\caption{Example Image}
\end{figure}

%references%
\section{References}
To add references or citations in a LaTeX document, the \verb|\cite| command can be used. The references can be managed using a .bib file and can be cited with a specific style.

%bibliography%
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{references}

\end{document}
