\section{Introduction} % add a section for introduction

This is a sample document that uses the TikZ package for drawing. We will add some simple shapes and arrows to demonstrate some of its capabilities.

\subsection{Basic Shapes} % add a subsection for basic shapes

We can use the \texttt{tikzpicture} environment to draw shapes within our text. For example, we can use the \verb|\node| command to draw a rectangle:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node [rectangle,draw] (rect) at (0,0) {This is a rectangle}; % create a rectangle node with a label
\end{tikzpicture}

We can also use the \verb|\draw| command to create a line or shape. For example, we can create a circle with a specific radius using the \verb|\draw| command:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw (0,0) circle (1cm); % draw a circle at (0,0) with radius 1cm
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Backgrounds and Patterns} % add another subsection for backgrounds and patterns

We can add color and patterns to our shapes using the \verb|\fill| and \verb|\pattern| commands. Here is an example of a rectangle with a dashed pattern:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\fill [pattern=dashed] (0,0) rectangle (2,1); % add a dashed pattern to a rectangle
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Arrows} % add a subsection for arrows

We can use the \verb|\draw| command to create arrows between nodes. Here is an example of an arrow pointing from one node to another:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node [circle,draw] (A) at (0,0) {A}; % create a circle node with a label "A"
\node [circle,draw] (B) at (2,0) {B}; % create a circle node with a label "B"
\draw [->] (A) -- (B); % draw an arrow from node A to node B
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Positioning} % add a subsection for positioning

We can use the \verb|positioning| library to specify the position of nodes relative to each other. Here is an example of two nodes positioned next to each other:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node [circle,draw] (A) at (0,0) {A}; % create a circle node with a label "A"
\node [circle,draw,right=of A] (B) {B}; % create a circle node with a label "B" positioned to the right of node A
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Fitting Nodes within a Shape} % add a subsection for fitting nodes within a shape

We can use the \verb|fit| command to fit multiple nodes within a specific shape. Here is an example of three nodes fitted within a rectangle:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node [circle,draw] (A) at (0,0) {A}; % create a circle node with a label "A"
\node [circle,draw] (B) at (2,1) {B}; % create a circle node with a label "B"
\node [circle,draw] (C) at (2,-1) {C}; % create a circle node with a label "C"
\node [fit=(A) (B) (C),rectangle,draw] {}; % fit nodes A, B, and C within a rectangle
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Calculations and Labels} % add a subsection for calculations and labels

We can perform calculations and add labels to our shapes using the \verb|\coordinate| and \verb|\node| commands. Here is an example of a circle with a label at a specific coordinate:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\coordinate (O) at (0,0); % specify the coordinate "O" at (0,0)
\node [circle,draw] at (O) {O}; % draw a circle at coordinate O with a label "O"
\node [circle,draw] at ($ (O) + (2,1) $) {A}; % draw a circle at a calculated coordinate (2,1) from coordinate O with a label "A"
\end{tikzpicture}
