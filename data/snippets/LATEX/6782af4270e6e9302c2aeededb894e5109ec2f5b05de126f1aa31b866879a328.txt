\begin{customthm}[Pythagorean Theorem]\label{pythag}
    For a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
\end{customthm}

% Use the custom theorem
According to Theorem \ref{pythag}, we can calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the formula $c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
