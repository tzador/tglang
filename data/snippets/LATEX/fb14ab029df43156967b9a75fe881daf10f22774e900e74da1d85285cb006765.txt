\section{Introduction}   %Creating first section of document
In this document, we will explore the use of \LaTeX{} for creating complex documents. %Adding text to document

\subsection{Motivation}   %Creating subsection in introduction section
The traditional word processors often struggle with equations and complex formatting, but \LaTeX{} offers a more elegant solution.

\section{Equations}    %Creating second section of document
\subsection{Inline equations}   %Creating subsubsection in equations section
We can write equations in the middle of a sentence using \$ and \$ tags. For example, the quadratic formula is written as $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

\subsection{Display equations}   %Creating another subsubsection
We can also display equations separately using the \texttt{equation} environment. For example, the Pythagorean theorem can be written as:

\begin{equation}    %Starting equation environment
a^2 + b^2 = c^2    %Writing equation
\end{equation}    %Ending equation environment

\subsection{Multiple equations}   %Creating another subsubsection
We can also align multiple equations using the \texttt{align} environment. For example, the derivative of $f(x) = \sin(x)$ can be written as:

\begin{align}    %Starting align environment
\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)) &= \cos(x)    %Writing first equation and aligning with &
\\    %Adding new line
&= -\sin(x)    %Writing second equation and aligning with &
\end{align}    %Ending align environment

\section{Lists}   %Creating third section of document
\subsection{Unordered lists}   %Creating subsubsection in lists section
We can create bulleted lists using the \texttt{itemize} environment. For example:

\begin{itemize}    %Starting itemize environment
\item First item    %Writing first item
\item Second item    %Writing second item
\item Third item    %Writing third item
\end{itemize}    %Ending itemize environment

\subsection{Ordered lists}   %Creating another subsubsection
We can create numbered lists using the \texttt{enumerate} environment. For example:

\begin{enumerate}    %Starting enumerate environment
\item First item    %Writing first item
\item Second item    %Writing second item
\item Third item    %Writing third item
\end{enumerate}    %Ending enumerate environment

\section{Conclusion}     %Creating final section of document
In conclusion, \LaTeX{} provides a powerful and efficient way to create complex documents with ease and elegance.
