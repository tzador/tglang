\documentclass{article} % This line of code defines the document class as "article"
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % This line loads the input encoding package "utf8"

\title{My Document} % This line sets the title of the document as "My Document"
\author{John Doe} % This line sets the author of the document as "John Doe"

\begin{document} % This line marks the beginning of the document
\maketitle % This line generates the title based on the \title and \author commands

This is my first document in \LaTeX. % This line prints the text "This is my first document in LaTeX."

\section{Introduction} % This line creates a section titled "Introduction"

Welcome to my document. In this section, we will discuss the basics of \LaTeX. % This line prints the introductory text for this section

\subsection{What is \LaTeX?} % This line creates a subsection titled "What is LaTeX?"

\LaTeX{} is a typesetting system used to create high-quality documents. % This line defines what \LaTeX is and adds a small space after the command to separate it from the following text.

Some of the features of \LaTeX{} include its ability to handle complex mathematical equations, generate automated table of contents, and produce professional-looking documents. % This line elaborates on the features of \LaTeX.

\subsubsection{History of \LaTeX} % This line creates a subsubsection titled "History of LaTeX"

\LaTeX{} was created by Leslie Lamport in the 1980s. It is based on the typesetting system \TeX{} created by Donald Knuth. % This line provides information about the history of \LaTeX.

\section{Basic Elements} % This line creates a section titled "Basic Elements"

In this section, we will discuss the basic elements of a \LaTeX{} document such as paragraphs, lists, and pictures.

\subsection{Paragraphs} % This line creates a subsection titled "Paragraphs"

Paragraphs in \LaTeX{} are created by leaving an empty line between blocks of text. % This line explains how to create paragraphs in \LaTeX.

\subsection{Lists} % This line creates a subsection titled "Lists"

There are three types of lists in \LaTeX{}: unordered lists, ordered lists, and description lists. % This line introduces the types of lists in \LaTeX.

\subsubsection{Unordered Lists} % This line creates a subsubsection titled "Unordered Lists"

Unordered lists can be created using the \texttt{itemize} environment. % This line explains how to create unordered lists in \LaTeX.

\begin{itemize} % This line begins the itemize environment
    \item First item % This creates the first item in the list
    \item Second item % This creates the second item in the list
    \item Third item % This creates the third item in the list
\end{itemize} % This line ends the itemize environment

\subsubsection{Ordered Lists} % This line creates a subsubsection titled "Ordered Lists"

Ordered lists can be created using the \texttt{enumerate} environment. % This line explains how to create ordered lists in \LaTeX.

\begin{enumerate} % This line begins the enumerate environment
    \item First item % This creates the first item in the list
    \item Second item % This creates the second item in the list
    \item Third item % This creates the third item in the list
\end{enumerate} % This line ends the enumerate environment

\subsubsection{Description Lists} % This line creates a subsubsection titled "Description Lists"

Description lists can be created using the \texttt{description} environment. % This line explains how to create description lists in \LaTeX.

\begin{description} % This line begins the description environment
    \item[LaTeX] A typesetting system used to create high-quality documents
    \item[TeX] A typesetting system created by Donald Knuth % This creates the items and their descriptions in the list.
\end{description} % This line ends the description environment

\subsection{Pictures} % This line creates a subsection titled "Pictures"

Pictures in \LaTeX{} can be included using the \texttt{graphicx} package. % This line explains how to include pictures in \LaTeX.

\begin{figure}[h] % This line begins the figure environment and sets the placement of the figure to "here"
    \centering % This line centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{picture.jpg} % This line includes the picture with a width of half of the text width
    \caption{A picture in \LaTeX} % This line adds a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:picture} % This line adds a label to the figure for referencing in the text
\end{figure} % This line ends the figure environment

As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:picture}, pictures can be easily included in \LaTeX{} documents.
