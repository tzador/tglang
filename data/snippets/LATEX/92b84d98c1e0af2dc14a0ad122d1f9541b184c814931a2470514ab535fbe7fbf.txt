\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{my_image.png}
    \caption{This is my image}
    \label{fig:my_image}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:my_image}, we can see the image I have inserted using the command \textit{includegraphics}. This command allows me to specify the width of the image and the file name. I have also added a caption using the \textit{caption} command and a label using the \textit{label} command, which allows me to easily refer to this figure later in the document.

This figure is placed using the \textit{h} option, which gives it a "here" placement preference. This may not be the best placement, so I can also use \textit{t} for "top" or \textit{b} for "bottom". If I don't specify any preference, the figure will be placed where it looks best according to LaTeX's algorithms.

I can also specify the position of the figure using coordinates, for example:

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{my_image.png}
    \caption{This is my image again}
    \label{fig:my_image2}
    \vspace{-5mm} % This negative vertical space decreases the gap between the image and the text below it
\end{figure}

As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:my_image2}, I have used the \textit{width} command to specify the size of the image as half of the text width. I have also added some negative vertical space to decrease the gap between the image and the caption. This gives more control over the placement of figures in LaTeX.
