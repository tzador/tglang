\documentclass{article} % Defines the type of document we're creating (article, report, book, etc.)
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % Allows the use of accented characters
    \usepackage{amsmath} % Allows the use of math symbols and equations
    \usepackage{graphicx} % Allows the use of images in the document
    \usepackage{hyperref} % Allows the creation of hyperlinks within the document
    
    \title{My Complex LaTeX Code} % Specifies the title of the document
    \author{John Doe} % Specifies the author of the document
    \date{\today} % Specifies the date the document was created
    
    \begin{document} % Begins the document
    
    \maketitle % Inserts the title, author, and date into the document
    
    \tableofcontents % Generates a table of contents based on sections and subsections in the document
    
    \section{Introduction} % Creates a section titled "Introduction"
    
    Welcome to my complex LaTeX code! This document will showcase various features and functions of the LaTeX typesetting system.
    
    \section{Math Equations} % Creates a section titled "Math Equations"
    
    LaTeX is known for its powerful abilities in typesetting math equations. Let's try out some examples:
    
    \subsection{The Pythagorean Theorem} % Creates a subsection titled "The Pythagorean Theorem"
    
    The Pythagorean Theorem is a famous math equation that states $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ for a right triangle where $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse. We can also write it in LaTeX using the \verb|\begin{equation}| and \verb|\end{equation}| commands:
    
    \begin{equation}
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    \end{equation}
    
    \subsection{Limits} % Creates a subsection titled "Limits"
    
    Another commonly used math equation is a limit. We can write a limit using the \verb|\lim| command:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0
    \end{equation}
    
    \subsection{Summation} % Creates a subsection titled "Summation"
    
    Summation is a useful tool in math for adding up a sequence of numbers. We can write a summation using the \verb|\sum| command:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
    \end{equation}
    
    \section{Inserting Images} % Creates a section titled "Inserting Images"
    
    LaTeX also allows us to insert images into our document. Let's try it out:
    
    \begin{figure}[h] % Begins the figure environment
        \centering % Centers the image
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{cat.jpg} % Inserts the image with a width of half the text width
        \caption{A beautiful cat} % Adds a caption to the image
        \label{fig:cat} % Creates a label for referencing the image
    \end{figure}
    
    As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:cat}, we can easily insert and label images in our document using LaTeX.
    
    \section{Hyperlinks} % Creates a section titled "Hyperlinks"
    
    Another handy feature of LaTeX is the ability to create clickable hyperlinks within the document. Let's try it out:
    
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX}{LaTeX} is a powerful typesetting system that is widely used in academia and scientific research.
