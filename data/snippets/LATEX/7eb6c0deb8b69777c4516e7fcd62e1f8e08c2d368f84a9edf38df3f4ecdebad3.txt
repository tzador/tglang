\documentclass{article} %defines the type of document

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %imports the necessary packages for encoding characters

\usepackage{amsmath} %imports the American Mathematical Society package for advanced math formatting

\usepackage{graphicx} %imports the package for including images

\title{Complex Document} %sets the title of the document
\author{John Doe} %sets the author of the document
\date{\today} %sets the date of the document to today's date

\begin{document} %begins the document

\maketitle %generates the title page

\section{Introduction} %creates the first section of the document
This is a complex document written using \LaTeX. %creates a paragraph with text and a special \LaTeX command

\subsection{Purpose} %creates a subsection within the first section
The purpose of this document is to demonstrate the use of various \LaTeX{} commands. %creates a paragraph with text and two special \LaTeX commands

\section{Math Formatting} %creates the second section of the document
Here is an example of an \textit{inline equation}: $E=mc^2$. %creates a paragraph with text and an italicized phrase, as well as an equation using the \textit{math mode}

Here is an example of a \textit{displayed equation}:
\begin{equation*} %begins a displayed equation without numbering
    \sin(x) + \cos(x) = \frac{1}{2}. %creates a displayed equation with text and a mathematical expression
\end{equation*}
We can also use the \verb|\[| and \verb|\]| tags for displayed equations without numbering:
\[ %begins a displayed equation without numbering
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{n} = \int_{0}^{1} x^2 dx. %creates a displayed equation using \verb|\[| and \verb|\]| tags and mathematical expressions
\]

\section{Figures} %creates the third section of the document
Here is an example of an included figure:
\begin{figure}[h] %defines the properties of the figure, such as positioning and size
    \centering %centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figure.jpg} %includes the image with a width of half the page width
    \caption{Example figure.} %sets the caption for the figure
    \label{fig:example} %sets a label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}
As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:example}, our figure is included and labeled correctly.

\section{Conclusion} %creates the fourth section of the document
This document has demonstrated the use of various \LaTeX{} commands for creating a complex document. Additional commands and packages can be explored for further customization and formatting options.
