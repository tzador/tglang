\section{Introduction} %first section of document
This code snippet demonstrates the use of different packages and document formatting options in \LaTeX{}. %introductory text

\subsection{Packages} %subsection within first section
To use the \textit{inputenc} package, we need to specify the encoding format for our document by using the \texttt{usepackage} command. %describes purpose of package
Similarly, we use the \texttt{usepackage} command to load the \textit{fontenc} package for font encoding. %describes purpose of package

\subsection{Title, Author and Date} %subsection within first section
To add a title, author and date to our document, we use the \texttt{title}, \texttt{author} and \texttt{date} commands, followed by the text we want to display. %explains how to add title, author and date

\section{Document Formatting} %second section of document
The start of a section is denoted by the \texttt{section} command. %explains how to start a new section
Text can be formatted using different commands such as \texttt{textit} for italics, \texttt{textbf} for bold and \texttt{texttt} for typewriter font. %describes how to format text
To add a subsection within a section, we use the \texttt{subsection} command. %explains how to add a subsection
To format code snippets, we use the \texttt{verbatim} environment, which preserves the original spacing and special characters. %explains how to format code snippets

\subsection{Conclusion} %subsection within second section
This concludes our code snippet. Hopefully, it has provided a good understanding of the basics of document formatting in \LaTeX{}. %concluding remarks
