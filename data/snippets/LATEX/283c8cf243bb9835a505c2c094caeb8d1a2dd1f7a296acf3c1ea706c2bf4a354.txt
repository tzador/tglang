\section{Introduction}
LATEX is a popular typesetting language used for creating documents of various types, such as reports, books, and articles. It is known for its high-quality typesetting and customization options.

\subsection{History of LATEX}
LATEX was created in the 1980s by Leslie Lamport, based on the TEX typesetting system created by Donald Knuth. It has since become the standard for creating scientific and technical documents.

\section{Basics of LATEX}
\subsection{Document Structure}
A LATEX document consists of a \verb|\documentclass| declaration, which defines the type of document, followed by the \verb|\begin{document}| and \verb|\end{document}| commands, which mark the beginning and end of the document.

\subsection{Packages and Preamble}
Packages are used to extend the functionality of LATEX and are imported using the \verb|\usepackage| command. The preamble, located before the \verb|\begin{document}| command, is used to define the document's parameters and settings.

\section{Mathematical Typesetting in LATEX}
LATEX is widely used for its ability to typeset complex mathematical equations and expressions. This is achieved using the math mode environment, denoted by the \verb|$| symbol.

\subsection{Equations}
Equations can be inserted using the \verb|equation| environment, which numbers them automatically. Equations can also be labeled and referenced using the \verb|\label| and \verb|\ref| commands.

% Adding an equation
\begin{equation}
    e^{i\pi}+1=0
    \label{eq:euler_identity}
\end{equation}

Referencing Equation \ref{eq:euler_identity}, also known as Euler's identity, is a great example of the power of LATEX's mathematical typesetting capabilities.

\section{Conclusion}
LATEX's versatility and customization options make it a popular choice for creating professional and aesthetically pleasing documents. With its precise typesetting, it is often used for academic and scientific writing. Now that you have learned the basics, it's time to explore and experiment with LATEX to create your own documents.
