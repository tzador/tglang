\documentclass{article} % defines the type of document to be created
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % specifies the encoding used in the document
\usepackage{amsmath} % allows for mathematical notations and equations
\title{A Latex Example} % sets the title of the document
\author{John Doe} % sets the name of the author
\date{\today} % sets the current date as the document date
\begin{document} % starts the document environment
\maketitle % creates the title page using the title, author, and date specified above
\section{Introduction} % creates a new section with the given name
This is a Latex example document. Latex is a typesetting language that is commonly used in academia for creating documents with mathematical notations and special formatting. % adds plain text to the document

In Latex, mathematical equations can easily be incorporated using the \$ symbol. For example, the equation $y = mx + b$ represents a linear function. % adds an equation to the document using the dollar sign notation

\subsection{Equation of a Circle} % creates a subsection within the current section
The standard equation for a circle is $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. % adds an equation with annotations

 \begin{equation*} % starts a numbered equation without labels
    \left\{
         % creates delimiters for a system of equations
            \begin{array}{lr} % specifies column alignment and number of columns
            x+y=4\\ % adds the first equation with a line break
            x-y=2 % adds the second equation
            \end{array}
    \right. % ends the delimiters
 \end{equation*} % ends the equation environment

The solution to this system of equations is $x = 3$ and $y = 1$. % adds plain text

\section{Conclusion} % creates another section
This concludes the Latex example document. % adds plain text
\end{document} % ends the document environment
