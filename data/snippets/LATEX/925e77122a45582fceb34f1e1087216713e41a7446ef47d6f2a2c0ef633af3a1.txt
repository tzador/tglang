\subsection{Quadratic Formula}
% subsection heading for quadratic formula
The quadratic formula is given by:
\begin{equation*}
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation*}
% This is the equation environment, which automatically numbers the equation. The asterisk after "equation" suppresses the numbering.
This formula is used to solve quadratic equations, where $a$,$b$, and $c$ are coefficients and $x$ is the variable.
% Explanation of the formula
\subsection{Euler's Formula}
% subsection heading for euler's formula
Euler's formula is a fundamental equation in mathematics which describes the relationship between complex numbers and trigonometric functions. It is given by:
\begin{equation*}
    e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)
\end{equation*}
% Again, the equation environment is used to display the formula. The "i" represents the imaginary unit and is denoted with a "dot" above it.
This formula is useful in various mathematical fields, such as signal processing and quantum mechanics.
