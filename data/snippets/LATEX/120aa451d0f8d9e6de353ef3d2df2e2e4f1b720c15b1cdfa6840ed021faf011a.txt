\section{Introduction} % Creates a section with title 'Introduction'
This is the introduction section of my first document. \label{sec:intro} % Labels the section with 'Introduction'

\subsection{Purpose} % Creates a subsection with title 'Purpose'
The purpose of this document is to provide a template for writing LaTeX documents.

\subsection{Scope} % Creates a subsection with title 'Scope'
The scope of this document includes a basic document structure and packages for mathematical equations and including figures.

\section{Document Structure} % Creates a section with title 'Document Structure'

This document consists of various sections and subsections, as shown in the table of contents. It also includes the title, author, and date on the first page.

\section{Mathematical Equations} % Creates a section with title 'Mathematical Equations'
There are many packages available for writing mathematical equations in LaTeX, but the most commonly used package is \textit{amsmath}. 

\subsection{Inline Equations} % Creates a subsection with title 'Inline Equations'
An inline equation can be written using the \verb|$| symbol, such as $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.

\subsection{Equation Environments} % Creates a subsection with title 'Equation Environments'
Equations can also be written in separate environments, such as the \verb|equation| environment which automatically numbers equations. For example:
\begin{equation}
y = \int_0^1 \mathrm{e}^x \, \mathrm{d}x
\end{equation}

There are also other environments such as \verb|align| and \verb|gather| which allow for multiple equations to be aligned or grouped together.

\section{Figures} % Creates a section with title 'Figures'
Figures can be included in LaTeX documents using the \verb|includegraphics| command. For example:
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering % Centers the figure
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{myimage.png} % Specifies the image to be included and its width
	\caption{Example Figure} % Adds a caption to the figure
	\label{fig:example} % Labels the figure for reference
\end{figure}

Multiple figures can also be included using the \verb|subfigure| package within a \verb|subfigure| environment:
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{myimage1.png}
		\caption{Figure 1}
		\label{fig:sub1}
	\end{subfigure}
	~
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{myimage2.png}
		\caption{Figure 2}
		\label{fig:sub2}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Multiple Figures}
	\label{fig:multiple}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion} % Creates a section with title 'Conclusion'
This document provides a basic template for writing LaTeX documents, including the necessary packages for mathematical equations and including figures. It can be customized and expanded upon for different purposes. Refer to Section \ref{sec:intro} for the introduction, Equation \ref{eq:myeq} for example equations, and Figures \ref{fig:example} and \ref{fig:multiple} for sample figures.
