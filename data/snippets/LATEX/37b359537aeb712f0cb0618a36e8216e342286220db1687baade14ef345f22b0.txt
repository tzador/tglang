\chapter{Introduction}
In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of code snippets and how they can be created in LATEX.

\section{What is a Code Snippet?}
A code snippet is a small section of code that is used to demonstrate a particular concept, algorithm, or programming language.

\section{Creating a Code Snippet in LATEX}
To create a code snippet in LATEX, we will use the \texttt{lstlisting} environment from the \texttt{listings} package. This allows us to include code in our document and format it according to our preferences.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=A Simple Python Code Snippet]
# This is a comment
print("Hello World!") # This prints out a simple message
x = 5 # This assigns the value 5 to the variable x
print("x =", x) # This prints out the value of x
\end{lstlisting}

We can specify the programming language in the optional argument of the \texttt{lstlisting} environment, which will adjust syntax highlighting and formatting accordingly. In this example, we have used Python.

\section{Adding Annotations}
In addition to the actual code, it is often useful to add annotations or descriptions to explain what each line of code does. We can do this by using the \texttt{caption} option within the \texttt{lstlisting} environment. Additionally, we can use the \texttt{text} option to include comments or explanations within the code itself.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption=A Java Code Snippet with Annotations]
// This is a comment
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!"); // This prints out a simple message
    int x = 5; // This assigns the value 5 to the variable x
    System.out.println("x = " + x); // This prints out the value of x
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we have learned how to create code snippets in LATEX using the \texttt{lstlisting} environment and how to add annotations and comments to our code. This will allow us to effectively demonstrate and explain various concepts and algorithms in our documents.
