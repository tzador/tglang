\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
% This is a section about introducing the document

In this document, we will discuss various methods for creating a complex code snippet in the programming language LATEX. As seen in Section \ref{sec:code}, there are multiple techniques that can be used to generate a code snippet.

\section{Generating the Code}
\label{sec:code}
% This section focuses on the coding process

To generate a code snippet in LATEX, we must first define the document class and any necessary packages. Then, we can start writing our code within the "document" environment, as shown below.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{document}

\section{Sample Code}
\label{sec:sample}

\begin{verbatim}
print("This is a sample code snippet in LATEX!")
\end{verbatim}

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

% Add a caption and label for referencing
\caption{Sample code snippet in LATEX}
\label{code:sample}

As seen in Code Snippet \ref{code:sample}, we use the "verbatim" environment to display our code exactly as it is written, without any formatting or interpretation. This is especially useful when we want to showcase a long and complex code snippet.

\section{Conclusion}
% This section summarizes the document

In conclusion, LATEX provides us with various tools and techniques for generating complex code snippets. By utilizing packages such as "graphicx" and adjusting the page margins using the "geometry" package, we can create professional-looking code snippets for our documents. Remember to always use the "verbatim" environment for longer snippets, and add proper labels and captions for referencing.
