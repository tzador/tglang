\section{Introduction} % Section heading
This is a long and complex LATEX code snippet.
It includes multiple packages and document elements.

\paragraph{Equations}
In this section, we will write some complex equations:

% This is a multiline equation with a label
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
f(x) = \int_0^x \frac{\sin x}{x}\, dx
\end{equation}

% This is a single line equation without a label
\begin{equation*}
g(x,y) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{lr}
        x^2+y^2 & : x=y \\
        0 & : x \neq y
    \end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}

% This is an align environment with multiple equations aligned at the & sign
\begin{align*}
h(x) &= e^{x^2}+x^3\\
f'(x) &= 2xe^{x^2}+3x^2
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Figures}
We can also include figures in our document:

% This includes an image called 'diagram' with a width of 0.5 times the text width
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{diagram}
\caption{A diagram illustrating some complex concept.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Tables}
Tables are another important element in a document:

% This creates a table with 3 columns and 3 rows
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Column A & Column B & Column C \\ \hline
    1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline
    4 & 5 & 6 \\ \hline
    7 & 8 & 9 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{A simple table with numbers.}
\end{table}

\section{Conclusion}
In this document, we have shown how to write complex equations, include figures and tables, and use different document elements in LATEX. This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the potential of LATEX in creating complex and professional-looking documents. With a little practice, you can master this powerful typesetting language and create your own complex code snippets.
