\section{Introduction} %declaring a new section
This is my first document in \LaTeX. %adding text to the section

\subsection{Motivation} %declaring a subsection
I decided to learn \LaTeX because it is a powerful typesetting tool. %adding text to the subsection

\section{Basic Formatting} %declaring a new section
In this section, we will learn how to format text and add mathematical formulas. %adding text to the section

\subsection{Text Formatting} %declaring a subsection
\textit{Italics}, \textbf{bold}, and \underline{underline} can be easily applied to text in \LaTeX. %using different formatting styles
You can also \textit{\textbf{combine}} them.

\subsection{Mathematical Formulas} %declaring a subsection
We can write mathematical formulas using the \texttt{equation} environment.

\begin{equation} %beginning the equation environment
    f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 %the mathematical formula
\end{equation} %ending the equation environment

We can also use the \texttt{align} environment to align multiple equations.

\begin{align} %beginning the align environment
    f(x) &= x^2 + 2x + 1 \\ %the first equation with alignment symbol &
    g(x) &= \frac{1}{x^2} %the second equation with alignment symbol &
\end{align} %ending the align environment

\section{Including Images} %declaring a new section
We can also include images in our document using the \texttt{figure} environment.

\begin{figure}[h] %beginning the figure environment with placement specifier h (here)
    \centering %centering the image
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{picture.jpg} %including the image with 50% of text width
    \caption{Example Picture} %adding a caption to the image
    \label{fig:example} %adding a label for referencing the image
\end{figure} %ending the figure environment

Figure \ref{fig:example} shows an example image included in the document.

\section{Conclusion} %declaring a new section
This concludes our first \LaTeX document. Happy typesetting! %adding text to the section
