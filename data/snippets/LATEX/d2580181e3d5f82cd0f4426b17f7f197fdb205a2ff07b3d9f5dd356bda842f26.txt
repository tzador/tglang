\documentclass{article} % This is the document class called 'article'

% Preamble
% The preamble contains global formatting settings, packages, and commands that will affect the whole document
% Packages are used to add additional functionalities to LaTeX

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % This package allows us to use special characters such as 'é' and 'ü'
\usepackage{amsmath, amssymb, amsthm} % These packages are for writing mathematical equations, symbols, and theorems
\usepackage{graphicx} % This package is for including images in the document

% Title and Author
\title{My First Document in \LaTeX} % This is the title of the document
\author{John Smith} % This is the author of the document
\date{\today} % This is the date that will appear in the document, \today will automatically insert the current date

% Begin document
\begin{document}

    \maketitle % This command will create the title and author section based on the information provided in the preamble
    
    % Abstract
    \begin{abstract} % This command creates the abstract section
        This is a sample abstract that explains the purpose of the document.
    \end{abstract}

    % Table of Contents
    \tableofcontents % This command creates the table of contents section based on the document's structure
    
    % Introduction
    \section{Introduction} % This command creates a new section titled "Introduction"
    This is my first document in \LaTeX. We will explore the various features and functionalities of this typesetting language.

    % Body

    \subsection{Formatting Text}
    \textbf{Bold text} is created using the \texttt{bold} command. % Use the \textbf{} command for bold text, and \texttt{} for typewriter font
    \textit{Italic text} is created using the \texttt{italic} command. % Use the \textit{} command for italic text
    \underline{Underlined text} is created using the \texttt{underline} command. % Use the \underline{} command for underlined text

    \subsection{Lists}
    \subsubsection{Unordered Lists}
    \begin{itemize} % Use the itemize environment for bulleted lists
        \item This is the first item
        \item This is the second item
        \item This is the third item
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Ordered Lists}
    \begin{enumerate} % Use the enumerate environment for numbered lists
        \item This is the first item
        \item This is the second item
        \item This is the third item
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsection{Mathematical Equations}
    We can write mathematical equations in \LaTeX using the \texttt{equation} environment:
    \begin{equation}
        f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4 % Use the equation environment for equations
    \end{equation}
    We can also use symbols and operations:
    \begin{equation}
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    \end{equation}

    \subsection{Images}
    Images can be included in the document using the \texttt{includegraphics} command:
    \begin{figure}[h] % The [h] parameter specifies the position of the figure - in this case, "here"
        \centering % This command centers the image
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} % Specify the width of the image and its file name
        \caption{This is a sample image.} % Add a caption to the image
        \label{fig:sampleimage} % Include a label for referencing the image in the document
    \end{figure}
