\section{Introduction}
This code snippet is a demonstration of various LaTeX features and functionalities. We will cover graphics, math equations, and hyperlinks.

\section{Graphics}
Here we will insert a figure using the \textit{graphicx} package. The figure will be in JPEG format and will be resized to 0.5 times the text width.

\begin{figure}[h] %Starts the figure environment, [h] specifies to place the figure 'here'
    \centering %Centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} %Inserts the image and sets its width
    \caption{Example image} %Sets the caption for the image
    \label{fig:example} %Sets a label for the image for referencing
\end{figure}

As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:example}, the image is resized to half of the text width and is centered.

\section{Math Equations}
We can write complex math equations using the \textit{amsmath} package. For example, we can write the quadratic formula as shown below:

\begin{equation} %Starts the equation environment
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} %Writes out the equation
\end{equation}

\section{Hyperlinks}
We can add hyperlinks to different parts of the document using the \textit{hyperref} package. For example, we can add a link to the Wikipedia page on LaTeX using the following code:

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX}{Click here to visit the Wikipedia page on LaTeX} %Creates a hyperlink with the specified text and URL
