\section{Introduction} % Starts a new section 
This code snippet demonstrates some of the commands and packages used in LATEX to create a complex document. The code is annotated to provide further explanation and guidance. % This is a comment within the document

\subsection{Equations} % Starts a subsection 
To start an equation, use the ``\textbackslash begin\{equation\}" command. % The ``equation" environment is used to typeset a single equation
\begin{equation} % Begins an equation
    f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x,t)dt % This is the actual equation, with the function f(x) being integrated over t from negative infinity to positive infinity
\end{equation} % Ends the equation

To align multiple equations, use the ``\textbackslash begin\{align\}" command. % The ``align" environment is used when multiple equations need to be aligned at a specific point
\begin{align} % Begins the align environment
    2x + 3y &= 5 \\ % The double backslash ``\\" indicates a line break within the align environment
    x - y &= 2
\end{align} % Ends the align environment

\subsection{Figures} % Starts a subsection 
To add a figure, use the ``\textbackslash includegraphics\{\}" command. % The ``includegraphics" command inserts an image into the document
\begin{figure}[h] % Begins a figure environment, with placement specifier ``h" for here
    \centering % Centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{image.png} % Specifies the width and filename of the image to be included
    \caption{This is a figure} % Adds a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:my_figure} % Labels the figure for referencing in the text
\end{figure} % Ends the figure environment

\section{Conclusion} % Starts a new section 
This code snippet only covers a small portion of LATEX's capabilities. With the use of additional packages and commands, LATEX can be used to create various types of complex documents such as reports, articles, and even books. % Conclusion statement
