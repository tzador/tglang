\section{Introduction} % Begin section
This is a complex LaTeX code snippet that showcases various features and functionalities of the language. In this snippet, we will be using the amsmath package for mathematical equations, as well as the graphicx package for including images. Let's get started! % Adding section text

\subsection{Mathematical Equations} % Begin subsection
To begin with, let's look at some simple equations using the align environment from the amsmath package:

\begin{align*}
    f(x) &= x^2 + 2x + 1 \\ % Adding first equation
    g(x) &= \sqrt{x^2 + 1} \\ % Adding second equation
    h(x) &= \frac{1}{2x + 1} % Adding third equation
\end{align*}

We can also use the equation environment for a single equation with a label:

\begin{equation} % Begin equation
    F(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(t) \,dt \label{eq:area} % Adding equation with label
\end{equation}

We can then refer to this equation by its label using the ref command: Equation \ref{eq:area}.

\subsection{Image Inclusion} % Begin subsection
Now, let's take a look at including images using the graphicx package. We can specify the width and height of the image as well as its placement using the following command:

\begin{center} % Begin centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, height=0.5\textheight, keepaspectratio]{image.jpg} % Adding image with specified width, height, and aspect ratio
\end{center} % End centering

We can also add captions and labels to images, making it easier to refer to them within our document:

\begin{figure}[h] % Begin figure with placement 'h' for here
    \centering % Centering image within figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{image2.jpg} % Adding image with specified width
    \caption{Example of an image with a caption.} % Adding caption
    \label{fig:image} % Adding label
\end{figure}

We can refer to this image by its label using the ref command: Figure \ref{fig:image}.
\end{document} % End document
