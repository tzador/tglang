\begin{abstract}
This is a long and complex code snippet written in LATEX, demonstrating its capabilities and features.
\end{abstract}

%introduction section
\section{Introduction}
LATEX is a powerful typesetting language commonly used for creating technical and scientific documents. It allows for easy formatting and customization of documents, making it a popular choice among researchers and academics.

%body section
\section{Body}
In this section, we will demonstrate some of the features of LATEX, such as including images, creating mathematical equations, and using different font styles.

%image inclusion
\subsection{Image Inclusion}
To include an image, use the \verb|includegraphics| command. For example, to include an image named \textit{example.jpg}, we would use the following code:

\begin{verbatim}
\includegraphics{example.jpg}
\end{verbatim}

The result would be:

\includegraphics{example.jpg}

%mathematical equations
\subsection{Mathematical Equations}
LATEX makes it easy to create professional-looking mathematical equations. For example, the Pythagorean theorem can be written as:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

The output would be:

\begin{equation}
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\end{equation}

%font styles
\subsection{Font Styles}
LATEX also allows for easy customization of font styles. For example, to write \textbf{bold} text, use the \verb|\textbf{}| command. To write \textit{italic} text, use the \verb|\textit{}| command. To write \underline{underlined} text, use the \verb|\underline{}| command. These commands can also be combined for more customized styles.

%conclusion section
\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, LATEX is a versatile and powerful language for creating complex and professional documents. It offers a wide range of features and customization options, making it a top choice for technical and scientific writing.
