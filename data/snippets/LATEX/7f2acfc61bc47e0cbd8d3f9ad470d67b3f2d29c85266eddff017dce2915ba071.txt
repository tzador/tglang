% Example latex code snippet

\documentclass{article} % Start with document class
\usepackage{amsmath} % Import the amsmath package for advanced math formatting
\begin{document} % Begin the document
\section{Introduction} % Start a section
This is an example of a simple latex code snippet. Here we introduce the \LaTeX{} environment and how to use it.

\subsection{Writing Simple Text} % Subsections are created using the subsection command
To write simple text in \LaTeX{}, we just type it as we would in any other document. It will automatically format the text, just like when we type in Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

\subsection{Math Formatting} % Another example subsection
One of the major benefits of using \LaTeX{} is its ability to format complex mathematical equations easily. We can use the commands provided by the amsmath package to create equations inline: $E=mc^2$, or in display mode:
\begin{equation}
    F=ma
\end{equation}
We can also use the align environment to align multiple equations, as shown below:
\begin{align}
    f(x) &= 2x^2 + 3x \\
    g(x) &= x^3 + 5x + 1
\end{align}

\subsection{Tables and Figures} % Yet another subsection
We can also create tables and add figures in our document using the table and figure environments respectively. Below is an example of a simple table:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Column 1 & Column 2 & Column 3 \\
        \hline
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        \hline
        4 & 5 & 6 \\
        \hline
        7 & 8 & 9 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Example table}
    \label{tab:example}
\end{table}

And here is an example of adding a figure:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example_image.png}
    \caption{Example figure}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion} % Final section
This concludes our example of a latex code snippet. We have covered the basics of text formatting, math formatting, and adding tables and figures in our document. With practice and further exploration, we can create professional-looking documents with ease using \LaTeX{}.
