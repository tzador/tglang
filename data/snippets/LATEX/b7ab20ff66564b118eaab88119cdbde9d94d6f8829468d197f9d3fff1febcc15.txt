\section{Introduction} % First section
This is a long and complex latex code snippet that showcases various features and packages offered by LaTeX. It includes the use of special characters like the degree symbol (°) and math symbols like the Greek letter alpha (α).

\section{Equations} % Second section
Here is an equation that utilizes the align environment from amsmath package:
\begin{align*}
    x &= a + b \\ % Use ampersand to align equations
    y &= c - d
\end{align*}

Here is another equation using the equation environment and the \texttt{sin} function from the amsmath package:
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}
\end{equation}

\section{Figures} % Third section
This section will showcase the use of the graphicx package to include images in the document. Here's an example of an image included in the document at a specific size and with a caption:
\begin{figure}[h] % Set placement of figure as here (h)
    \centering % Center the image
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image} % Include image and set its size to 50% of the text width
    \caption{Example Image} % Add a caption to the image
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

\section{References} % Fourth section
Lastly, this section will demonstrate the use of references in LaTeX. The image in the previous section can be referenced in this section with the \texttt{label} and \texttt{ref} commands:
\begin{quote}
    Refer to Figure \ref{fig:example} for an example image included in the document.
\end{quote}

\end{document} % End document
