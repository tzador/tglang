\documentclass{article} % Declares the document type

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % Allows the use of unicode characters

\usepackage{amsmath} % Enables advanced mathematical equations

\usepackage{graphicx} % Enables the use of graphics

\title{My Complex Document} % Sets the title of the document

\author{John Doe} % Sets the author of the document

\date{\today} % Sets the date of the document to today's date

\begin{document} % Starts the document

\maketitle % Prints the title, author, and date

\section{Introduction} % Creates a new section with the title "Introduction"

This is a complex document written in \LaTeX, a typesetting language that is widely used in academia and scientific research. It allows for precise control over formatting and is particularly useful for typesetting mathematical equations.

\section{Methodology} % Creates a new section with the title "Methodology"

In this section, we will discuss the methodology used in our research. First, we will define the variables of interest:

\begin{itemize} % Starts an unordered list
  \item $X_1$: Independent variable 1
  \item $X_2$: Independent variable 2
  \item $Y$: Dependent variable
\end{itemize}

Next, we will present our theoretical framework:

\begin{equation} % Starts an equation environment
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \epsilon
\end{equation} % Ends the equation environment

Where $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_2$ are the coefficients of our model and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

\section{Results} % Creates a new section with the title "Results"

After conducting our research, we obtained the following results:

\begin{figure}[h] % Starts a figure environment
  \centering % Centers the figure
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{results.png} % Inserts the image "results.png" with a width of 70% of the text width
  \caption{Results Graph} % Sets the caption of the figure
  \label{fig:results} % Sets a label for referencing the figure
\end{figure} % Ends the figure environment

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:results}, our results show a clear and significant relationship between $X_1$ and $Y$, while the relationship between $X_2$ and $Y$ is not as strong.

\section{Conclusion} % Creates a new section with the title "Conclusion"

In conclusion, \LaTeX is a powerful tool for typesetting complex documents, especially in the fields of academia and research. It allows for precise control over formatting and enables the use of advanced mathematical equations. As seen in our research, it is particularly useful for presenting and analyzing data. We hope that this document has provided a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of \LaTeX and has encouraged you to use it in your own work.
