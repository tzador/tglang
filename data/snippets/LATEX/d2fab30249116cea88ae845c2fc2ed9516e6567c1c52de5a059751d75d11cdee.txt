\section{Introduction}      % Creates a section with the given title

This is my first document written in \LaTeX.
\LaTeX{} is a typesetting program that is widely used for creating documents
with complex mathematical equations and symbols.

In this document, we will explore some of the basic functions and commands
used in \LaTeX{} and how they can be used to create beautiful documents.

\subsection{Equations}      % Creates a subsection with the given title

One of the main strengths of \LaTeX{} is its ability to typeset complex equations.
For example, we can write the famous Pythagorean theorem as:

\begin{equation}            % Starts an equation environment
    c^2 = a^2 + b^2         % Actual equation content
\end{equation}              % Ends the equation environment

\subsection{Symbols}       % Creates another subsection with the given title

Another great feature of \LaTeX{} is the ability to easily insert symbols and
special characters. For example, we can write the Greek letter $\alpha$ using
the command \verb|\alpha|.

\subsection{Tables}        % Creates another subsection with the given title

Tables are another useful tool in \LaTeX{} for organizing data and information.
We can create a simple table with the \texttt{tabular} environment:

% Creates a table with three columns and three rows
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
    \hline                      % Draws a horizontal line
    Fruit & Color & Price \\    % First row of the table
    \hline                      % Draws a horizontal line
    Apple & Red & \$1.99 \\     % Second row of the table
    \hline                      % Draws a horizontal line
    Banana & Yellow & \$1.49 \\ % Third row of the table
    \hline                      % Draws a horizontal line
\end{tabular}

\section{Conclusion}        % Creates another section with the given title

In conclusion, \LaTeX{} is a powerful and versatile typesetting program that
offers a wide range of features for creating professional-looking documents.

I hope this has given you some insight into the basics of \LaTeX{} and how it can
be used to create complex documents with ease.

Cheers to your future \LaTeX{} adventures!  % Some closing words
