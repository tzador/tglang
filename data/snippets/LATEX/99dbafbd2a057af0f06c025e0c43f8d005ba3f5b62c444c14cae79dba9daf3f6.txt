LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system for creating technical and scientific documents. It is based on the TeX typesetting language and offers a wide range of functions for formatting text, equations, and images. In this document, we will explore some of the basic features of LaTeX.

\subsection{Installing LaTeX} % Begins a subsection with the title "Installing LaTeX"
To use LaTeX, you need to have a LaTeX distribution installed on your computer. There are several distributions available, such as TeX Live, MiKTeX, and MacTeX. You can download and install the distribution of your choice from the internet. Once installed, you can use a LaTeX editor, such as TeXworks or TeXstudio, to create and compile your documents.

\subsection{Creating a Document} % Begins a subsection with the title "Creating a Document"
To create a LaTeX document, you need to start with a document class declaration and the necessary packages. The "article" class is commonly used for creating documents such as reports, articles, and assignments. The "12pt" option specifies the font size to be used. The "inputenc" and "fontenc" packages are used to ensure proper encoding of input and fonts. The "amsmath" package provides a wide range of mathematical symbols and formatting options. The "graphicx" package allows you to include images in your document. The "hyperref" package adds clickable links within the document, and the "listings" package allows you to include code snippets. The "color" package defines custom colors to be used in the document.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX] % Specifies the programming language to be used for the code snippet
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{listings}
\usepackage{color}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Adding Content} % Begins a subsection with the title "Adding Content"
Once the basic setup is complete, you can start adding content to your document. The \verb|\title| command is used to specify the document title, the \verb|\author| command is used to specify the author, and the \verb|\date| command is used to specify the date. The \verb|\maketitle| command then prints this information on the document.

To add a table of contents, you can use the \verb|\tableofcontents| command. This will generate a table of contents based on the document sections. To start a new page, you can use the \verb|\newpage| command.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\title{My Document}
\author{John Doe}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\tableofcontents
\newpage
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Creating Sections} % Begins a subsection with the title "Creating Sections"
To organize your document into sections, you can use the \verb|\section| command to create a new section. You can also use the \verb|\subsection| and \verb|\subsubsection| commands to create subsections and subsubsections, respectively.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\section{Introduction}
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system for creating technical and scientific documents.
\subsection{Installing LaTeX}
To use LaTeX, you need to have a LaTeX distribution installed on your computer.
\subsection{Creating a Document}
To create a LaTeX document, you need to start with a document class declaration and the necessary packages.
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Adding Content} % Begins a subsection with the title "Adding Content"
To add regular text in your document, you can simply type it in without any special commands. To format text as bold, use the \verb|\textbf| command and for italics, use the \verb|\textit| command. You can also use the \verb|\emph| command to emphasize text.

To add equations in your document, you can use the \verb|equation| environment. You can use the \verb|\label| command to add a label to an equation for referencing later. The \verb|\ref| command can then be used to refer to the labeled equation.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
To add regular text in your document, you can simply type it in without any special commands. To format text as bold, use the \textbf{command} and for italics, use the \textit{command}. You can also use the \emph{command} to emphasize text.

To add equations in your document, you can use the \begin{equation}environment\end{equation}. You can use the \label{command} to add a label to an equation for referencing later. The \ref{command} can then be used to refer to the labeled equation.
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Including Images} % Begins a subsection with the title "Including Images"
To include images in your document, you can use the \verb|\includegraphics| command and specify the path to the image. You can also specify the size and position of the image using the optional arguments in the command.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\begin{center} % Begins a centered environment for the image
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} % Specifies the image file and its width
\end{center} % Ends the centered environment
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Adding Code Snippets} % Begins a subsection with the title "Adding Code Snippets"
To include code snippets in your document, you can use the \verb|\begin{lstlisting}| environment and specify the programming language to be used in the optional arguments.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java] % Specifies the programming language to be used in the code snippet
// A simple Java program to print "Hello, World!"
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Adding Links} % Begins a subsection with the title "Adding Links"
To add clickable links in your document, you can use the \verb|\href| command and specify the link URL and display text as optional arguments.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
Click \href{https://www.example.com/}{here} to visit example website.
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Customizing Colors} % Begins a subsection with the title "Customizing Colors"
To define custom colors for use in the document, you can use the \verb|\definecolor| command and specify the color name, RGB value, and color model as optional arguments.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\definecolor{myblue}{RGB}{0, 0, 255} % Defines the color "myblue" with RGB value of (0, 0, 255)
\end{lstlisting}

\end{document} % Ends the document
