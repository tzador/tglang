\section{Introduction}

Hello, this is my first document in \LaTeX. 
I am using it to showcase my programming skills.

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to demonstrate how to write a basic document in \LaTeX.

\section{Body}
This is the body of the document. 
Here, I am going to explain some complex concepts in \LaTeX.

\subsection{Equations}
One of the most powerful features of \LaTeX is the ability to write complex mathematical equations. 
Here is an example:

\begin{equation}
    \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\end{equation}

This equation is known as the Gaussian integral and is used in many areas of mathematics and physics.

\subsection{Tables}
Creating tables in \LaTeX can be a bit tricky but the result is worth it. 
Here's a simple table:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} %specifying the number of columns and their alignment
        \hline %creates a horizontal line
        Country & Capital & Population (millions) \\ 
        \hline
        USA & Washington D.C. & 328.2 \\
        \hline
        Japan & Tokyo & 125.4 \\
        \hline
        Brazil & Bras√≠lia & 213.5 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Figures}
Including figures in \LaTeX documents is also possible. 
Here's an example:

\begin{figure}[h] %specifying the position of the figure (h = here)
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{lenna.png} %specifying the width and the filename of the image
    \caption{Example of an image in a \LaTeX document} %adding a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:lenna} %adding a label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}
That's it for this document. 
I hope this gave you a glimpse of the power of \LaTeX.
