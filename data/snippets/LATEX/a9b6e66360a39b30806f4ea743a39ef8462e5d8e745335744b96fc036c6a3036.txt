\documentclass{article}  % declares the document class as 'article'
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %allows for unicode input
\usepackage{amsmath} % allows for mathematical equations
\usepackage{graphicx} % allows for inclusion of graphics
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry} % sets the margin to 1 inch on all sides

\title{Complex Code Snippet with Annotations} % declares title of document

\author{John Doe} % declares author of document
\date{\today} % declares date of document

\begin{document} % begins the document
\maketitle % generates the title

\tableofcontents % generates table of contents
\newpage % starts a new page

\section{Introduction} % creates a new section titled 'Introduction'

This is a complex code snippet written in \LaTeX. % outputs a sentence in normal text

\subsection{Variables} % creates a subsection titled 'Variables'

Variables are used to store values, such as numbers or text. % outputs a sentence in normal text

\begin{verbatim} % starts the verbatim environment
    \newcommand{\myNum}{42}  % defines a new command '\myNum' with a value of 42
    \newcommand{\myStr}{Hello World} % defines a new command '\myStr' with a value of 'Hello World'
\end{verbatim} % ends the verbatim environment

Now we can use the variables in our document. For example, the value of \myNum{} is \myNum{} and the value of \myStr{} is \myStr{}. % outputs a sentence in normal text with the values of the variables inserted

\subsection{Mathematics} % creates a subsection titled 'Mathematics'

We can also use \LaTeX{} to write mathematical equations. For example, we can use the 'equation' environment to write the Pythagorean theorem as:

\begin{equation} % starts the equation environment
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2 % writes the equation
\end{equation} % ends the equation environment

In the equation above, $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent the sides of a right triangle. % outputs a sentence in normal text with inline math mode

\subsection{Graphics} % creates a subsection titled 'Graphics'

We can also include graphics in our document. For example, we can use the 'includegraphics' command to insert an image:

\begin{figure} % starts the figure environment
    \centering % centers the image
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} % inserts the image with a width of half the text width and named as 'image.jpg'
    \caption{An example image} % adds a caption to the image
    \label{fig:image} % adds a label for referencing the image
\end{figure} % ends the figure environment

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:image}, we can also add a caption and label to our images for easier referencing.

\subsection{Page Layout} % creates a subsection titled 'Page Layout'

We can also customize the layout of our document using the 'geometry' package. For example, we can set the margin to 1 inch on all sides using 'margin=1in' as an option:

\begin{verbatim} % starts the verbatim environment
    \usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry} % sets the margin to 1 inch on all sides
\end{verbatim} % ends the verbatim environment

This allows us to have more control over the appearance of our document.

\section{Conclusion} % creates a new section titled 'Conclusion'

In conclusion, \LaTeX{} is a powerful and versatile language for creating documents with complex formatting, including variables, mathematical equations, graphics, and customizable page layouts. It is widely used in the academic and scientific community, and is a valuable skill to have for creating professional documents. % outputs a paragraph in normal text
