    \item Superior typesetting and layout capabilities
    \item Simplified formatting options
    \item Automated cross-referencing and bibliography management
\end{itemize} % ends itemized list

\section{Usage} % creates section titled Usage
\label{sec:usage}

To create a \LaTeX{} document, you must first have a text editor and a \TeX{} distribution, such as TeX Live, installed on your computer. Once you have these tools, you can create a \LaTeX{} file (.tex) and use various commands and packages to structure and format your document.

To compile your \LaTeX{} document into a PDF, you will need to use a compiler, such as pdflatex. This process will convert your \LaTeX{} code into a readable and printable format.

\section{Conclusion} % creates section titled Conclusion
\label{sec:conclusion}

\LaTeX{} is a powerful and versatile tool for creating professional documents, particularly in the fields of mathematics, science, and academia. This code snippet only scratches the surface of what \LaTeX{} is capable of, and with some practice, you can create beautiful and well-formatted documents in no time.
