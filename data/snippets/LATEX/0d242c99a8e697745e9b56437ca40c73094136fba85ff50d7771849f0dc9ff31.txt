\section{Introduction} %Creating a section titled "Introduction"
This is the introduction section of my document. Here we will discuss some basic concepts and introduce the main topic.

\section{Main Topic} %Creating a section titled "Main Topic"
In this section, we will delve deeper into the main topic and explore various examples and applications.

\subsection{Definition of Main Topic} %Creating a subsection titled "Definition of Main Topic"
First, we will define the main topic and explain its significance and properties.

\begin{equation*} %Beginning a math environment with an unnumbered equation*
    f(x) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx %Writing an integral with limits from 0 to infinity
\end{equation*}

This is a complicated integral that may require special techniques to solve. We can also use the package \textit{Optional} to format it even further.

\begin{equation*}
    g(x) = \{ \begin{array}{cc} %Creating an array with two centered columns
             -x & \text{if } x < 0 \\ %Creating a condition and writing text with 'text' command
             x & \text{if } x \geq 0 %Creating a condition and writing text with 'text' command
            \end{array} %Ending the array
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Applications} %Creating a subsection titled "Applications"
Here we will discuss some real-world applications of the main topic.

\subsubsection{Application 1} %Creating a subsubsection titled "Application 1"
This is the first application of the main topic.

\begin{itemize} %Beginning an itemized list
    \item Example 1: We can use the main topic to solve problems in physics.
    \item Example 2: The main topic has applications in economics as well.
\end{itemize} %Ending the itemized list

\subsubsection{Application 2} %Creating a subsubsection titled "Application 2"
This is the second application of the main topic.

\begin{equation*}
    h(x) = \begin{cases} %Creating a case structure with 'cases' command
                x & \text{if } x \neq 0 \\ %Creating a condition and writing text with 'text' command
                1 & \text{if } x = 0 %Creating a condition and writing text with 'text' command
           \end{cases} %Ending the case structure
\end{equation*}

\section{Conclusion} %Creating a section titled "Conclusion"
In conclusion, we have explored the main topic and its definition, applications, and properties. We hope this document provides a useful introduction to this topic.
