\section{Introduction} % Create a section titled "Introduction"
This is an example of a complex code snippet in \LaTeX.

\begin{equation*} % Begin an unnumbered equation
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} % Write out the quadratic formula using appropriate mathematical symbols and formatting
\end{equation*}

Using the code snippet above, we can easily typeset equations in a neat and organized manner. Additionally, \LaTeX{} automatically handles spacing and alignment for us.

\subsection{Features} % Create a subsection titled "Features"
\begin{enumerate} % Begin an enumerated list of features
    \item Automatic numbering of equations, figures, and tables.
    \item Easy creation of mathematical symbols and special characters.
    \item Cross-referencing capabilities for equations, figures, and tables.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion} % Create a section titled "Conclusion"
In conclusion, \LaTeX{} is a powerful typesetting tool that is widely used in academia for its ability to handle complex equations and formulas. With a little bit of practice, anyone can create professional-looking documents in \LaTeX. Thank you for reading!
