% This is a complex code snippet in LATEX
\documentclass{article} % This defines the type of document we are creating, in this case it is an 'article'
\usepackage{amsmath} % This imports the 'amsmath' package which allows for advanced mathematical formatting
\begin{document} % This starts the document
    \begin{equation*} % This starts an unnumbered equation
        f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 5 % This is the equation we are defining
    \end{equation*} % This ends the unnumbered equation
    \section{Introduction} % This creates a new section titled 'Introduction'
    We can also write equations in a numbered format as shown below:
    \begin{equation} % This starts a numbered equation
        g(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n} % This is a more complex equation with a summation and fraction
    \end{equation} % This ends the numbered equation
    Another useful package for equations is 'amssymb' which provides additional mathematical symbols.
\end{document} % This ends the document
