\documentclass{article} %%% This defines the type of document - in this case, an article

\usepackage{amsmath} %%% This imports the AMS math package, which provides enhanced tools for mathematical formatting and symbols
\usepackage{graphicx} %%% This imports the graphicx package, which allows for the inclusion of images in the document
\usepackage{enumitem} %%% This imports the enumitem package, which allows for customization of lists

\title{A Latex Code Snippet} %%% This assigns a title to the document
\author{John Doe} %%% This assigns an author to the document
\date{\today} %%% This assigns the date of the document, using the current date

\begin{document} %%% This signifies the beginning of the actual document

  \maketitle %%% This command outputs the title, author, and date in the document
  
  \section{Introduction} %%% This command creates a section titled "Introduction"
  This is a demonstration of a code snippet in Latex. %%% This line is a normal text within the "Introduction" section
  We will use various packages to create a complex and formatted document. %%% This line is another normal text within the "Introduction" section
  
  \section{Equations} %%% This command creates a section titled "Equations"
  Latex provides a powerful and flexible tool for typesetting mathematical equations. %%% This line is a normal text within the "Equations" section
  Below is an example of the quadratic formula: %%% This line is another normal text within the "Equations" section
  
  \begin{equation} %%% This command creates an equation environment
  
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} %%% This is the actual quadratic formula, written in Latex syntax
    
  \end{equation} %%% This ends the equation environment
  
  \section{Lists} %%% This command creates a section titled "Lists"
  Latex supports different types of lists, such as numbered lists, bulleted lists, and customized lists. %%% This line is a normal text within the "Lists" section
  Below is an example of a bulleted list: %%% This line is another text within the "Lists" section
  
  \begin{itemize} %%% This command creates a bullet point list environment
  
    \item First item %%% This creates a bullet point with "First item" as the text
    \item Second item %%% This creates a bullet point with "Second item" as the text
    \item Third item %%% This creates a bullet point with "Third item" as the text
  
  \end{itemize} %%% This ends the bullet point list environment
  
  \section{Figures} %%% This command creates a section titled "Figures"
  Figures can be included in Latex documents by using the graphicx package. %%% This line is a normal text within the "Figures" section
  Below is an example of an inserted image: %%% This line is another normal text within the "Figures" section
  
  \begin{figure}[h] %%% This command creates a figure environment and specifies its positioning ("h" for "here")
    
    \centering %%% This command centers the figure
    
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example_image.jpg} %%% This command inserts the specified image with 50% of the document's text width
    
    \caption{Example Image} %%% This creates a caption for the image
    
    \label{fig:example} %%% This creates a label for the image, which can be referenced in the document
    
  \end{figure} %%% This ends the figure environment
  
  As shown in Figure \ref{fig:example}, images can be easily included and referenced in a Latex document.
  
  \section{Conclusion} %%% This command creates a section titled "Conclusion"
  This code snippet demonstrated some basic features of Latex, such as creating a title, sections, equations, lists, and figures.
  Latex offers many more advanced features and customization options, making it a powerful tool for creating professional and complex documents.
  
\end{document} %%% This signifies the end of the document
