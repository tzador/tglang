\documentclass{article} % this line specifies the document class
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % this line inputs the document with UTF-8 encoding
\usepackage{amsmath} % this line imports the AMS math package for mathematical formulas
\title{My Article} % this line specifies the title of the document
\author{John Doe} % this line specifies the author of the document
\date{\today} % this line specifies the date of the document, the current date can be generated with the \today command
\begin{document} % this command begins the document
\maketitle % this command generates the article title, author and date based on the information specified above
\section{Introduction} % this command creates a section with the title "Introduction"
This is a section about the basics of LATEX. % this line is the body of the section
\subsection{What is LATEX} % this command creates a subsection with the title "What is LATEX?"
LATEX is a typesetting language used for creating high-quality documents and is often used for scientific and technical writing. % this line is the body of the subsection
% this is a comment line, it will not be included in the final document
\subsection{Why use LATEX} % this command creates another subsection with the title "Why use LATEX?"
LATEX offers precise control over formatting and allows for the easy creation of complex structures such as tables, figures, and equations. It also has a vast library of pre-defined templates and packages to customize the document layout. % this line is the body of the subsection
\section{Basic Syntax} % this command creates another section with the title "Basic Syntax"
To create a document in LATEX, we start with the \textbackslash documentclass command followed by a set of brackets that specify the type of document we want to create. % this line is the body of the section
% this is another comment line
\subsection{Document Structure} % this command creates another subsection with the title "Document Structure"
The basic structure of a LATEX document consists of the preamble, which contains the document settings and packages, followed by the document body. % this line is the body of the subsection
\subsection{Document Settings} % this command creates another subsection with the title "Document Settings"
In the preamble, we can specify various settings for the document, such as the document class, font size, margins, and title. We can also import packages to add additional features, such as graphics or code listings. % this line is the body of the subsection
\subsection{Document Body} % this command creates another subsection with the title "Document Body"
The document body contains the actual content of the document, including sections, paragraphs, and formatting commands. We can also include mathematical equations using the \textbackslash equation or \textbackslash align environment, as shown below.  % this line is the body of the subsection
\begin{equation} % this command creates a single line mathematical equation
    \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
\end{equation}
\begin{align} % this command creates a multi-line aligned equation
    f(x) & = x^2 + 2x + 1 \\
         & = (x + 1)^2 
\end{align}
To compile our LATEX document into a PDF, we use a compiler such as \LaTeX{} or MiKTeX. % the \LaTeX command prints the LATEX logo and the \textbackslash compiler{} command includes the compiler name in italics
\end{document} % this command ends the document
