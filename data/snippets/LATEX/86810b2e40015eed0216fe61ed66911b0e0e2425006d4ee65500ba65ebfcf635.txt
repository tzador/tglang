\section{Introduction} %Creates a section titled "Introduction"

Here is an example of how to use mathematical equations in LATEX:

%Creates a new theorem with the custom style created earlier
\begin{theorem} 
Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables. Then, $E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$.
\end{theorem}

The above equation shows the linearity property of expected value.
