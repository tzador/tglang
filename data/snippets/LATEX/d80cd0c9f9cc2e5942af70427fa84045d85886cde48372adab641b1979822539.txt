\section{Definitions}
% Creates a new section titled 'Definitions'

\begin{definition}[Complex Number]
% Begins a new theorem environment for the definition of complex numbers
A complex number is a number of the form $a + bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit.
\end{definition}
% Ends the theorem environment for the definition of complex numbers

\begin{definition}[Differentiable Function]
An $n$-times differentiable function is a function $f$ that has derivatives up to order $n$, denoted as $f^{(n)}(x)$ .
\end{definition}

\section{Theorems}
% Creates a new section titled 'Theorems'

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]
If $f$ is a continuous function on $[a,b]$ and $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ on $[a,b]$, then $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
% Begins a new theorem environment for the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Let $x_0 \in [a,b]$ be fixed.
Define a function $g:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ by $g(x) = \int_{x_0}^{x} f(t) dt$.
% Adds some text to the theorem environment for the proof

By the definition of the integral, $g'(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in (a,b)$.
% Adds some text to the theorem environment for the proof

Since $f$ and $g$ are continuous on $[a,b]$, they are also continuous on $[a,x_0] \cup [x_0,b]$.
% Adds some text to the theorem environment for the proof

So by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point $c \in (a,b)$ such that $g'(c) = \frac{g(b) - g(a)}{b-a}$.
% Adds some text to the theorem environment for the proof

But by the definition of $g$, we have $g'(c) = f(c)$ and $g(b) - g(a) = \int_{x_0}^{b}f(t)dt - \int_{x_0}^{a}f(t)dt = \int_{a}^{b}f(t)dt$. Therefore, $f(c) = \frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(t)dt$.
% Adds some text to the theorem environment for the proof

By the Mean Value Theorem again, there exists a point $k \in [a,b]$ such that $f(k) = f(c)$ and $k \neq c$.
Therefore, $\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(t)dt = f(k)$.
% Adds some text to the theorem environment for the proof

Since $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a point $r \in [a,b]$ such that $f(r) = \frac{f(b) + f(a)}{2}$.
% Adds some text to the theorem environment for the proof

Therefore, $\int_{a}^{b}f(t)dt = 2(b-a)f(r) = F(b)-F(a)$, where $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$. Thus, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is now proven.
% Adds some text to the theorem environment for the proof
