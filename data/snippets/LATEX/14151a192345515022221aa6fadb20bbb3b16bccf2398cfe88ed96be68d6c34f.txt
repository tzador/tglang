This is the introduction of my document. Here, I will talk about the purpose of my document and provide some background information.

\subsection{Motivation} % Create subsection heading
\label{subsec:motivation} % Define label for cross-referencing
The motivation behind creating this document is to demonstrate the use of \LaTeX{} as a powerful typesetting tool.

\section{Methodology} % Create another section heading
\label{sec:method} % Define label for cross-referencing
In order to showcase the capabilities of \LaTeX{}, I will be using various packages such as \texttt{amsmath} for mathematical expressions and \texttt{graphicx} for including images.

\subsection{Equations} % Create another subsection heading
In this subsection, I will show how to write mathematical equations using \LaTeX{}. % No label needed for this subsection

We can write simple equations using the inline math mode,
\begin{equation*} % Start equation environment without numbering
    z = x + y
\end{equation*}

or we can use the equation environment for numbered equations,
\begin{equation} % Start equation environment with numbering
    F(x) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx
    \label{eq:integral} % Define label for this equation
\end{equation}
where $f(x)$ is a continuous function and $a$ and $b$ are the lower and upper limits respectively.

We can also use the align environment for multiple equations,
\begin{align} % Start align environment with numbering
    a + b &= c \\
    d + e &= f \\
    g + h &= i
\end{align}

\subsection{Images}
Now, let's include an image in our document.
\begin{figure}[h] % Start figure environment with placement specifier
    \centering % Align image to center
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/example-image.jpg} % Set width of image to be half of text width
    \caption{Example image} % Set caption label for this image
    \label{fig:example} % Define label for this figure
\end{figure}

As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:example}, we have successfully included an image in our document.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this document serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of \LaTeX{} as a typesetting tool. We have shown how to write equations, include images, and use different packages to enhance our document. This can be a powerful tool for creating professional and well-formatted documents.
