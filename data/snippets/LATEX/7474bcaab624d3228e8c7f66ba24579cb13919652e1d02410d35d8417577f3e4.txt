\documentclass{article}
% This is the document class we are using, which will determine the basic layout and format of our document.

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% This package allows us to use different character encodings in our document, including unicode characters.

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
% This package determines the font encoding used in our document, so that we can correctly display all characters in our chosen font.

\usepackage{amsmath}
% This package provides additional mathematical symbols and environments, making it easier for us to typeset equations in our document.

\usepackage{graphicx}
% This package allows us to include images in our document.

\usepackage{hyperref}
% This package adds hyperlinks to our document, allowing us to easily navigate between different sections and documents.

\usepackage{listings}
% This package enables us to include code snippets in our document, complete with syntax highlighting and line numbers.

\title{My Document}
\author{John Doe}
\date{\today}
% These commands define the title, author, and date of our document, which will be used in the title page and other places throughout the document.

\begin{document} % This command marks the beginning of our document and indicates that everything before this point is part of the preamble.
    
    \maketitle % This command generates the title page of our document, using the title, author, and date information from earlier.
    
    \tableofcontents % This command generates a table of contents based on the sections and subsections in our document.
    
    \section{Introduction}
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. % This is a standard section heading and the beginning of our document's content.
    
    \subsection{Background}
    Nunc sollicitudin scelerisque lacus vel commodo. % This is a subsection heading.
    
    \subsubsection{History}
    Aliquam erat volutpat. Sed eu sagittis magna, at gravida velit. % This is a subsubsection heading.
    
    \section{Methodology}
    Mauris risus orci, condimentum non risus non, convallis blandit massa.% This is another standard section heading and the beginning of a new section in our document.
    
    \begin{equation} % This starts a new equation environment where we can input mathematical equations.
    E = mc^2 % This is the famous equation from Einstein's theory of relativity.
    \end{equation} % This command ends the equation environment.
    
    \section{Results and Discussion}
    Fusce rhoncus sollicitudin ante nec posuere.% This is another standard section heading and the beginning of another section in our document.
    
    \begin{figure}[ht] % This starts a new figure environment where we can include images in our document. The [ht] option indicates that we want to place the figure here if possible, or at the top of the page otherwise.
        \centering % This command centers the figure.
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} % This command includes the image with a specified width, taking up half of the width of the page.
        \caption{Example Image} % This command adds a caption to our image.
        \label{fig:example} % This command allows us to refer to this figure later using \ref{fig:example}.
    \end{figure} % This command ends the figure environment.
    
    As we can see in \ref{fig:example}, our results are consistent with previous studies.
    
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Example Python code] % This starts a new code listing environment where we can include code snippets. The language option specifies the language of the code and the caption option adds a caption to our code listing.
    def fibonacci(n):
        # This function calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence.
        if n == 1 or n == 2:
            return 1
        else:
            return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    
    # Calculate the first 10 terms in the Fibonacci sequence.
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(fibonacci(i))
    \end{lstlisting} % This command ends the code listing environment.
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that lorem ipsum is a useful placeholder text.
    
\end{document} % This marks the end of our document.
