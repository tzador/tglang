\section{Introduction}  # starts a new section
In this code snippet, we will be exploring the use of various mathematical symbols and equations in \LaTeX.  # adds commentary
\section{Equations}  # starts a new section
\subsection{The Pythagorean Theorem}  # starts a subsection
The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle with sides $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$, the equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ holds true.  # adds commentary and equation
In \LaTeX, we can represent this equation as:
\begin{equation*}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2  # starts an unnumbered equation
\end{equation*}
\subsection{Euler's Identity}  # starts a subsection
Euler's Identity is a famous mathematical equation that combines three fundamental mathematical constants: $e$, $i$, and $\pi$. It is represented by the equation $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.  # adds commentary and equation
In \LaTeX, this equation can be written as:
\begin{equation}
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0  # starts a numbered equation
\end{equation}
\section{Symbols}  # starts a new section
\subsection{Set Notation}  # starts a subsection
In mathematics, sets are collections of elements. In \LaTeX, we can use various symbols to represent sets, such as:
\begin{itemize}  # starts a bullet point list
\item The natural numbers: $\mathbb{N}$  # adds commentary and symbol 
\item The integers: $\mathbb{Z}$  # adds commentary and symbol
\item The real numbers: $\mathbb{R}$  # adds commentary and symbol
\end{itemize}
