\end{abstract} %Ends the abstract section

\section{Introduction} %Begins the introduction section
In this section, we will introduce the topic of our document and provide some background information. 

\subsection{Motivation} %Begins the first subsection of the introduction section
The motivation for this document is to showcase the capabilities of LATEX for creating longer and more complex documents. LATEX is a versatile typesetting system that allows for professional-looking documents with advanced features such as mathematical equations, graphics, and cross-referencing.

\subsection{Objectives} %Begins the second subsection of the introduction section
Our main objectives for this document are to demonstrate the use of LATEX for creating a variety of content, including mathematical equations, figures, and tables. We also aim to showcase the use of different packages and formatting options to make the document visually appealing and easy to navigate.

\section{Methodology} %Begins the methodology section
In this section, we will discuss the methodology used in creating this document. This will include the use of specific packages, formatting options, and document structure.

\subsection{Packages} %Begins the first subsection of the methodology section
We have used several packages in this document to enhance its appearance and functionality. These include \textit{amsmath} for advanced mathematical equations, \textit{graphicx} for including graphics, \textit{setspace} for controlling line spacing, and \textit{hyperref} for enabling links within the document.

\subsection{Formatting Options} %Begins the second subsection of the methodology section
To make our document visually appealing and easy to read, we have used various formatting options such as font size, margins, line spacing, and link color. These are specified in the document class and specific packages used.

\subsection{Document Structure} %Begins the third subsection of the methodology section
We have organized our document into several sections, each with their own subsections. This allows for a clear and logical flow of information. We have also included the title page, abstract, and page numbering options discussed earlier.

\section{Results} %Begins the results section
In this section, we will present the results of our document, including the use of mathematical equations, figures, and tables. We will also discuss the overall appearance and readability of the document.

\subsection{Mathematical Equations} %Begins the first subsection of the results section
Here we will include some advanced mathematical equations using the \textit{amsmath} package.

\begin{equation} %Begins a numbered equation
    E = mc^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*} %Begins an unnumbered equation
    \Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Figures and Tables} %Begins the second subsection of the results section
In this subsection, we will demonstrate the use of figures and tables to present data and information.

\begin{figure}[H] %Specifies that the figure should be placed here (H) and starts the figure environment
    \centering %Centers the figure
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figure.png} %Includes the figure with a scaling factor of 0.5
    \caption{A sample figure} %Specifies the caption of the figure
    \label{fig:samplefigure} %Creates a label for referencing the figure later
\end{figure} %Ends the figure environment

Table \ref{tab:sampletable} shows a sample table with some data.

\begin{table}[H] %Specifies that the table should be placed here (H) and starts the table environment
    \centering %Centers the table
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|} %Specifies the columns and their alignment (center)
        \hline %Creates a horizontal line
        \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Score} \\ %Specifies the column headers with bold formatting
        \hline %Creates a horizontal line
        John & 90 \\ %Specifies the data in the first row
        \hline %Creates a horizontal line
        Amy & 85 \\ %Specifies the data in the second row
        \hline %Creates a horizontal line
    \end{tabular} %Ends the table
    \caption{A sample table} %Specifies the caption of the table
    \label{tab:sampletable} %Creates a label for referencing the table later
\end{table} %Ends the table environment

\section{Conclusion} %Begins the conclusion section
In this section, we will summarize the main points of our document and discuss its overall success in achieving our objectives.

\subsection{Summary} %Begins the first subsection of the conclusion section
