This is where we introduce the code snippet. \\ % This command creates a line break
Let's define the function $f(x) = 2x + 5$. \\
This function returns the result of $2x + 5$ for any input value of $x$. \\
\begin{equation*} % This command starts an equation environment without numbering the equation
   \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} % This is an integral followed by a square root
\end{equation*}
\section{Code} % This is another section heading
\begin{verbatim} % This is a verbatim environment which prints text exactly as it appears
for i = 0 to 10 do % This is a for loop in LATEX
   print("The value of i is " + i) % This prints the current value of i within the loop
end for % End of for loop
\end{verbatim}
Code snippet is now finished. % This is the end of the LATEX code
