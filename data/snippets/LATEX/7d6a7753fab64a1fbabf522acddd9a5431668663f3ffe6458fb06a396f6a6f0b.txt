\section{Introduction} % Starts the first section of the document

This code snippet is an example of a long and complex code written in \LaTeX{}. It showcases the different packages and features that can be used to create a professional-looking document.

\section{Mathematical Equations} % Starts a new section for mathematical equations

This section shows how mathematical equations can be written in \LaTeX{}. Below is an example of the famous Pythagorean theorem:

\begin{equation} % Starts an equation environment
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2 % Writes the equation in mathematical notation
\end{equation} % Ends the equation environment

\section{Figures} % Starts a new section for including figures

Figures are essential to make a document more visually appealing. This section demonstrates how to include a figure in a \LaTeX{} document.

\begin{figure}[h] % Starts a figure environment with the 'h' parameter to position the figure here
    \centering % Centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{example-image} % Inserts the figure named 'example-image' with 50% of the document's width
    \caption{This is a sample figure.} % Writes a caption for the figure
    \label{fig:sample} % Sets a label for referencing the figure in the text
\end{figure} % Ends the figure environment

Figure \ref{fig:sample} shows an example of a figure. Figures can be referenced and automatically numbered by using the \texttt{label} and \texttt{ref} commands.

\section{Tables} % Starts a new section for tables

Tables are a useful tool for presenting data in a structured format. The code below creates a simple table with three columns and three rows.

\begin{tabular}{ c|c|c } % Starts a table environment with three columns and vertical lines between them
    \hline % Inserts a horizontal line
    Column 1 & Column 2 & Column 3 \\ % Writes the column headers separated by '&' symbols
    \hline % Inserts a horizontal line
    Row 1, Column 1 & Row 1, Column 2 & Row 1, Column 3 \\ % Writes the data for the first row
    \hline % Inserts a horizontal line
    Row 2, Column 1 & Row 2, Column 2 & Row 2, Column 3 \\ % Writes the data for the second row
    \hline % Inserts a horizontal line
    Row 3, Column 1 & Row 3, Column 2 & Row 3, Column 3 \\ % Writes the data for the third row
    \hline % Inserts a horizontal line
\end{tabular} % Ends the table environment

\section{Conclusion} % Starts the final section of the document

This code snippet covered some of the fundamental features of \LaTeX{}, including equations, figures, and tables. It also showed how to use packages to enhance the appearance of the document. \LaTeX{} is a powerful tool for creating professional-looking documents with complex equations and data.
