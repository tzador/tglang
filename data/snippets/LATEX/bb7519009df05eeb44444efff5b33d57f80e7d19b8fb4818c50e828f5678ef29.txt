%Define a theorem
\begin{theorem}
Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $X$ is compact.
    \item Every net in $X$ has a convergent subnet.
    \item Every filter on $X$ has a convergent refinement.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

%Proof environment
\begin{proof}
%Use stepwise reasoning
$(1 \Rightarrow 2)$ Suppose $X$ is compact. Then by definition, every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover. Let $N$ be a net in $X$. Consider the set $A = \{N_{\alpha} : \alpha \in I\}$, where $N_{\alpha}$ is a subnet of $N$ and $I$ is the directed set indexing the net. Since $N$ is a net, any element $x \in X$ has a directed set $\{N_{\alpha} : \alpha \geq \beta_x\}$ such that $x \in N_{\alpha}$ for all $\alpha \geq \beta_x$. By the convergence of subnets, $\{x\}$ is a subnet of $A$ and thus in the finite subcover. Therefore, there exists a convergence subnet of $N$.

$(2 \Rightarrow 3)$ Suppose every net in $X$ has a convergent subnet. Now, let $\mathcal{F}$ be a filter on $X$. Pick a subnet $N$ of the filter basis $\mathcal{F}$, and by assumption, $N$ converges to some point $x \in X$. This means that every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains a point $N_{\alpha}$, where $N_{\alpha} \in N \subset \mathcal{F}$. Therefore, $\mathcal{F}$ converges to $x$ and is a refinement of $N$.

$(3 \Rightarrow 1)$ Suppose every filter on $X$ has a convergent refinement. Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $X$. Define a filter $\mathcal{F}$ by $\mathcal{F} =\{U : U \in \mathcal{U}\}$, and by assumption, $\mathcal{F}$ has a convergent refinement $\mathcal{F}_{c}$ to some point $x \in X$. Then, there exists a neighborhood $U \in \mathcal{U}$ such that $x \in U$. Therefore, $x$ is contained in at least one element of the open cover and is thus compact.
