This is a complex Latex code snippet that showcases different aspects of the language.

\noindent % indent the following text
\subsection{Formatting} % add a subsection titled "Formatting"
Latex allows for easy formatting of text, such as making it \textbf{bold} or \textit{italic}.

\subsection{Lists} % add another subsection titled "Lists"
Latex also allows for the creation of numbered lists:

\begin{enumerate} % start a numbered list
\item First item
\item Second item
\item Third item
\end{enumerate} % end the numbered list
and bullet point lists:
\begin{itemize} % start a bullet point list
\item First item
\item Second item
\item Third item
\end{itemize} % end the bullet point list

\subsection{Equations} % add another subsection titled "Equations"
Latex is known for its ability to create complex equations, such as the ever famous $E=mc^2$.

\subsection{Figures and Tables} % add another subsection titled "Figures and Tables"
Latex can also handle inserting figures and tables into the document:

\begin{figure}[h] % start a figure environment
  \centering % center the figure
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{image.jpg} % insert image with 50% of the line width
  \caption{This is a caption for the image} % add a caption to the figure
  \label{fig:myimage} % label the figure for referencing in text
\end{figure} % end the figure environment

Latex can also create tables with specified columns and rows:

\begin{table}[h] % start a table environment
  \centering % center the table
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} % specify 3 columns with centered alignment and vertical lines in between
    \hline % add a horizontal line
    Column 1 & Column 2 & Column 3 \\ 
    \hline
    Row 1 & Data 1 & Data 2 \\
    \hline
    Row 2 & Data 3 & Data 4 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular} % end the table
  \caption{This is a caption for the table} % add a caption to the table
  \label{tab:mytable} % label the table for referencing in text
\end{table} % end the table environment

\subsection{Adding Code} % add another subsection titled "Adding Code"
Latex also has the ability to include code snippets within the document, with proper formatting and syntax highlighting:

\begin{verbatim} % start a verbatim environment for displaying code
  for i in range(1,10): % insert a for loop in Python code
      print(i) % print the value of i
\end{verbatim} % end the verbatim environment

\section{Conclusion} % create a new section titled "Conclusion"
This complex Latex code snippet showcases just a few of the many features that make Latex a powerful language for document formatting. With its ability to handle text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as its versatility in formatting, Latex is a popular choice for academic and technical documents.
