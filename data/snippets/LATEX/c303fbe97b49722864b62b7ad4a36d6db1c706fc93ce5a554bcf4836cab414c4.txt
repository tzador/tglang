\section{Introduction}

This is an example of a complex code snippet in \LaTeX. It includes various packages, a title, author, and date, as well as a section and text content.

\section{Equations and Symbols}

In this section, we will explore how to write equations and use mathematical symbols in \LaTeX.

The following equation is an example of the famous Pythagorean theorem:

\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}

We can also write fractions using the \texttt{frac} command:

\begin{equation}
\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}

To use symbols, we can use the \texttt{amssymb} package. For example, we can write the set of natural numbers using the \texttt{mathbb} command:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}
\end{equation}

\section{Referencing}

To reference equations, sections, and figures within our document, we can use the \texttt{hyperref} package. For example, to reference the Pythagorean theorem equation, we can use the label \texttt{eq:pythagorean} and then refer to it using the \texttt{ref} command:

Equation \ref{eq:pythagorean} is an example of the Pythagorean theorem.

\section{Figures}

We can also include figures in our document using the \texttt{graphicx} package. Here is an example of how to insert an image:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{latex-image.png}
\caption{A sample LaTeX image.}
\label{fig:latex}
\end{figure}

We can also refer to figures using the \texttt{ref} command. Figure \ref{fig:latex} is an example of a LaTeX image.

\section{Conclusion}

This concludes our complex code snippet example in \LaTeX. We have covered how to use packages, write equations and symbols, reference within our document, and include figures. Happy coding!
