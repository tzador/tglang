    In order to generate a code snippet in LATEX, the following steps are required: %Text for the methodology section
    \begin{enumerate} %Starts a numbered list using the enumerate package
        \item Begin by defining the document class using the \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass} command.
        \item Import any necessary packages using the \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage} command.
        \item Define the title, author, and date using the appropriate commands.
        \item Start the document using the \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{document\}} command.
        \item Add any desired sections and subsections to the document using the \texttt{\textbackslash section} and \texttt{\textbackslash subsection} commands.
        \item Use the \texttt{\textbackslash label} command to create references for sections, subsections, and other elements in the document.
        \item Add content to the document, including text, equations, and graphics.
        \item End the document using the \texttt{\textbackslash end\{document\}} command.
    \end{enumerate}
    Follow these steps carefully to ensure your code snippet is properly formatted and annotated. %Additional text for the methodology section
