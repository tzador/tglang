\section{Introduction}
This is an introduction to our document.

\begin{theorem}
Pythagoras' theorem states that for a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the sides of the right triangle, with $c$ being the hypotenuse. Then,
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
$$\implies a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = 0$$
$$\implies (a+b-c)(a-b+c) = 0$$
$$\implies a+b-c = 0 \text{ or } a-b+c = 0$$
Since we know $c$ is the longest side, $a+b-c = 0$ is not possible. Therefore, $a-b+c = 0$ and we can rewrite it as $a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2}$. Substituting this into our original equation gives us:
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
$$\implies (\sqrt{c^2 - b^2})^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
$$\implies c^2 - b^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
$$\implies c^2 = c^2$$
Hence, Pythagoras' theorem is proved.
\end{proof}
