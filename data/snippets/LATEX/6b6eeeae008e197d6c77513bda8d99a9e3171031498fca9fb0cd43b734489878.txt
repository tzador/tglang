This is my abstract for a very complex LaTex document. It will contain all sorts of equations and symbols, as well as images and hyperlinks. Exciting stuff, I know.

\section{Introduction}
Welcome to my complex LaTex document. In this section, we will discuss the purpose of this document and its structure. This is an example section, so feel free to delete or modify it as you see fit.

\subsection{Subsection 1}
In this subsection, we will discuss some background information related to our topic. Let's start with some basic equations:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pythagorean}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:pythagorean} is known as the Pythagorean Theorem. It's a fundamental equation in mathematics.

\subsection{Subsection 2}
In this subsection, we will discuss some more advanced concepts related to our topic. Let's start by introducing some symbols:

\begin{align*}
&\rho \hspace{3mm} \text{is the density of the material} \\
&\sigma \hspace{3mm} \text{is the stress applied to the material} \\
&\epsilon \hspace{3mm} \text{is the strain experienced by the material}
\end{align*}

We can also insert images in our LaTex document using the \verb|includegraphics| command:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image1.png}
\caption{This is a sample image.}
\label{fig:image1}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:image1} shows a sample image that has been inserted using the \verb|includegraphics| command. 

In addition to equations and images, we can also include links in our document using the \verb|url| command:
