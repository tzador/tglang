\section{Introduction} % creates a section titled "Introduction"
This is a sample document written in \LaTeX. It will showcase some of the basic features and capabilities of the language.

\subsection{Background} % creates a subsection titled "Background"
\LaTeX{} is a typesetting language used for creating documents with complex formatting, such as scientific or technical papers. It is based on the \TeX{} typesetting system created by Donald Knuth.

\section{Formatting} % creates a new section titled "Formatting"
In \LaTeX{}, formatting is done by using specific commands and environments. For example, to create a bolded text, we can use the \verb|\textbf{}| command: \textbf{This text will be bolded.}

\subsection*{Lists} % creates a subsection titled "Lists" without a number
Lists can be created in \LaTeX{} using the \verb|itemize| or \verb|enumerate| environment. For example, to create a bulleted list, we can use the \verb|itemize| environment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Item 1
    \item Item 2
    \item Item 3
\end{itemize}

Lists can also be nested by using the same environments within each other. For example:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First item
    \item Second item
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Subitem 1
        \item Subitem 2
        \item Subitem 3
    \end{itemize}
    \item Third item
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Tables} % creates a subsection titled "Tables" without a number
Tables can be created in \LaTeX{} using the {\em tabular} environment. Here is an example of a simple table:

\begin{table}[h] % specifies table placement to be "here"
    \centering % centers the table
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|r|} % column formatting, "l" stands for left, "c" for center, and "r" for right alignment
        \hline % horizontal line
        \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Age} & \textbf{Occupation} \\ % column headers
        \hline
        John & 25 & Engineer \\ 
        \hline
        Bob & 32 & Teacher \\
        \hline
        Sarah & 28 & Artist \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Example of a table} % adds a caption to the table
    \label{tab:example} % adds a label for referencing in the text
\end{table}

Notice how the table is automatically numbered and labeled based on the order of appearance.

\subsection*{Graphics} % creates a subsection titled "Graphics" without a number
Images can be included in \LaTeX{} using the \verb|\includegraphics{}| command. Here is an example of how we can include an image into our document:

\begin{figure}[h] % specifies figure placement to be "here"
    \centering % centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} % specifies the width of the image to be half of the text width
    \caption{Example of an image} % adds a caption to the image
    \label{fig:example} % adds a label for referencing in the text
\end{figure}

\section{Mathematics} % creates a new section titled "Mathematics"
As mentioned earlier, \LaTeX{} is commonly used for typesetting complex math equations. It provides a multitude of mathematical symbols and operators. Here is an example of a simple equation:

\begin{equation}
    \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a) % example of an integral equation
    \label{eq:example} % adds a label for referencing in the text
\end{equation}

Equations can also be numbered for referencing, as shown in Equation \ref{eq:example}.

\subsection*{Aligning equations} % creates a subsection titled "Aligning equations" without a number
To align equations, we can use the \verb|align| environment. Here is an example:

\begin{align*} % no equation numbering
    x &= 2y + 3 \\
    5x + 2y &= 10
\end{align*}

We can also include multiple equations in one line, as long as we use the \verb|\nonumber| command for the equations we do not want numbered:

\begin{align} % equation numbering for the last equation only
    x &= 2y + 3 \nonumber \\
    5x + 2y &= 10 \nonumber \\
    3x - y &= 2
    \label{eq:system}
\end{align}

\section{References} % creates a new section titled "References"
To reference elements, such as figures or tables, we can use the \verb|\ref{}| command. For example, referring to Table \ref{tab:example} or Figure \ref{fig:example}.

\subsection*{Citations} % creates a new subsection titled "Citations" without a number
To cite sources in our document, we can use the \verb|\cite{}| command. Here is an example:

According to \cite{smith2010}, the use of \LaTeX{} is increasing in the scientific community.

\begin{thebibliography}{9} % specifies bibliography style and maximum number of references
\bibitem{smith2010} % label for referencing in the text
    Smith, J. (2010). \textit{The Rise in Usage of LaTeX in the Scientific Community}. Journal of Science and Technology, 10(2), 45-50.
\end{thebibliography}
