\documentclass{article} 
% This is a document class for creating articles in LaTeX 
 
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} 
% This package allows for unicode input for foreign characters 
 
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} 
% This package allows for proper font encoding for special characters 
 
\usepackage{amsmath} 
% This package provides additional math symbols and environments 
 
\usepackage{graphicx} 
% This package allows for including images in the document 
 
\title{An Example Article} 
% This sets the title for the document 
 
\author{John Doe} 
% This sets the author name 
 
\date{\today} 
% This sets the date to be today's date 
 
\begin{document} 
 
\maketitle 
% This inserts the title, author, and date at the top of the document 
 
\section{Introduction} 
% This creates a new section titled "Introduction" 
 
This is a sample article written in \LaTeX. 
% This is a regular text in the document 
% Note the use of \LaTeX to display the LaTeX logo 
 
\section{Equations} 
 
We can write mathematical equations in-line by using the \$ symbol. 
% This is a comment, not displayed in the document 
 
For example, the quadratic formula can be written like this: 
% This is also a comment 
 
$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $ 
% This is the actual equation, note the use of math symbols and commands 
 
Or we can write equations in a separate block by using \texttt{equation} environment. 
% This is a comment, not displayed in the document 
 
\begin{equation} 
    f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 
\end{equation} 
% This is the equation displayed in a separate block 
 
We can also use the \texttt{align} environment to align multiple equations with a specific symbol using the \texttt{\&} sign. 
% This is a comment, not displayed in the document 
 
\begin{align} 
    f(x) &= (x + 1)^2 \\ 
    &= x^2 + 2x + 1 \nonumber \\ 
    &= \sqrt{(x + 1)^4} \nonumber \\ 
    &= (x + 1)^2 \nonumber 
\end{align} 
 
\section{Figures} 
 
We can include figures in our document by using the \texttt{figure} environment. 
% This is a comment, not displayed in the document 
 
\begin{figure}[h] 
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{example-image} 
    \caption{An Example Image} 
    % This sets the caption for the figure 
    \label{fig:example} 
    % This sets a label for referencing the figure later in the document 
\end{figure} 
 
We can then refer to the figure in our text using the label we set earlier, like this: 
% This is a comment, not displayed in the document 
 
Figure \ref{fig:example} shows an example image. 
 
\end{document}
