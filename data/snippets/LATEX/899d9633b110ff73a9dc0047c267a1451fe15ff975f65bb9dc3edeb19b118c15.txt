\section{Introduction}

This is a complex code snippet in \LaTeX. It includes various packages and commands to format and customize the document. Let's explore each line of the code.

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}
\end{verbatim}
This line specifies the document class as "article" with a font size of 12pt and paper size of A4. You can change these values according to your preference.

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\end{verbatim}
This package specifies the encoding of the document as UTF-8, allowing the use of characters from different languages.

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\end{verbatim}
This package specifies the font encoding as T1, which allows for better font appearance and support for symbols and foreign characters.

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\end{verbatim}
This package specifies the language of the document as English. You can change this to your preferred language.

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\end{verbatim}
This package allows the use of mathematical equations and symbols in the document.

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\end{verbatim}
This package allows the inclusion of images in the document.

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[margin=2.5cm]{geometry}
\end{verbatim}
This package sets the page margins to 2.5cm on all sides. You can change this value according to your desired margins.

\begin{verbatim}
\title{Complex Code Snippet in \LaTeX}
\end{verbatim}
This line defines the title of the document.

\begin{verbatim}
\author{Your Name}
\end{verbatim}
This line defines the author of the document. Replace "Your Name" with your actual name.

\begin{verbatim}
\date{\today}
\end{verbatim}
This line sets the date of the document to today's date. You can change this to a specific date or remove it altogether to exclude the date from the document.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{document}
\end{verbatim}
This command tells \LaTeX to start rendering the document. Everything after this command is considered the body of the document.

\begin{verbatim}
\maketitle
\end{verbatim}
This command generates the title and author specified earlier.

\begin{verbatim}
\tableofcontents
\end{verbatim}
This command generates a table of contents based on the sections and subsections in the document. You may need to compile the document twice for the table of contents to appear.

\begin{verbatim}
\newpage
\end{verbatim}
This command adds a new page to the document.

\begin{verbatim}
\section{Introduction}
\end{verbatim}
This command creates a new section in the document with the title "Introduction". You can add more sections and subsections as needed.

\begin{verbatim}
This is a complex code snippet in \LaTeX. It includes various packages and commands to format and customize the document. Let's explore each line of the code.
\end{verbatim}
This is the actual content of the document. You can add text, equations, images, and other formatting to your document.
