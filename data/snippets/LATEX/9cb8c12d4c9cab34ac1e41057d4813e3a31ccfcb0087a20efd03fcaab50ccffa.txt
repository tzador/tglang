\title{My Complex LaTeX Document}
\author{John Doe}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle % Creating the title page

\tableofcontents % Adding a table of contents

\section{Introduction} % Starting a new section
This is a test document to demonstrate the complexity of LaTeX code.

\section{Equations} % Adding another section
LaTeX is great for typesetting complex equations, such as the famous Euler's formula:
\begin{equation} % Starting a math equation
    e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x) % Writing out the equation
\end{equation} % Ending the math equation

We can also combine multiple equations using the align environment:
\begin{align}
    a^2 + b^2 &= c^2 \\ % Using the & symbol to align equations
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot F &= 0
\end{align}

\section{Figures} % Adding another section
Images and figures can easily be included in a LaTeX document, like this cute cat picture:
\begin{figure}[h] % Adding placement specifier for the figure
    \centering % Centering the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{cat.jpg} % Including the image with a specified width
    \caption{My cat, Fluffy} % Adding a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:cat} % Adding a label for referencing in the text
\end{figure}

\section{Hyperlinks} % Adding another section
We can also add hyperlinks in our document using the hyperref package. Here's a link to the Overleaf website \href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{Overleaf} % Using the \href command to create a clickable link with the specified text and URL.

\section{Conclusion} % Adding another section
In conclusion, LaTeX is a powerful and versatile tool for creating complex documents such as scientific papers, reports, and presentations. It may have a steep learning curve, but it is definitely worth it for its beautiful output and advanced typesetting capabilities.
