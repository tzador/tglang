% This is a complex code snippet in LATEX
\documentclass{article} %documentclass defines the type of document we are creating
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %inputenc is used to set the input character encoding
\usepackage{amsmath} %amsmath provides additional math environments and symbols

%preparing document information
\title{Creating a Code Snippet in LATEX}
\author{John Smith}
\date{\today} % \today automatically inserts the current date

\begin{document} %starts the document
\maketitle %prints the title, author, and date defined above

\section{Introduction} %starts a new section with heading "Introduction"
Here is a code snippet in LATEX:

\begin{verbatim} %verbatim environment used to display code as is without any formatting
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
    \usepackage{amsmath}

    \title{Creating a Code Snippet in LATEX}
    \author{John Smith}
    \date{\today}
\end{verbatim}

In the code above, we have defined the document class as "article" and specified the input character encoding as UTF-8. We have also included the "amsmath" package to access additional math symbols and environments.

Next, we have prepared document information such as the title, author, and date using the \verb|\title|, \verb|\author|, and \verb|\date| commands.

The document environment has been started and the \verb|\maketitle| command is used to print the title, author, and date defined above.

The \verb|\section| command is used to create a new section with the heading "Introduction".

The actual code snippet is wrapped within the \verb|verbatim| environment to display it as is without any formatting.

\section{Conclusion}
In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a code snippet in LATEX using the \verb|verbatim| environment. We have also seen how to define document information and title in LATEX.
