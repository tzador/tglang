% This is a complex LATEX code snippet
\documentclass{article} % Defines the document class as 'article'

% Packages to be used
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % Allows the use of Unicode characters

% Define new command for easier typing
\newcommand{\mvec}{\mathbf} % Defines a new command for writing bold vectors

\begin{document} % Begins the document

\title{Complex LATEX code snippet} % Adds a title to the document
\author{John Doe} % Adds an author
\date{\today} % Adds current date as the document's date

\maketitle % Generates title, author, and date

\begin{abstract} % Starts the abstract section
This is a complex code snippet written in LATEX. It demonstrates the use of various packages, commands, and structures to create a professional document. % Adds the abstract content
\end{abstract} % Ends the abstract section

\section{Introduction} % Starts a new section titled 'Introduction'
LATEX is a popular typesetting system used for creating high-quality documents, such as academic papers, reports, and books. It uses a combination of text and markup commands to structure and format the document. % Adds content to the section

\section{Equations} % Starts a new section titled 'Equations'
LATEX has powerful features for writing mathematical equations, including the use of special symbols and formatting. For instance, we can write a vector equation as follows:
\begin{equation} % Starts an equation environment
    \mvec{F} = m\mvec{a} % Adds the equation content
\end{equation} % Ends the equation environment
This equation shows Newton's second law, where $\mvec{F}$ represents the force, $m$ represents the mass, and $\mvec{a}$ represents the acceleration.

\section{Figures} % Starts a new section titled 'Figures'
LATEX allows for the insertion of high-quality graphics and figures into the document. We can include a figure as follows:
\begin{figure}[h] % Starts a figure environment with the 'h' option for positioning at current location
    \centering % Centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image} % Inserts the image with 50% of the text width
    \caption{Example figure} % Adds a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:example} % Adds a label for referencing the figure
\end{figure} % Ends the figure environment
Figure \ref{fig:example} shows an example image that has been inserted into the document.

\section{Tables} % Starts a new section titled 'Tables'
LATEX also has features for creating tables, which are useful for organizing data and information in a structured format. We can define a table as follows:
\begin{table}[h] % Starts a table environment with the 'h' option for positioning at current location
    \centering % Centers the table
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c} % Defines the columns and their alignment
        \hline % Adds a horizontal line
        \textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} & \textbf{Column 3} \\ % Adds the column headers
        \hline % Adds a horizontal line
        Value 1 & 10 & A \\ % Adds data in the first row
        Value 2 & 20 & B \\ % Adds data in the second row
        Value 3 & 30 & C \\ % Adds data in the third row
        \hline % Adds a horizontal line
    \end{tabular} % Ends the table environment
    \caption{Example table} % Adds a caption to the table
    \label{tab:example} % Adds a label for referencing the table
\end{table} % Ends the table environment
Table \ref{tab:example} shows an example table that has been created in the document.

\section{Conclusion} % Starts a new section titled 'Conclusion'
In conclusion, LATEX offers a variety of powerful features for creating professional documents. This code snippet has demonstrated some of these features, including equations, figures, and tables. With some practice, one can create complex and visually appealing documents using LATEX. % Adds content to the section
