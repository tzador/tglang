% This is a commented line in LaTeX
\documentclass{article} % This defines the type of document we want to create, "article" in this case

% Packages are used to include additional functionality
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % This is used for input encoding, in this case UTF-8
\usepackage{amsmath} % This package provides additional math functionality
\usepackage{graphicx} % This package allows for including images in the document
\usepackage{hyperref} % This package is used for creating hyperlinks

\title{My LaTeX Document} % This is the title of our document
\author{John Doe} % This is the author of the document
\date{\today} % This is the date the document was created, automatically set to current date

\begin{document} % We start our document here
\maketitle % This command creates the title page using the information provided above

\section{Introduction} % This is the start of a new section, "Introduction" in this case
LaTeX is a typesetting language commonly used in academic and scientific documents. It is known for its ability to produce professional-looking outputs with complex equations, citations, and formatting.

\section{Equations} % This is another section, "Equations" in this case
LaTeX has built-in commands for creating various types of equations, such as the quadratic formula:
\begin{equation} % This starts an equation environment, which will be automatically numbered
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} % This is the actual equation, using LaTeX's syntax for math expressions
\end{equation} % This ends the equation environment

We can also create a system of equations using the \texttt{align} environment:
\begin{align} % This starts the align environment, which aligns equations at certain points
3x + 2y &= 8 \\ % The double backslash starts a new line in the align environment
4x - y &= 3
\end{align} % This ends the align environment

\section{Graphics} % Another section, "Graphics" this time
We can easily include graphics in our document using the \texttt{includegraphics} command:
\begin{figure}[h] % This starts a figure environment, which is used for adding figures and captions
    \centering % This command centers the following content
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{diagram.png} % This includes the image "diagram.png" with a width of 50% of the line width
    \caption{A diagram of the LaTeX document structure} % This sets the caption for the figure
    \label{fig:diagram} % This sets a label for the figure, which can be referenced using the \ref{} command
\end{figure} % This ends the figure environment

\section{Hyperlinks} % Another section, "Hyperlinks" this time
We can also create hyperlinks in our document using the \texttt{href} command:
\begin{enumerate} % This starts an enumerate environment for creating numbered lists
    \item \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{The LaTeX Project} % This creates a hyperlink to the LaTeX Project website
    \item \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn}{Overleaf's LaTeX Tutorials} % This creates a hyperlink to Overleaf's LaTeX tutorials
\end{enumerate} % This ends the enumerate environment

\end{document} % This ends our document
