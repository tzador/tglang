\section{Introduction} % Creating a new section
This is an example of a long and complex LaTeX code snippet. We are using different packages and environments to create a nicely formatted document. % Adding text to the document

\subsection{Equations} % Creating a subsection
Here is an example of an equation using the \texttt{equation} environment:
\begin{equation}
F(x) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx % Setting the equation, where F(x) is the integral of f(x) from a to b
\end{equation}

Now, let's use the \texttt{align} environment to write a set of aligned equations:
\begin{align}
x + y &= z \\ % First equation
2x - 3y &= 5 % Second equation
\end{align}

\subsection{Tables} % Creating another subsection
We can also create tables using the \texttt{tabular} environment:
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} % Setting the alignment and borders of the table
    \hline % Adding a horizontal line
    Name & Age & Country \\ % Table headers
    \hline % Adding a horizontal line
    John & 25 & USA \\ % First row
    \hline % Adding a horizontal line
    Emily & 30 & Canada \\ % Second row
    \hline % Adding a horizontal line
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Figures} % Creating another subsection
We can also include figures in our document using the \texttt{figure} environment:
\begin{figure}[h] % Setting the position of the figure
    \centering % Centering the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image} % Including the image and setting its width
    \caption{Example Figure} % Adding a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:example} % Setting a label for referencing
\end{figure}

As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:example}, we can add captions and labels to our figures for easier referencing.

\section{Conclusion} % Creating another section
In conclusion, LaTeX provides us with a powerful and versatile way to create documents that are well-formatted and professional. With the use of packages and environments, we can include equations, tables, and figures easily in our document. % Adding text to the document
