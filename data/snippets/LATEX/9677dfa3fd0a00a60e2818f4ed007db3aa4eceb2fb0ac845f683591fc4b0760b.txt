\section{Introduction} %Creating a section heading

This is a LATEX code snippet to generate a document with a title, author, and date.

\section{Equations} %Creating another section heading

Here are some example equations:

\begin{equation*} %Starting an equation environment
    f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n %Writing a Taylor series equation
\end{equation*} %Ending the equation environment

\begin{equation*} %Starting another equation environment
    \frac{d}{dx} \int_{0}^{x} f(t) dt = f(x) %Writing a derivative of an integral equation
\end{equation*} %Ending the equation environment

\section{Conclusion} %Creating a final section heading

In conclusion, LATEX is a powerful tool for creating documents with advanced mathematical equations.
