The purpose of this document is to showcase the use of packages and formatting options in \LaTeX. %text in the subsection
\section{Mathematics} %section heading
\subsection{Equations} %subsection heading
Here are some of the equations used in this document: %text in the subsection
\begin{equation} %beginning of equation environment
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} %equation with fraction
\end{equation} %end of equation environment
\begin{align} %beginning of align environment
    sin^2 \theta + cos^2 \theta &= 1 \\ %equation with multiple lines and alignment at &
    e^{i\pi} + 1 &= 0 %second line of equation with alignment at &
\end{align} %end of align environment
\subsubsection{Proof} %subsubsection heading
We can prove the equations in this section using mathematical theorems and proofs. %text in the subsubsection
\begin{proof} %beginning of proof environment
    From the Pythagorean theorem, we know that $sin^2 \theta + cos^2 \theta = 1$. %text in proof environment, with inline equation
    Therefore, we can substitute the value of $sin^2 \theta$ from the first equation to the second equation to get: %continuing text in the proof environment
    \begin{align} %beginning of align environment
    1 + cos^2 \theta &= 1 \\ %equation with multiple lines and alignment at &
    e^{i\pi} + 1 &= 0 %second line of equation with alignment at &
    \end{align} %end of align environment
    which is true. %continuing text in the proof environment
\end{proof} %end of proof environment
