% Introduction section
\section{Introduction}

LaTeX is a powerful typesetting language that allows for precise and professional-looking documents.
One of its strengths is its ability to handle complex equations and mathematical notation.

% Body section
\section{Equations}
Here are some examples of complex equations typeset in LaTeX:

% This equation shows the use of the align* environment to align multiple equations
\begin{align*}
    f(x) &= \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x - 4 \\
    g(x) &= \sqrt{x+1}
\end{align*}

% This equation uses the gather* environment to separate equations with spacing
\begin{gather*}
    \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 0 \\
    \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = f'(a)
\end{gather*}

% This equation uses the cases environment to show a piecewise function
\[
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
                0 & x < 0 \\
                1 & x \geq 0
           \end{cases}
\]

% This equation uses the matrix environment to show a matrix
\[
    A = \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 2 \\
            3 & 4
        \end{pmatrix}
\]

% Conclusion section
\section{Conclusion}
Latex's ability to handle complex equations makes it a popular choice for mathematical and scientific documents.
By using the correct environments and syntax, one can easily typeset even the most complex equations in a professional and visually appealing manner.
