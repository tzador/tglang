    \subsection{History} % Starts a new subsection
    \LaTeX{} was created by Leslie Lamport in the 1980s as an extension to the TeX typesetting system. It focuses on the structure and layout of the document rather than its appearance, making it popular among academics and scientists for writing papers with complex equations and figures.
    
    \subsection{Usage} % Starts a new subsection
    To create a document in \LaTeX{}, we must first define the class of the document using the \textbackslash documentclass command. Then, we can use various packages to add features to our document like input encoding, images, mathematical equations, and hyperlinks. Finally, we can use commands like \textbackslash maketitle and \textbackslash tableofcontents to generate the title and table of contents respectively.
    
    \section{Mathematics}
    \LaTeX{} is well-known for its ability to typeset complex mathematical equations. We can use the \textbackslash begin\{equation\} environment to display a single-line equation or the \textbackslash begin\{align\} environment to display multiple equations with alignment. Here are some examples:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \int_{0}^{1} x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3} % Integrate function with limits
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{align}
        a^2 + b^2 &= c^2 \\ % Pythagorean theorem
        e^{i\pi} + 1 &= 0 % Euler's identity
    \end{align}
    
    \section{Hyperlinks}
    With the help of the \textit{hyperref} package, we can add hyperlinks to our document. We can use the \textbackslash href command to create a link to an external source and the \textbackslash url command to display a URL in the document. Here is an example:
    
    Please visit \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{the official \LaTeX{} project website} to learn more about this programming language. Or you can directly go to our GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/LaTeX/LaTeX}.
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    This concludes our complex document in \LaTeX{}. We have seen how to use packages, create mathematical equations, and add hyperlinks in our document. The possibilities with \LaTeX{} are endless, and with practice, you can create beautifully structured documents with ease.
