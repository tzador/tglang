\documentclass{article}
% This is the document class declaration, specifying what type of document we are creating.

\usepackage{amsmath}
% This is the amsmath package, which provides useful commands for typesetting math equations and symbols.

\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
% This sets the page margins to be 1 inch on all sides.

\usepackage{graphicx}
% This package allows us to insert and manipulate images in our document.

\begin{document}
% This marks the beginning of the document.

\title{My Complex Code Snippet in \LaTeX}
% This sets the title of the document.

\author{John Doe}
% This sets the author of the document.

\date{\today}
% This sets the date of the document to the current date.

\maketitle
% This command actually creates the title on the document.

\noindent
% This command prevents the following paragraph from being indented.

\section{Introduction}
% This creates a section titled "Introduction".

Here is my complex code snippet written in \LaTeX. This code will demonstrate some advanced formatting techniques.

\subsection{Equations}
% This creates a subsection titled "Equations".

Let's start with some math equations. We can use the \verb|equation| environment to create numbered equations:

\begin{equation}
    E = mc^2
\end{equation}

We can also use the \verb|align| environment to align multiple equations at the equal sign:

\begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dx} \cos(x) &= -\sin(x) \\
    \frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) &= \cos(x)
\end{align}

\subsection{Figures}
% This creates another subsection titled "Figures".

Now let's insert an image into our document using the \verb|includegraphics| command:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg}
    \caption{This is a caption for our image.}
    \label{fig:image}
\end{figure}

We can also reference this image in our document using the \verb|ref| command. For example, we can see in Figure \ref{fig:image} that the image is centered and has a caption below it.

\subsection{Tables}
% This creates another subsection titled "Tables".

Next, let's create a table using the \verb|tabular| environment:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        Column 1 & Column 2\\
        \hline
        Row 1 & 1\\
        Row 2 & 2\\
        Row 3 & 3\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{This is a caption for our table.}
    \label{tab:table}
\end{table}

We can also reference this table in our document using the \verb|ref| command. For example, we can see in Table \ref{tab:table} that the table is centered and has a caption above it.

\subsection{Code}
% This creates another subsection titled "Code".

Lastly, let's include a code snippet using the \verb|lstlisting| environment:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=This is a caption for our code snippet.,label=lst:code]
# This is a comment
print("Hello, world!")
\end{lstlisting}

We can also reference this code snippet in our document using the \verb|ref| command. For example, we can see in Listing \ref{lst:code} that the code is formatted nicely and has a caption and label.

\section{Conclusion}
% This creates a section titled "Conclusion".

That concludes our complex code snippet in \LaTeX. As we can see, \LaTeX has powerful features and is great for creating professional-looking documents with advanced formatting.
