\section{Introduction} %first section
Welcome to my first document in \LaTeX! Here, I will show you how to write a basic document using \LaTeX. 

\section{Formatting Text} %second section
To format text in \LaTeX, all you have to do is use the appropriate command. For \textbf{bold} text, use \verb|\textbf{Your text here}|. For \textit{italic} text, use \verb|\textit{Your text here}|. For \underline{underlined} text, use \verb|\underline{Your text here}|. And for \emph{emphasized} text, use \verb|\emph{Your text here}|.

\section{Including Images} %third section
To include an image in your document, first make sure you have the image saved in the same folder as your .tex file. Then, use the following code:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg}
    \caption{This is my image.}
    \label{fig:image}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

Here, \verb|\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg}| specifies the image to be included and its width. The \verb|[h]| parameter tells LaTeX to place the image here, and the \verb|\caption| and \verb|\label| commands add a caption and label to refer to the image.

\section{Creating Equations} %fourth section
To create equations in \LaTeX, you can use the \texttt{equation} environment:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
    E = mc^2
    \label{eq:emc2}
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

This will produce an equation with a number for referencing later, like this:

\begin{equation}
    E = mc^2
    \label{eq:emc2}
\end{equation}

You can also use math symbols in your equations, such as $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$, etc.

\section{Creating Links} %fifth section
To create links in your document, use the \verb|\url| command from the \texttt{hyperref} package. For example, to link to the \LaTeX{} website, use \verb|\url{https://www.latex-project.org}|. This will create a clickable link like this: \url{https://www.latex-project.org}.

\section{Conclusion} %last section
Congratulations, you now know the basics of creating a document in \LaTeX! There are many more features and commands to discover, so keep exploring and learning. Happy \TeX ing!
