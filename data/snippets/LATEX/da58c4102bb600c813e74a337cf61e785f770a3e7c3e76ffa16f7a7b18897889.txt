\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}
% This line specifies the document class, font size, and paper size.

\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
% This line specifies the margin size of the document.

\usepackage{amsmath}
% This line allows for the use of mathematical symbols and equations.

\usepackage{graphicx}
% This line allows for the insertion of images and graphics in the document.

\begin{document} % This begins the document.

Some introductory text and equations:

\noindent % This command removes indentation from the following text.
% 'noindent' is essential when starting a paragraph after a section or equation.

Let $f(x)$ be a differentiable function, then:
% The above line sets up an equation using math mode ($). 

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
% This is the equation format in 'amsmath' package. It inserts the mathematical limit and fraction symbols.
% The equation format sets the equation in a new line with automatic numbering.
\end{equation}

\noindent
Similarly, the power rule can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = n x^{n-1}
\end{equation}

%The above two equations demonstrate the use of equations and mathematical formulas in LATEX.

\vspace{5mm} % This command adds vertical space in the document.

Now let's insert an image:
% Use of double percentage (%) sign denotes a comment in LATEX.

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image.jpg}
% This command inserts an image with a specified scale. 
% By default, LATEX looks for the image in the same folder as the main document.
% The image should also be in the appropriate format, such as jpg, png, etc.

This is a lengthy and complex code snippet demonstrating the use of various packages and commands in LATEX.
