This code snippet creates a math equation using the 'equation*' environment in LaTeX. The equation uses a sum symbol and an integral symbol, with limits and fractions. The backslash '\' is used to denote special commands in LaTeX.

`\begin{equation*}`: Begins the equation environment.

`x =`: Assigns the variable 'x' to the following equation.

`\sum_{i=1}^{n}`: Creates the symbol for summation with index 'i=1' as the starting value and 'n' as the ending value.

`\frac{a_i}{b_i}`: Divides the value of 'a_i' by 'b_i'.

`+ \frac{\int_{0}^{1} f(x)\, dx}{c}`: Adds the result of the following integral to the equation, divided by the value of 'c'.

`\end{equation*}`: Ends the equation environment.
