%% Example usage
\theorem{1}{The sum of two even numbers is even.}

\begin{proof}
    Let $m$ and $n$ be even numbers. 
    Then, by definition, $m = 2k$ and $n = 2l$ for some integers $k$ and $l$. 
    Thus, we can write the sum of $m$ and $n$ as: 
    \begin{equation*} 
        m + n = 2k + 2l = 2(k+l) 
    \end{equation*} 
    Since $k$ and $l$ are also integers, $k + l$ is also an integer. 
    Therefore, we can express $m + n$ as $2q$, where $q = k + l$, 
    confirming that the sum of two even numbers is even. 
\end{proof}
