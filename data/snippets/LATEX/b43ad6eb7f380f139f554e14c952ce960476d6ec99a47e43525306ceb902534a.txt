\section{Methodology} 
% Adding another section with the title "Methodology"

The following equation demonstrates the use of the "align" environment from the "amsmath" package to align multiple equations: 

\begin{align} 
Pos(t) = Pos_0 + V_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 
\end{align} 

\begin{align*} 
Vel(t) = V_0 + at 
\end{align*} 

% Showing the use of the "align" environment for aligning equations 

where $Pos$ is the position, $V_0$ is the initial velocity, $a$ is the acceleration, and $t$ is the time variable. 
% Adding annotations to explain the variables used in the equations
