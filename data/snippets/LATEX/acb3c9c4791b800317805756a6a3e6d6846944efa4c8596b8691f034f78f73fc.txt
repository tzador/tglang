\section{Introduction}
This is a complex Latex code snippet.
It includes multiple packages and document formatting.

\subsection{Packages}
We start by declaring the necessary packages for our document.
Here, we have used \texttt{inputenc} to handle input encoding, \texttt{babel} for language support, \texttt{amsmath} for mathematical typesetting, and \texttt{graphicx} for including images.

\subsection{Title and Author}
Next, we define the title, author and date of our document using the \texttt{title}, \texttt{author} and \texttt{date} commands respectively.

\subsection{Table of Contents}
We use the \texttt{maketitle} command to generate the title page and the \texttt{tableofcontents} command to create a table of contents for our document.

\section{Body}
This is where we start writing the main body of our document.
We can add different sections and subsections using the \texttt{section} and \texttt{subsection} commands.

\subsection{Text Formatting}
Latex provides various commands for formatting text.
We can use the \texttt{textbf} command for bold text, \texttt{textit} for italic text, and \texttt{texttt} for monospaced text.

\subsection{Mathematical Equations}
To include mathematical equations, we use the \texttt{equation} environment.
Inside this environment, we can use different mathematical symbols and operators provided by the \texttt{amsmath} package.

\subsection{Figures}
We can use the \texttt{figure} environment to include figures in our document.
We can also add captions and labels to our figures for referencing using the \texttt{caption} and \texttt{label} commands.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.png}
    \caption{Example Figure}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}
Latex also allows us to create tables using the \texttt{tabular} environment.
We can specify the number of columns and their alignment as well as add borders and formatting options.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} & \textbf{Column 3} \\ \hline
Entry 1           & Entry 2           & Entry 3           \\ \hline
Entry 4           & Entry 5           & Entry 6           \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example Table}
\label{tab:example}
\end{table}

\section{Conclusion}
In this code snippet, we have explored a variety of features and commands in Latex.
With more practice and experience, we can create even more complex and professional-looking documents.
