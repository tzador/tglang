\section{Introduction}
Machine learning has seen a surge in popularity in recent years, with its applications ranging from self-driving cars to image recognition. However, its potential in solving mathematical problems is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines \textbf{deep learning} methods with genetic algorithms to tackle complex optimization problems.

\section{Background}
Before delving into our methodology, it is important to understand the basic concepts of machine learning and genetic algorithms. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to improve their performance on a specific task. Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, are inspired by the natural process of evolution and use concepts such as mutation and crossover to optimize solutions.

\section{Methodology}
Our proposed approach combines the strengths of both machine learning and genetic algorithms. We use a neural network to model the problem and optimize its parameters using a genetic algorithm. This allows us to find the best possible solution while also taking into account the complexity of the problem.

\subsection{Neural Network Architecture}
The neural network used in our approach consists of \textit{input}, \textit{hidden}, and \textit{output} layers. The number of neurons in the input layer is equal to the dimensionality of the problem, while the number of neurons in the output layer is equal to the number of variables to be optimized. The hidden layers can vary in number and size, depending on the complexity of the problem.

\subsection{Genetic Algorithm Operations}
The genetic algorithm operates on a population of neural networks, with each network representing a potential solution to the problem. The algorithm performs three main operations: selection, mutation, and crossover. During selection, individuals with the highest fitness values are chosen to move on to the next iteration. Mutation involves randomly changing a small percentage of the network's parameters, while crossover combines the parameters of two networks to create a new one.

\section{Results}
We tested our proposed approach on various optimization problems, including the knapsack problem and the traveling salesman problem. Our results show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of accuracy and computation time.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented a new approach that combines machine learning and genetic algorithms to solve complex optimization problems. Our results show the potential of this approach and its superiority over traditional methods. Further research can be done to explore the use of different neural network architectures and genetic operators to improve the performance of our approach.
