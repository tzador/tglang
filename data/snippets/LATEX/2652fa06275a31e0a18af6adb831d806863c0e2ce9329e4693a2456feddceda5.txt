\begin{document} //Indicates the start of the document

\section{Examples of Mathematical Equations} //Creates a new section titled "Examples of Mathematical Equations"

\subsection{Basic Addition} //Creates a subsection titled "Basic Addition"

To add two numbers, we use the equation \[a + b = c\] //Displays the equation for adding two numbers in math mode

where \(a\) and \(b\) are the two numbers and \(c\) is the sum of the two numbers.

\subsection{Quadratic Formula} //Creates a subsection titled "Quadratic Formula"

The quadratic formula is given by \[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\] //Displays the quadratic formula in math mode

where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the coefficients in the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).
