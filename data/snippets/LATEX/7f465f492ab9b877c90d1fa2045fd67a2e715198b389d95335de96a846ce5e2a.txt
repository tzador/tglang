\section{Introduction} %Creating a new section

This is a sample code snippet in LATEX. In this snippet, we will be using various packages and commands to create a basic document.

\section{Equations} %Creating a new section

Let's start by adding some mathematical equations to our document. The following is an example of the Pythagorean theorem:

\begin{equation} %Beginning of the equation environment
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 %Equation
\end{equation} %End of the equation environment

We can also use the align environment to add multiple equations with alignment:

\begin{align} %Beginning of the align environment
2x + 5y &= 12 \\ %First equation with alignment at &
3x - 4y &= 5 %Second equation with no alignment
\end{align} %End of the align environment

\section{Adding Images} %Creating a new section

Let's now add an image to our document. We will use the graphicx package for this. 

\begin{figure}[h] %Beginning of the figure environment with placement specifier h (here)
\centering %Centering the image
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} %Inserting the image with a width of 50% of the text width
\caption{Sample Image} %Caption for the image
\label{fig:sample} %Label for referencing the image
\end{figure} %End of the figure environment

Figure \ref{fig:sample} shows a sample image included in our document.

\section{Conclusion} %Creating a new section

In this code snippet, we learned how to use various packages and command in LATEX to create a basic document with equations and images. Refer to the official documentation for more information on customizing and formatting your LATEX document.
