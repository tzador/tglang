\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath} % for mathematical symbols
\usepackage{graphicx} % for including images
\title{My Document} % declare the title of the document
\author{John Doe} % declare the author of the document
\date{\today} % declare today's date as the date of the document
\begin{document}
\maketitle % create the title page with the information provided
\newpage % create a new page
\section{Introduction} % create a new section titled "Introduction"
This document is an example of a \texttt{latex} document.
% This line outputs "This document is an example of a latex document." in a typewriter font
Here, we will include an image below:
\begin{figure}[h] % declare a figure environment, [h] specifies to place the figure here
	\centering % center the image
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image} % include the image "example-image" with a width of half the document's text width
	\caption{This is an example image.} % caption the image with the text "This is an example image."
	\label{fig:example} % label the image as "fig:example" for referencing it later
\end{figure}
Now, let's try some mathematical symbols:
\begin{equation*} % declare an unnumbered equation environment
	\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} % output the summation symbol, limits of n from 1 to infinity, and the equation
\end{equation*}
This is known as the \emph{Basel problem}.
% The above line outputs "This is known as the Basel problem." in italics
