\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction section where background information is provided. % Creates a new section in the document
We will be discussing the use of \LaTeX{} for creating professional documents.

\section{Basic Formatting}
In this section, we will learn about basic formatting in \LaTeX{}.

\subsection{Text Formatting}
There are various ways to format text in \LaTeX{}, including \textbf{bold}, \textit{italic}, and \underline{underline}.
% \subsection creates a subsection within the current section
% \textbf, \textit, and \underline are commands used to format text

\subsection{Paragraph Formatting}
Paragraphs in \LaTeX{} are automatically indented. You can also add extra spacing between paragraphs by using the \textbackslash \textbackslash  command.

\subsection{Lists}
\begin{itemize} % The \begin and \end commands are used to create a new list environment
    \item First item % \item is used to denote each item in a list
    \item Second item
    \item Third item
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical Equations}
In this section, we will learn about typesetting mathematical equations in \LaTeX{}.

\subsection{Inline Equations}
Inline equations, such as $E=mc^2$, can be inserted by wrapping the equations in dollar signs.

\subsection{Display Equations}
Display equations, such as \[\int_{a}^{b} \frac{1}{x^2} dx = \frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b}\], can be inserted using the double dollar sign notation.

\subsection{Multi-line Equations}
Multi-line equations can be typeset using the \texttt{align} environment.
\begin{align*}
    x + y &= x^2 \\ % The & sign aligns the equations at the chosen position
    y       &= x \cdot \cos(x)
\end{align*}

\section{Including Images}
Adding images in \LaTeX{} is made simple with the \texttt{graphicx} package.
% The \texttt command is used to display text in typewriter font
\begin{figure}[h] % The \begin and \end commands are used to create a figure environment
    \centering % Centers the image
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} % Includes the image 'image.jpg' with a width of half the document width
    \caption{An example image} % Adds a caption to the image
    \label{fig:example} % Creates a label for referencing the image
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:example}, we can see an example image included in the document.

\section{Conclusion}
We have explored basic formatting, mathematical equations, and including images in \LaTeX{}. This powerful tool allows for the creation of professional and visually appealing documents.
