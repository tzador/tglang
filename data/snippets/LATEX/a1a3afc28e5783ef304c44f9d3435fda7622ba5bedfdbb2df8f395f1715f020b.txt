\documentclass[12pt]{article} % sets the document class and font size (12pt)
\usepackage{graphicx} % imports the graphicx package for including graphics
\usepackage{amsmath} % imports the amsmath package for advanced math formatting
\usepackage{hyperref} % imports the hyperref package for creating hyperlinks within the document

\begin{document} % starts the document
\title{My LaTeX Document} % sets the title of the document
\author{John Doe} % sets the author of the document
\maketitle % generates the title page

\section{Introduction} % starts a new section titled "Introduction"
LaTeX is a powerful typesetting language used for creating documents with professional quality formatting. It is widely used in the academic and scientific community for writing articles, reports, and books. In this document, we will learn some of the basics of creating a LaTeX document.

\subsection{Document Structure} % starts a subsection titled "Document Structure"
LaTeX documents have a specific structure that must be followed. A document starts with the \verb|\documentclass| command that specifies the type of document and its formatting. Then, the \verb|\usepackage| command is used to import any necessary packages. After this, the document starts with the \verb|\begin{document}| command and ends with the \verb|\end{document}| command. Everything in between these commands is part of the document's content.

\section{Equations} % starts a new section titled "Equations"
LaTeX has built-in support for typesetting mathematical equations. For example, the equation
\begin{equation} % starts an equation environment
E=mc^2 % actual equation
\end{equation} % ends the equation environment
is typeset with the \verb|equation| environment. Equations can also be labelled for future references, like this:
\begin{equation} % starts an equation environment
F=ma % actual equation
\label{eq:force} % label for reference
\end{equation} % ends the equation environment
Now, we can refer to this equation using the \verb|\ref| command, like this: Equation \ref{eq:force}.

\section{Figures and Tables} % starts a new section titled "Figures and Tables"
LaTeX also has support for including figures and tables in a document. To do so, we need to use the \verb|figure| and \verb|table| environments. For example, to include a figure, we use the following code:
\begin{figure}[h] % starts a figure environment with 'h' specifier
\centering % centers the figure
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image} % includes the image with 50% of the line width
\caption{Example figure} % adds a caption to the figure
\label{fig:example} % adds a label for reference
\end{figure} % ends the figure environment
We can also create tables in a similar way using the \verb|table| environment. Tables can be referenced using the \verb|\ref| command, similar to equations.

\section{Hyperlinks} % starts a new section titled "Hyperlinks"
One of the great features of LaTeX is its ability to generate hyperlinks within the document. This can be done using the \verb|hyperref| package, which we imported earlier. We can create hyperlinks using the \verb|\href| command, like this: \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{LaTeX Project}. We can also link to another part of the document using the \verb|\ref| command, like this: \ref{fig:example}.

\section{Conclusion} % starts a new section titled "Conclusion"
This is just a brief overview of some of the features of LaTeX. There are many more commands and packages available for creating professional documents. With practice, you can create beautiful documents with LaTeX that are sure to impress.

\end{document} % ends the document
