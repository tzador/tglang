\section{Introduction}
Welcome to your code snippet in \LaTeX!
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use the \LaTeX{} documentclass and basic packages.
\subsection{Code Explanation}
%%% This section explains the code
The first line, \verb|%%% !TeX document class|, sets the documentclass to \verb|article|. It also enables the \verb|twocolumn| option, which creates a document with two columns instead of one. \\* % This creates a new line without the new paragraph indent
The next three lines (\verb|\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}|, \verb|\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}|, and \verb|\usepackage{amsmath}|) set the input encoding, font encoding, and provide the \verb|amsmath| package, respectively. \\*
After that, we have the \verb|graphicx| package, which allows us to import images into our document. Finally, the \verb|titlesec| package is used to customize section and subsection titles. In this case, we have used the \verb|titleformat| command to specify the style and format of our section titles. The \verb|\thesection.\space| code adds the section number followed by a dot and a space before the title. \\*
In the document itself, we have created a section titled \verb|Introduction| using the \verb|\section| command. Inside this section, we have a subsection titled \verb|Purpose| and another one titled \verb|Code Explanation|. \\*
The output of this code will be a document with two columns, an Introduction section with two subsections, and customized section titles.
