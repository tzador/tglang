\documentclass{article} % This is a LaTeX document class that defines the type of document we are creating

% Packages are used to import additional features and functionalities to our document
\usepackage{amsmath} % This package allows us to use extended mathematical notation and symbols
\usepackage{graphicx} % This package allows us to include images in our document
\usepackage{color} % This package allows us to use colors in our document

\title{My Complex LaTeX Document} % The title of our document
\author{John Doe} % The name of the author
\date{\today} % The current date will be automatically inserted

\begin{document} % This marks the beginning of our document

\maketitle % Inserts the title, author, and date into our document

\tableofcontents % Creates a table of contents based on the sections and subsections in our document

\section{Introduction} % This is a section heading, we can have multiple sections in our document
This is a long and complex \LaTeX{} document that showcases the power of this markup language. In this document, we will be using various packages and features to create beautiful and professional-looking documents.

\subsection{Paragraphs} % This is a subsection heading, similar to sections but with a lower level of hierarchy
Paragraphs are automatically indented in \LaTeX{}, and we can use the \verb|\par| command to create a new paragraph. % The \verb command allows us to insert inline code and the | symbol is used to enclose the code

\subsection{Mathematical Equations}
\LaTeX{} has powerful features for typesetting mathematical equations. We can use the \verb|equation| environment to display equations with numbering or the \verb|equation*| environment for unnumbered equations. Here's an example:

\begin{equation*} % The asterisk (*) removes the numbering
	f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_C \frac{f(z)}{z-z_0}dz
\end{equation*} % The equation is automatically centered

\subsection{Tables and Figures}
We can use the \verb|table| environment to create tables in our document. The \verb|tabular| environment allows us to define the structure of our table. We can also use the \verb|includegraphics| command from the \verb|graphicx| package to include images in our document. Here's an example:

\begin{table}[h] % The [h] stands for "here", this tells LaTeX to place the table exactly where it is in the text
	\centering % This centers the table
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} % This defines a table with two columns, with vertical lines (|) between them
		\hline % This inserts a horizontal line in the table
		\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Age} \\ % The & symbol separates the cells
		\hline
		John Doe & 25 \\
		\hline
		Jane Smith & 30 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Example Table} % This adds a caption to our table
	\label{tab:example} % This adds a label to our table, which we can use to refer to it later in our document
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:example} shows an example image included in our document.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image} % The width can be adjusted to resize the image
	\caption{Example Image}
	\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Custom Commands and Environments}
If we want to make our life easier, we can define our own custom commands and environments. This can help us save time and make our code more readable. For example, we can define a command for quickly inserting a blue text:

\newcommand{\bluetext}[1]{\textcolor{blue}{#1}} % The #1 is a placeholder for our input, in this case, the blue text

We can now use the command \verb|\bluetext{}| to insert blue text, like this \bluetext{This is blue text}. We can also create an environment to highlight certain sections of our document:

\newenvironment{highlight}{\color{orange}}{\color{black}} % Everything between the curly braces will be highlighted in orange

\begin{highlight}
This is a highlighted section. % This will be highlighted in orange
\end{highlight}

\subsection{Citations and References}
We can use the \verb|cite| command to insert citations in our document. We need to first add our bibliography in a separate \verb|.bib| file and then use the \verb|bibliographystyle| and \verb|bibliography| commands to insert it into our document. Here's an example citation: \cite{einstein}. We can also use the \verb|label| and \verb|ref| commands to refer to different parts of our document. For example, we can refer back to our table from earlier by writing ``Table~\ref{tab:example}''.

% This is where we insert our bibliography
\bibliographystyle{plain} % This defines the style of our bibliography
\bibliography{references} % This is the name of our .bib file where we add our references

\end{document} % This marks the end of our document
