This is an example of a basic document in LATEX. % printing a line of text

Let's look at some examples of using the custom commands we defined in the preamble:

% printing a vector using the 'vect' command
The vector $\vect{x}$ has components $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$.

% printing a matrix using the 'mat' command
The matrix $\mat{A}$ has elements $a_{ij}$, where $i$ and $j$ are indices.

% printing a dimensionless number using the 'dimless' command
The Reynolds number is defined as $\dimless{Re} = \frac{\rho U L}{\mu}$, where $\rho$ is density, $U$ is velocity, $L$ is length, and $\mu$ is viscosity.

% printing a differential operator using the 'diff' command
The differential operator $\diff{}$ represents the derivative with respect to the variable inside the parentheses.
