This is a simple document demonstrating how to use \LaTeX\ to create structured documents.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
This section will introduce the basics of \LaTeX. The first important command is \verb|\documentclass|, which specifies the type of document we are creating. In this case, we are creating an article. 

\subsection{Document Structure}
A \LaTeX\ document is structured into different sections, each with its own formatting. These include titles, headings, paragraphs, and lists.

\subsubsection*{Title}
The title of the document is specified using the \verb|\title| command. We can also include an optional subtitle using the \verb|\subtitle| command. After specifying the title, we use the \verb|\maketitle| command to generate the title page.

\section{Formatting Text}
Text in a \LaTeX\ document can be formatted using different commands. For example, to make text \textbf{bold}, we use the \verb|\textbf| command. Similarly, to make text \textit{italic}, we use the \verb|\textit| command. We can also use the \verb|\underline| command to \underline{underline} text.

\section{Lists}
Lists can be created in \LaTeX\ using the \verb|itemize| environment for bulleted lists and the \verb|enumerate| environment for numbered lists. For example:

\begin{itemize}
  \item First item in a bulleted list
  \item Second item in a bulleted list
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item First item in a numbered list
  \item Second item in a numbered list
\end{enumerate}

\section{Equations}
Equations can be easily typeset in \LaTeX\ using the \verb|equation| environment. For example, the famous equation $E = mc^2$ can be typeset as:
\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\end{equation}

We can also use the \verb|align| environment to align multiple equations, such as the following system of equations:

\begin{align}
2x + 3y &= 8 \\
4x + 9y &= 12
\end{align}

\section{Conclusion}
This document has provided a simple example of using \LaTeX\ to create structured documents. With practice, you can create complex documents with ease using this powerful typesetting tool.
