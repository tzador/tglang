This is a complex code snippet written in \LaTeX, showcasing various features and functionalities of the language.

\subsection{Equations} % starting a subsection for equations
LATEX has powerful features for writing mathematical equations, such as the popular \textit{amsmath} package. Below is an example of an equation with a number and label:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pythagoras}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}
We can also refer to this equation with its label using the \textit{ref} command: Equation \ref{eq:pythagoras} is known as the Pythagorean theorem.

\subsection{Tables} % starting a subsection for tables
Tables can be created in LATEX using the \textit{tabular} environment. Here is an example of a complex table with different rows and columns:
\begin{table}[H] % use the "H" option to place the table exactly where it is typed
    \centering % center the table
    \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } % create a table with three centered columns
    \hline % draw a horizontal line
    \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Age} & \textbf{Occupation} \\ % add table headers
    \hline
    John & 25 & Programmer \\
    \hline
    Jane & 28 & Teacher \\
    \hline
    Alex & 30 & Engineer \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Information of Individuals} % add a caption for the table
    \label{tab:info} % add a label for the table
\end{table}
We can refer to this table by its label using the \textit{ref} command: Table \ref{tab:info} shows the information of three individuals.

\subsection{Figures} % starting a subsection for figures
Figures can be inserted in LATEX using the \textit{figure} environment. Here is an example of a complex figure with a caption and label:
\begin{figure}[ht] % use the "ht" option to place the figure at the top of the page
    \centering % center the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{example_image.jpg} % insert the image with 50% width of the text width
    \caption{Example Figure} % add a caption for the figure
    \label{fig:example} % add a label for the figure
\end{figure}
We can refer to this figure by its label using the \textit{ref} command: Figure \ref{fig:example} shows an example image.

\subsection{Lists} % starting a subsection for lists
LATEX has different types of lists for organizing information. Here is an example of a nested list:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First item
    \item Second item
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Subitem 1
        \item Subitem 2
    \end{itemize}
    \item Third item
\end{itemize}
This is just one type of list, there are also numbered lists, description lists, and more.

\section{Conclusion} % starting the conclusion section
In conclusion, \LaTeX is a powerful language for creating high-quality documents with mathematical equations, tables, figures, and more. It allows for precise and professional formatting and is widely used in academia and scientific publications.
