\documentclass{article} % This line specifies the class or type of document
\usepackage{amsmath} % This package includes various useful mathematical symbols and environments

\title{Complex Latex Code} % Title of the document
\author{John Doe} % Author of the document
\date{\today} % Date of the document, \today will automatically insert today's date

\begin{document} % Tells the compiler to begin document
\maketitle % Uses the information provided to automatically generate a title and author section

\section{Introduction} % Creates a new section with the title "Introduction"
This is a complex Latex code snippet in \LaTeX. % Text within the section

\section{Equations} % Creates another new section with the title "Equations"
We can write mathematical equations easily using Latex, such as the Pythagorean theorem: % Text within the section
\begin{equation} % Begins an equation environment
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 % The actual equation written in Latex syntax
\end{equation} % Ends the equation environment

\section{Lists and Tables} % Creates another new section with the title "Lists and Tables"
We can also create lists and tables, here is an example: % Text within the section
\begin{itemize} % Begins an itemize environment, creating a bulleted list
\item First item % First item in the list
\item Second item % Second item in the list
\end{itemize} % Ends the itemize environment
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} % Begins a table environment with 3 columns, each with centered alignment and vertical lines between them
\hline % Draws a horizontal line
\textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} & \textbf{Column 3} \\ % Inserts table headers
\hline % Draws another horizontal line
Item 1 & Item 2 & Item 3 \\ % Inserts row 1 data
\hline % Draws another horizontal line
Item 4 & Item 5 & Item 6 \\ % Inserts row 2 data
\hline % Draws another horizontal line
\end{tabular} % Ends the table environment

\section{Figures} % Creates another new section with the title "Figures"
Latex can also handle figures, like this: % Text within the section
\begin{figure}[h] % Begins a figure environment and sets its position as "here"
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} % Inserts an image and sets its width as 50% of the text width
\caption{A sample image} % Creates a caption for the figure
\end{figure} % Ends the figure environment

\end{document} % Ends the document
