\documentclass{article} 
%% This line specifies the type of document we are creating, in this case, an article
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
%% Specifies the character encoding for the document, in this case, UTF-8 
\usepackage{amsmath}
%% Loads the amsmath package, which contains various useful mathematical commands and symbols
\usepackage{graphicx}
%% Loads the graphicx package, which allows for the insertion of images into the document
%% Begin document
\begin{document} 
%% This command starts the document 
\title{My First LaTeX Document} 
%% Specifies the title of the document
\author{John Doe} 
%% Specifies the author of the document
\date{\today} 
%% Specifies the date, using the current date 
\maketitle 
%% Prints the title, author, and date in the document 
\section{Introduction} 
%% Creates a new section in the document titled "Introduction"
LaTeX is a typesetting language used for creating high-quality documents, particularly in the fields of mathematics, science, and engineering. It is based on the TeX typesetting system and offers a wide range of formatting capabilities. 
%% The text within the "Introduction" section 
\section{Equations} 
%% Creates a new section in the document titled "Equations"
In LaTeX, equations can be displayed within the text using the \verb|$$| delimiters. For example, the quadratic formula can be typeset as follows: $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$ 
%% Typesets the quadratic formula using the math formatting capabilities of LaTeX 
Alternatively, equations can also be displayed on their own line using the \verb|\begin{equation}| and \verb|\end{equation}| commands. For example, we can display the Pythagorean theorem as follows: 
\begin{equation} 
%% Opens the equation environment 
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 
%% The actual equation we want to display
\end{equation} 
%% Closes the equation environment 
\section{Figures} 
%% Creates a new section in the document titled "Figures"
Images can be easily inserted into LaTeX documents using the \verb|\includegraphics| command. For example, we can display the logo of LaTeX itself by including the file "latex_logo.png": 
\begin{figure}[h] 
%% Opens the figure environment with the option "h" for "here", specifying that we want the figure to appear at this exact spot in the document 
\centering 
%% Centers the following graphics 
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{latex_logo.png} 
%% Specifies the image file and sets the width to be half the text width 
\caption{The LaTeX Logo} 
%% Adds a caption to the figure 
\label{fig:latex_logo} 
%% Labels the figure for later reference
\end{figure} 
%% Closes the figure environment 
Figure \ref{fig:latex_logo} shows the logo of LaTeX. 
%% References the labeled figure within the text 
\section{Conclusion} 
%% Creates a new section in the document titled "Conclusion"
LaTeX offers a powerful and flexible way to create professional-looking documents. With its advanced formatting capabilities and support for mathematical equations and images, it is the preferred choice for many scientists and researchers. 
%% Text within the "Conclusion" section 
\end{document} 
%% Ends the document
