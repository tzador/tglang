\section{Introduction} % Begin introduction section
This code shows the steps involved in processing a signal within a system. The signals can be analog or digital and can come from various sources such as sensors, microphones, or cameras. The goal of signal processing is to extract meaningful information from the signals that can be used for further analysis or control.

\section{Signal Acquisition} % Begin signal acquisition section
The first step in signal processing is to acquire the signal. This can be done using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for analog signals or simply reading digital signals from a source. In this code, we will assume that the signal is acquired using an ADC with a sampling frequency of $f_s$.

\section{Data Preprocessing} % Begin data preprocessing section
Once the signal is acquired, it needs to be preprocessed before further analysis. This step involves removing any noise or artifacts present in the signal. The code snippet below shows how this can be done using a butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of $f_c$.

\begin{verbatim}
[b,a] = butter(n,wc/(fs/2),'high');
y = filter(b,a,x);
\end{verbatim}

In the code above, we use the \verb|butter| function to design a $n$th order butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of $f_c$. The resulting filter coefficients are stored in the arrays \verb|b| and \verb|a|. Then, the \verb|filter| function is used to filter the input signal \verb|x| with the defined filter coefficients. The output of this step is a preprocessed signal \verb|y|.

\section{Feature Extraction} % Begin feature extraction section
After preprocessing the signal, the next step is to extract features that are relevant for further analysis or control. These features can be time-domain, frequency-domain, or time-frequency domain features. In this code, we will extract the mean and standard deviation of the preprocessed signal.

\begin{verbatim}
mean = mean(y);
std = std(y);
\end{verbatim}

In the code above, we use the built-in \verb|mean| and \verb|std| functions to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the input signal \verb|y|. The resulting values are stored in the variables \verb|mean| and \verb|std|.

\section{Visualization} % Begin visualization section
Visualizing the signal and its features can provide valuable insights and aid in understanding the signal. The code snippet below shows how to plot the preprocessed signal and its extracted features.

\begin{verbatim}
% Plot preprocessed signal
plot(y);
xlabel('Time');
ylabel('Amplitude');
title('Preprocessed Signal');

% Plot extracted features
figure;
bar([mean,std]);
xlabel('Feature');
ylabel('Value');
title('Extracted Features');
legend({'Mean', 'Std'});
\end{verbatim}

The first part of the code plots the preprocessed signal with time on the x-axis and amplitude on the y-axis. The title and axis labels are also specified. The second part of the code uses the \verb|bar| function to create a bar graph of the extracted features with their respective values on the y-axis. The \verb|legend| function is used to label the bars as \verb|Mean| and \verb|Std|.

\section{Conclusion} % Begin conclusion section
In this code, we have presented the steps involved in processing a signal within a system. This process can be used for a wide range of applications such as noise removal, feature extraction, and pattern recognition. Further analysis or control of the signal can be done using the extracted features.
