\section{Introduction}		%section for introduction
This document will show you how to use various packages and create different elements like math equations, images and source code in \LaTeX.

\section{Math Equations}		%section for math equations
To create inline math equations, use the {\ttfamily \$\$} symbol. For example, to write the equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, we use the code {\ttfamily \$\$a\textbackslash{}\textasciicircum{}2 + b\textbackslash{}\textasciicircum{}2 = c\textbackslash{}\textasciicircum{}2 \$\$}. To create display style math equations, use the {\ttfamily equation} and the {\ttfamily align} environments. For example, to write the Pythagoras theorem in display style, we use the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Tex]	%lstlisting environment for displaying source code
\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}
\begin{align}
a &= \sqrt{c^2 - b^2} \\
b &= \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}
\end{align}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Images}		%section for images
To include images in your document, use the {\ttfamily includegraphics} command. For example, to include an image named {\ttfamily sample.png} in your document, use the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Tex]
\includegraphics{sample.png}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Source Code}		%section for source code
To include source code in your document, use the {\ttfamily lstlisting} environment. For example, to include a Python program in your document, use the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def fibonacci(n):		#function to find the nth term in Fibonacci series
	if n <= 1:
		return n
	else:
		return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))		#prints the 10th term of the Fibonacci series
\end{lstlisting}
