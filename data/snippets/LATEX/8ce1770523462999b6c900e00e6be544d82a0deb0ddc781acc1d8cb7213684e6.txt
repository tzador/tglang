Hello world!

\textbf{Hello} %%%% This is a comment mixed with code

%%%% The following code generates a matrix

\[
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 \\
        3 & 4
    \end{bmatrix}
\]

%%%% The following code generates a theorem with proof

\begin{theorem}
    If $x$ is an integer, then $x^2$ is also an integer.
\end{theorem}

%%%% Proof of the theorem

\begin{proof}
    Let $x$ be an integer. Then $x = 2k$ for some integer $k$. \\
    Since $x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$, and $4k^2$ is also an integer, \\
    we can conclude that $x^2$ is an integer.
\end{proof}
