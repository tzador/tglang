% Title and Author
\title{My Complex LATEX Code} % Specifies the title of the document

\begin{document} % Begins the document

\maketitle % Generates the title based on the specified title and author

% Abstract and Table of Contents
\begin{abstract}
This code snippet is a complex LATEX document that includes various packages, a title, and author. It also has an abstract and table of contents.
\end{abstract}

\tableofcontents % Generates a table of contents based on sections and subsections in the document

% Introduction
\section{Introduction} % Creates a section titled "Introduction"
LATEX is a powerful typesetting tool that is widely used in academia and industry for creating complex documents such as research papers, reports, and books. It is based on the TEX typesetting system and provides a high level of control over document layout and formatting.

% Basic Formatting
\section{Basic Formatting}
LATEX code is written in plain text and is compiled into a PDF document. To create basic formatting, such as bold or italic text, we use special commands that start with a backslash, such as \textbf{bold} or \textit{italic}. These commands can also be combined, for example, \textbf{\textit{bold and italic}}.

% Mathematical Equations
\section{Mathematical Equations}
One of LATEX's strengths is its ability to handle complex mathematical expressions and equations. This is done using the \textit{amsmath} package, which provides a wide range of tools for formatting equations. For example, we can write the famous Euler's formula as $e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x$. LATEX also allows you to number equations for easy referencing, as shown in Equation \ref{eq:pythagorean}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:pythagorean}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}

% Including Images
\section{Including Images}
Images can be easily included in a LATEX document using the \textit{graphicx} package. This includes graphics files in various formats such as JPEG, PNG, and PDF. The images can also be resized and positioned using the \textit{includegraphics} command. Figure \ref{fig:latexlogo} shows an example of including an image.

\begin{figure}[h] % Starts a floating figure with "h" as the preferred placement
\centering % Centers the image
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{latexlogo.png} % Includes the image "latexlogo.png" and sets it to 50% the width of the text
\caption{The LATEX logo} % Adds a caption
\label{fig:latexlogo} % Adds a label for referencing
\end{figure}

% Adding Code Listings
\section{Adding Code Listings}
Another useful feature of LATEX is its ability to include code listings, which is especially useful for writing technical documents. This is done using the \textit{listings} package, which supports multiple programming languages and allows for syntax highlighting. Listing \ref{lst:examplecode} shows an example of including Python code in a document.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={An example of Python code in a LATEX document}, label={lst:examplecode}] % Starts a code listing with the language set to Python, adds a caption, and sets a label for referencing
print("Hello, world!") # Prints the famous "Hello, world!" message
\end{lstlisting}

% Bibliography Management
\section{Bibliography Management}
LATEX has built-in support for managing bibliographies and citations, making it ideal for writing research papers and reports. This is achieved using the \textit{cite} package, which allows you to add references and generate citations automatically. For example, we can cite the LATEX project by using \cite{latex-project}.

% Hyperlinks
\section{Hyperlinks}
The \textit{hyperref} package lets you add clickable hyperlinks to your document, making it easier for readers to navigate through the document. This is particularly useful for documents with a large table of contents and cross-references. For example, we can add a hyperlink to the LATEX homepage using \url{https://www.latex-project.org/}.

% References
\bibliographystyle{unsrt} % Specifies the bibliography style
\bibliography{references} % Specifies the bibliography file, in this case "references.bib"
