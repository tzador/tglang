\begin{abstract}  % This line creates an abstract section for the document
This is a long and complex code snippet in Latex. It includes various essential packages, such as \texttt{amsmath}, \texttt{amsthm}, \texttt{amssymb}, and \texttt{graphicx}. It also sets the title, author, and date for the document. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}  % This line creates a section titled "Introduction"

This code snippet demonstrates the use of various Latex commands and packages to create a complex document.

\section{Equations}

Here is an example of a numbered equation:

\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{equation}

And an unnumbered equation:

\[
    \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]

\section{Figures}

We can also include figures in our document, like this one:

\begin{figure}[h]  % This line specifies the position of the figure (h = here)
    \centering  % This line centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig.png}  % This line includes the figure named "fig.png" and sets its size
    \caption{Example Figure}  % This line sets the caption for the figure
    \label{fig:example}  % This line sets a label for the figure, which can be referenced later in the document
\end{figure}

As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:example}, figures can be referenced by their label in the text.

\section{Theorems}

Latex also provides a convenient way to typeset theorems:

\begin{theorem}
    For any positive integer $n$, let $S=\{1,2,...,n\}$. Then, the sum of the first $n$ positive integers is given by $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We can prove this statement using mathematical induction:
    
    \textit{Base case:} For $n=1$, we have $S=\{1\}$ and the sum of the first positive integer is indeed $\frac{1(1+1)}{2}=1$.
    
    \textit{Inductive step:} Assuming the statement holds for some positive integer $n$, we can show that it holds for $n+1$ as well:
    
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} i &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} i + (n+1) \tag*{by definition}\\
        &= \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1) \tag*{by inductive hypothesis}\\
        &= \frac{n(n+1)+2(n+1)}{2} \tag*{combining terms}\\
        &= \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \tag*{factoring}\\
        &= \frac{(n+1)[(n+1)+1]}{2} \tag*{simplifying}\\
    \end{align*}
    
    Therefore, the statement holds for $n+1$ as well, and by mathematical induction, it holds for all positive integers $n$.
\end{proof}

\section{Conclusion}

We have demonstrated how to use various Latex commands and packages to create a complex document that includes equations, figures, and theorems.
