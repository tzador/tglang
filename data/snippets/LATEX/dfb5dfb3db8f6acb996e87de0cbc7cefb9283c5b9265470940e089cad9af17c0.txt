\section{Introduction}
This section introduces the document and provides some background information on the topic being discussed. We can include references to other sources by using the \verb|\cite{}| command \cite{lamport1994latex}. 

\section{Methodology}
In this section, we will discuss our methodology for conducting research and collecting data. We can use the \textit{enumerate} environment to list out the steps in our methodology:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the research question
    \item Conduct a literature review
    \item Design the study
    \item Collect data
    \item Analyze data
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}
Our results show a correlation between the variables X and Y. Here is an equation that represents this relationship:
\begin{equation}
    Y = mX + b
\end{equation}
Where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the intercept.

\section{Discussion}
We can use the \textit{figure} environment to insert images in our document. See Figure \ref{fig:example} for an example:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example.png}
    \caption{Example image}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

We can also add hyperlinks in our document using the \verb|\href{}{}| command. For example, check out \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{this website} for more information on \LaTeX.

\section{Conclusion}
We have demonstrated the versatility of \LaTeX~in creating professional documents with various elements such as equations, figures, and hyperlinks. This makes it a popular choice among researchers and academics.
