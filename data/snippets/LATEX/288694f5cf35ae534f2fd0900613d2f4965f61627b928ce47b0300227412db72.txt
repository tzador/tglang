\section{Introduction}
In this section, we will introduce the concepts of Latex and how it can be used to generate complex documents.

\subsection{Latex Basics}
Latex is a typesetting language used to create professional and aesthetically pleasing documents. It is widely used in the academic and scientific community due to its ability to handle complex equations and graphics.

\subsection{Document Structure}
A Latex document consists of a preamble and the document itself. The preamble contains commands that set the overall format and style of the document. The document body contains the actual content of the document.

\section{Packages}
Latex provides various packages that can be imported to extend its capabilities. Here are some commonly used packages:

\subsection{amsmath}
The amsmath package provides a myriad of mathematical symbols, formulas, and environments. It is essential for writing mathematical equations and proofs.

\subsection{graphicx}
The graphicx package allows for enhanced support for graphics in Latex documents. It provides commands for adding images, resizing and rotating them, and formatting captions.

\subsection{hyperref}
The hyperref package is used to add hyperlinks and URLs to your document. It allows for easy navigation between sections and references.

\section{Conclusion}
In this complex Latex code snippet, we have showcased the use of different packages and their importance in creating professional documents. With Latex, you can create complex and visually appealing documents with ease.
