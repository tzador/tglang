% This is a complex code snippet in LATEX
\documentclass{article} % declares the document class as 'article'
\usepackage{amsmath} % imports the package 'amsmath' for mathematical equations
\usepackage{graphicx} % imports the package 'graphicx' for including images
\begin{document} % begins the document

\title{Complex Code Snippet in LATEX} % sets the title of the document
\author{John Doe} % sets the author of the document

\section{Introduction} % starts a new section titled 'Introduction'
This is a complex code snippet that showcases the features of LATEX.

\section{Equations} % starts a new section titled 'Equations'

LATEX has a powerful built-in equation editor that allows for easy typesetting of mathematical expressions. Here is an example of a quadratic equation:
\begin{equation} % starts an equation environment
    ax^2 + bx + c = 0 % actual equation
\end{equation} % ends the equation environment

\section{Figures} % starts a new section titled 'Figures'

The 'graphicx' package allows for easy inclusion of figures in LATEX. Here is an example of including an image in the document:

\begin{figure}[h] % starts a figure environment with placement option 'h' for here
    \centering % centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} % includes the image named 'image.jpg' with 50% of the text width as its size
    \caption{Example Image} % sets a caption for the image
    \label{fig:example} % sets a label for referencing the figure
\end{figure} % ends the figure environment

Figure \ref{fig:example} shows an example of an image included in the document.

\section{Conclusion} % starts a new section titled 'Conclusion'

This complex code snippet demonstrated some of the powerful features of LATEX, including equation typesetting and figure inclusion. With LATEX, creating professional-looking documents is made easier and more efficient.
