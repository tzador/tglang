\subsection{Functions} % Starts a new subsection titled "Functions"
Here are some equations showcasing the power of \LaTeX's mathematical formatting:
\begin{align*} % Starts an aligned environment for equations
f(x) &= x^2 + 3x - 5 \\ % Prints the equation f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 5
g(x) &= \frac{1}{x^2 + 1} \\ % Prints the equation f(x) = 1/(x^2 + 1)
h(x) &= \sin{x} + \cos{x} % Prints the equation h(x) = sin(x) + cos(x)
\end{align*} % Ends the aligned environment
\section{Conclusion} % Starts a new section titled "Conclusion"
In conclusion, \LaTeX is a powerful tool for typesetting complex mathematical equations and documents. % Prints a sentence summarizing the power of \LaTeX
\end{document} % Ends the document
