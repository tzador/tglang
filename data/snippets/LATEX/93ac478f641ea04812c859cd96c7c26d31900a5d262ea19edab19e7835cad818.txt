\section{Introduction} %Creating a section titled 'Introduction'
This document is an example of a complex document in LATEX. We will use various packages and techniques to showcase the capabilities of LATEX.

\section{Mathematics}
LATEX is known for its superior typesetting of mathematical equations and symbols. We can include equations in-line $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ or in display mode:
\[ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \]

We can also use the \texttt{align} environment to align multiple equations:
\begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) &= \cos(x) \\
    \frac{d}{dx} \cos(x) &= -\sin(x)
\end{align}

\section{Figures}
We can easily include figures in our document using the \texttt{includegraphics} command:
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering %Centering the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg}
    \caption{Example figure} %Giving a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:example} %Setting a label for referencing the figure in the document
\end{figure}

\section{Code Snippets}
We can also include code snippets in our document using the \texttt{lstlisting} environment:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Example Python code] %Defining the language of the code and giving a caption
# This is a comment in Python
print("Hello world!") # Printing a message
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Conclusion}
LATEX is a powerful tool for creating complex documents with mathematical equations, figures and code snippets. With the help of various packages, we can customize our document to suit our needs.
