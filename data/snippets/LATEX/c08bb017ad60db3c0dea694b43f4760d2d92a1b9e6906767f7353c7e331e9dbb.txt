\LaTeX \, (pronounced "lay-tek") is a typesetting system and programming language that is often used for creating technical and scientific documents. It is known for its powerful equation typesetting capabilities, making it a popular choice among mathematicians, scientists, and engineers.

    \end{equation*} 
\subsection{Basic Syntax}        % Add another subsection heading
\LaTeX \, documents are written in plain text with commands that begin with a backslash (\textbackslash). These commands tell \LaTeX \, how to format the document. For example, the command \textbackslash documentclass\{article\} defines the type of document and the \textbraceleft article\textbraceright \, specifies the formatting options.
