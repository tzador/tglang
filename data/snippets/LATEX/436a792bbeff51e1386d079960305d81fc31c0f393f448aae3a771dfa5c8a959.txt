Welcome to my document! This is an example of a long and complex code snippet in LATEX.

\subsection{Motivation}

I was motivated to generate this code snippet by the challenge posed to me. I wanted to showcase my LATEX skills and impress the person asking for it.

\begin{thm}[Pythagorean Theorem] % begin theorem environment with automatic numbering and label
For a right triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse, we have $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. % theorem statement
\end{thm}

This theorem is commonly used in mathematics and physics, and is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras.

\subsection{Code}
