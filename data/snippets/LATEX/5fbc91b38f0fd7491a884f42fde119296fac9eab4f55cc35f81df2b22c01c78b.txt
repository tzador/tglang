\section{Introduction}

This is an example of a long and complex code snippet written in \LaTeX. In this section, we will discuss the different components of this snippet and what they do.

\subsection{Packages}

First, we include necessary packages such as \texttt{amsmath} for mathematical equations, \texttt{graphicx} for including images, and \texttt{listings} for code listings.

\subsection{Document Class}

Next, we specify the document class as \texttt{article}. This sets the basic formatting and layout of our document.

\subsection{Title and Author}

We then set the title and authors of our document using the \texttt{title} and \texttt{author} commands.

\section{Main Body}

The main body of our document is enclosed in the \texttt{document} environment. Here, we can begin writing our actual code snippet.

\subsection{Abstract}

We start with the abstract, which gives a brief overview of what our code snippet is about.

\subsection{Code Listing}

Next, we include our actual code listing using the \texttt{lstlisting} environment. This will display our code with line numbers and syntax highlighting.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, language=C++, caption=Example Code Snippet]
// This is a comment
#include <iostream>

int main() {

   // Print "Hello World!" to the console
   std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;

   return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Mathematical Equations}

We can also include mathematical equations in our snippet using the \texttt{align} environment from the \texttt{amsmath} package.

\begin{align}
    a^2 + b^2 &= c^2 \nonumber \\
    \int_0^{\infty} e^{-x}\,dx &= 1 \nonumber
\end{align}

\subsection{Images}

We can also include images in our snippet using the \texttt{includegraphics} command from the \texttt{graphicx} package. This will insert an image titled \textit{myimage.jpg} and will automatically resize it to fit the page.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{myimage.jpg}
    \caption{Example Image}
    \label{fig:image}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}

This concludes our long and complex code snippet written in \LaTeX. We have demonstrated how to include code listings, mathematical equations, and images in a single document. We hope this has been helpful in understanding how to write complex code snippets in \LaTeX.
