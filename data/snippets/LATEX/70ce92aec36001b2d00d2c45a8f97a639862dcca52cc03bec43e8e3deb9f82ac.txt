\documentclass{article}

% This document class sets the basic structure of the document, in this case it sets it as an article.

\title{A Complex Code Snippet in Latex} % Set the title of the document

\author{John Smith} % Set the author of the document

\date{\today} % Set the date to today's date

\begin{document} % Begin the document

\maketitle % Prints the title, author, and date set in the preamble

\section{Introduction} % Define a section titled "Introduction"

% This section will contain some complex code snippets and explanations, as per the requirements of the task.

\subsection{Basic Latex Commands} % Define a subsection within the "Introduction" section

% Here, we will use some basic Latex commands to format text and lists.

This is a \textbf{bold} sentence. % Use the \textbf{} command to make text bold

% Create a numbered list using the enumerate environment
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This is the first item.
    \item This is the second item.
    \item This is the third item.
\end{enumerate}

% Create a bulleted list using the itemize environment
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is the first item.
    \item This is the second item.
    \item This is the third item.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mathematical Formulas} % Define a subsection within the "Introduction" section to showcase mathematical formulas

% Latex has powerful tools for creating mathematical expressions and equations.

The Pythagorean Theorem can be written as $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.

We can also write complex mathematical expressions using Latex, such as $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$.

\section{Conclusion} % Define a section titled "Conclusion"

In this document, we have seen some examples of how to use basic Latex commands for text formatting and how to write complex mathematical formulas. Latex is a powerful tool for creating professional documents with complex mathematical content.
