Welcome to my example LATEX document! In this document, we will cover some of the key features of LATEX and how to use them. \\
This is a new paragraph with some text and a math equation:
\begin{equation}
    E = mc^{2}
\end{equation}
Here, $E$ represents energy, $m$ represents mass, and $c$ is the speed of light. \\
Now, let's include an image in our document:
\begin{figure}[h]    % options for placement (h stands for "here")
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg}
    \caption{Example image}
\end{figure}
% Hyperlinks
We can also create hyperlinks in our document using the \textit{hyperref} package. Check out my website \href{https://www.example.com}{here}! \\
% Conclusion
That's it for this introduction to LATEX. Stay tuned for more advanced topics.
