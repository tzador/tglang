\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction of our document. We will start by learning about the different document classes and packages that can be used in \LaTeX.

\section{Document Classes}
\LaTeX\ has different document classes to choose from, each with its own distinct features. We will be using the \texttt{article} class for our document. This class is suited for shorter documents such as articles, reports, and papers.

\section{Packages}
Packages are extensions that provide extra functionality to \LaTeX. We have already used the \texttt{geometry} package to adjust our page margins. Let's take a look at some more commonly used packages and their functions.

\subsection{Graphicx}
The \texttt{graphicx} package allows us to insert images into our document using the \texttt{includegraphics} command. 

\subsection{Amsmath}
The \texttt{amsmath} package provides additional math commands and symbols, making it easier to write and format equations in \LaTeX.

\subsection{Hyperref}
The \texttt{hyperref} package allows us to create hyperlinks within our document and make them clickable when viewing it in a digital format.

\section{Conclusion}
This concludes our workshop on \LaTeX. With the knowledge gained in this workshop, you can now start creating documents with \LaTeX.
