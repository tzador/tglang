\documentclass[12pt]{article} % This sets the document class to be an article with 12pt font size

\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry} % This sets the margin of the document to 1 inch

\usepackage{graphicx} % This package allows for the insertion of graphics in the document

\usepackage{amsmath} % This package provides additional math functionality and symbols

\begin{document} % This marks the beginning of the document

\title{My Complex LaTeX Code Snippet} % This creates a title for the document
\author{John Smith} % This sets the author of the document
\date{\today} % This sets the date of the document to be the current date

Here is an example of a complex equation in \LaTeX:
\begin{equation} % This begins an equation environment
    f(x) = \frac{1}{(x-1)^2} % This is the equation itself, which is a fraction with a superscript and subscript
\end{equation} % This ends the equation environment

This equation is just one of the many possibilities with \LaTeX's powerful math typesetting capabilities.
