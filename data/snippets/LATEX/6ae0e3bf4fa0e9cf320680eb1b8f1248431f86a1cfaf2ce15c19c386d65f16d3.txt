\section{Introduction}

This is an example of a complex and long code snippet in Latex. It includes various packages, settings, and commands to create a well-formatted document.

\section{Mathematical Expressions}

Latex is great for typesetting mathematical expressions. Here's an example:

\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^3}
\end{equation}

This equation prints as $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2} + \dfrac{1}{x^3}$.

\section{Including Images}

Latex can also include images in the document. Here's how:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.png} % adjust the width as needed
    \caption{Example Image}
    \label{fig:image}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:image} shows an example image included in the document.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, Latex is a powerful tool for producing well-formatted documents, especially with mathematical expressions and figures.
