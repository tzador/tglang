\section{Introduction}
Here is the introduction section of the document. 
We will be discussing the usage of Latex for document preparation.

\section{Methodology}
In this section, we will outline the steps taken to generate our document.
First, we need to define our variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $x$: This represents the input data.
    \item $y$: This represents the output data.
\end{itemize}

Next, we will use the formula $y = mx + b$ to calculate the output data.
Here, \textit{m} and \textit{b} are constants.

\subsection{Data Collection}
We collected our data by sampling from various sources.
This process was repeated multiple times to ensure accuracy.

\subsection{Data Processing}
Our data was then pre-processed to remove any outliers and irrelevant information.
This step included filtering, scaling, and normalization.

\subsection{Training}
The processed data was then used to train our model.
We used the \textit{scikit-learn} library for this task.

\subsection{Evaluation}
To evaluate our model, we used various performance metrics such as mean squared error and accuracy.

\section{Results}
After training and evaluating our model, we obtained the following results:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Value} \\
    \hline
    Mean Squared Error & 4.67 \\
    \hline
    Accuracy & 92\% \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}%

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, Latex is a powerful tool for document preparation and is widely used in the scientific community.
It allows for precise formatting and automation of tasks, making it an essential tool for researchers and academics.
