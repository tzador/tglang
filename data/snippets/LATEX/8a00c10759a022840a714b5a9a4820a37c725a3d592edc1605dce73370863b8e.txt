\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
LATEX is a document preparation system and markup language used for creating professional-looking documents, such as academic papers, reports, and presentations. It sets itself apart from other word processing software by its ability to produce high-quality typesetting and complex mathematical equations.

In this code snippet, we will go over some of the key features and commands in LATEX that are commonly used in document preparation.

%Creating a section with a title, label and content

\section{Document Structure}
\label{sec:structure}
A LATEX document typically starts with a document class declaration which defines the type of document being created. In this case, we have chosen the \texttt{article} class.

Next, we load the necessary packages using the \verb|\usepackage{}| command. These packages add extra functionality and customization options to our document.

After the preamble, we start the document using the \verb|\begin{document}| and end it with \verb|\end{document}|.

%Creating a numbered section with a title, label and content

\section{Creating Lists}
\label{sec:lists}
Lists in LATEX are created using the \verb|itemize| and \verb|enumerate| environments. The \verb|itemize| environment creates an unordered list while the \verb|enumerate| environment creates a numbered list.

\begin{itemize}
\item This is the first item in our list
\item This is the second item in our list
\item This is the third item in our list
\end{itemize}

%Creating an unnumbered section with a title, label and content

\section*{Mathematics}
\label{sec:math}
LATEX is widely used in the scientific community due to its ability to produce complex mathematical equations. The \verb|amsmath| package offers various commands for creating equations and aligning them.

\begin{align*}
(x+y)^2 &= (x+y)(x+y) \\
&= x^2+xy+xy+y^2 \\
&= x^2+2xy+y^2
\end{align*}

%Embedding a figure with a caption and label

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image}
\caption{This is an example figure.}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

%Referencing our sections and figure using their labels

As we can see in section \ref{sec:intro}, LATEX is a powerful tool for creating professional documents. In section \ref{sec:structure}, we discussed the basic structure of a LATEX document. In section \ref{sec:lists}, we went over the ways to create lists in LATEX and in section \ref{sec:math}, we showed how mathematical equations can be created using the \verb|amsmath| package. Lastly, in Figure \ref{fig:example}, we see an example of how to embed a figure with a caption and label.
