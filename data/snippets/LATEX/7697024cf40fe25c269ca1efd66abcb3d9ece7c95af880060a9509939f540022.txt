\maketitle

This is my first document written in {\LaTeX}.

\section{Introduction}

Here is a simple equation: 

\begin{equation}
    y = mx + b
\end{equation}

where $y$ is the dependent variable, $m$ is the slope, $x$ is the independent variable, and $b$ is the y-intercept.

\subsection{Images}

We can include images in our document like this: 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image}
    \caption{Example Image}
    \label{fig:example_image}
\end{figure}

We can also refer to this image in our text by using its label: Figure \ref{fig:example_image}. 

\section{Conclusion}

This is just a simple example of a {\LaTeX} document. There are many more things you can do with this powerful typesetting language.
