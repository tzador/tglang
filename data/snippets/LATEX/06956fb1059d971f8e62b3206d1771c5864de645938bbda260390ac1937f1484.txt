% Begin main body
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% This section introduces the purpose of the code snippet
The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate the features and capabilities of \LaTeX. This section (\ref{sec:intro}) shows how to create section headings and labels that can be referenced throughout the document.

\subsection{Packages}
% This subsection lists some of the packages used in the code snippet

% Package for graphics
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{graphicx}: for including graphics in the document
  \item \texttt{caption}: for customizing captions for figures and tables
  \item \texttt{hyperref}: for adding hyperlinks and bookmarks in the document
  \item \texttt{listings}: for including source code listings
\end{itemize}

% Package for formatting
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{titlesec}: for customizing section and chapter headings
  \item \texttt{fancyhdr}: for creating custom headers and footers
\end{itemize}

% Package for tables
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{booktabs}: for creating professional looking tables
  \item \texttt{longtable}: for creating tables that span multiple pages
\end{itemize}

% Package for bibliography
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{biblatex}: for managing bibliographic references and citations
  \item \texttt{hyperref}: for creating clickable links in the bibliography
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
% This subsection demonstrates the use of equations in \LaTeX

% Use equation environment
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:emc}
  E = mc^2
\end{equation}

% Use align environment for multiple equations
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:pythagoras}
  a^2 + b^2 &= c^2 \\
  \label{eq:sine}
  \sin^2x + \cos^2x &= 1
\end{align}

% Use gather environment for unnumbered equations
\begin{gather*}
  F = m \ddot{x} \\
  f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx)
\end{gather*}

% Referencing equations
You can reference equations using their labels, such as Equation \ref{eq:emc} and Equation \ref{eq:pythagoras}. You can also use the \texttt{amsmath} package's \texttt{eqref} command, which will automatically insert parentheses around the equation number, like so: \eqref{eq:sine}.

\section{Code Snippet}
% This section contains a sample code snippet

% Use listings package for source code formatting and highlighting
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption={Sample Code Snippet}]
// Define variables
int num1 = 5, num2 = 10, sum;

// Calculate sum
sum = num1 + num2;

// Print result
System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
\end{lstlisting}

% Referencing code snippets
You can reference code snippets using the \texttt{label} and \texttt{ref} commands, like so: Listing \ref{lst:sample}.

\section{Conclusion}
% This section concludes the code snippet and provides a final thought

In conclusion, this complex code snippet has demonstrated the powerful capabilities of \LaTeX, including its use of packages, equations, and code listings. With its precise typesetting and organizational structure, \LaTeX is the perfect choice for creating professional documents.
