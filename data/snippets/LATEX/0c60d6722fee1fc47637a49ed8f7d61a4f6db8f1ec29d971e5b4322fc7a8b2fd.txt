% Section: Introduction
\section{Introduction}
This code snippet is written in \LaTeX, a typesetting language often used for academic documents. It showcases various packages and commands that can be used to create complex mathematical equations and symbols.

% Section: Equations
\section{Equations}
Here we will use the \texttt{equation} environment to write some equations:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_{0}^{x} f(t)\,dt \right) = f(x)
\end{equation}
The \texttt{frac} command is used to create a fraction, while the \texttt{int} command is used to create an integral. The \texttt{bm} package is used to make the variable $x$ bold in the equation.

We can also use the \texttt{align} environment to write multiple equations and align them at a certain point, such as the equal sign:
\begin{align}
    \sin (x+y) &= \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y \\
    \cos (x+y) &= \cos x \cos y - \sin x \sin y
\end{align}

% Section: Figures
\section{Figures}
We can also include graphics in our document using the \texttt{figure} environment. Here is an example of how to insert an image:
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{example_image.png}
    \caption{This is an example image.}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}
The \texttt{centering} command centers the image, while the \texttt{includegraphics} command is used to insert the image file. The \texttt{caption} command creates a caption for the image and the \texttt{label} command allows us to refer to the figure later in the text.

% Section: Conclusion
\section{Conclusion}
This is just a brief overview of the various commands and packages that can be used in \LaTeX to create complex and professional-looking documents. There are many more features and options available, making \LaTeX a popular choice for typesetting in various fields.
