% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
This is a complex code snippet written in \LaTeX. It uses multiple packages such as \texttt{lipsum} for placeholder text, \texttt{graphicx} for including images, and \texttt{amsmath} for mathematical formulas.

\section{Introduction}

Welcome to my complex code snippet! In this section, we will be discussing the various packages and commands used to create this document.

% Subsection
\subsection{Input Encoding}

As \LaTeX uses ASCII encoding by default, we need to include the \texttt{inputenc} package to handle special characters such as é and ä. We specify the UTF-8 encoding with the option \texttt{utf8}.

% Subsection
\subsection{Font Encoding}

In order to use non-ASCII characters in the PDF output, we also need to include the \texttt{fontenc} package with the option \texttt{T1}. This allows us to use accented characters in our document.

% Subsection
\subsection{Placeholder Text}

To demonstrate the use of the \texttt{lipsum} package, we will be inserting a few paragraphs of placeholder text using the command \texttt{\textbackslash{}lipsum}. This is useful for creating sample documents without having to write actual content.

% Subsection
\subsection{Including Images}

We can use the \texttt{graphicx} package to include images in our document. First, we need to specify the graphics extension we will be using with the command \texttt{\textbackslash{}DeclareGraphicsExtensions}. Then, we can insert the image using the \texttt{\textbackslash{}includegraphics} command, along with its file path and optional arguments such as resizing or rotating.

% Subsection
\subsection{Math Formulas}

As \LaTeX is commonly used for typesetting math, we will also include a few mathematical formulas using the \texttt{amsmath} package. This allows us to use commands such as \texttt{\textbackslash{}frac} for fractions, \texttt{\textbackslash{}sum} for sums, and \texttt{\textbackslash{}int} for integrals.
