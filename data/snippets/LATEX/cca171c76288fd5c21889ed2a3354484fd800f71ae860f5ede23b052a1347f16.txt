\begin{document}

\maketitle % This command inserts the title and author information we provided above

\section{Introduction} % This command creates a new section titled "Introduction"

Hello world! This is my first document in \LaTeX. % This is a simple text

\subsection{Mathematics} % This command creates a subsection titled "Mathematics"

In this document, we will explore some basic mathematical formulas and equations.

\subsubsection{Pythagorean Theorem} % This command creates a subsubsection titled "Pythagorean Theorem"

The Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as the following equation:

\begin{equation*} % This command creates an unnumbered equation
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 % This is the actual equation
\end{equation*}

where $a$ and $b$ are the perpendicular sides of a right triangle, and $c$ is the hypotenuse.

\subsubsection{Quadratic Formula} % This command creates another subsubsection titled "Quadratic Formula"

We can also solve for unknown variables using the quadratic formula:

\begin{equation} % This command creates a numbered equation
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} % This is the actual equation
\end{equation}

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are coefficients and $x$ is the variable.

Some other useful math environments provided by the \texttt{amsmath} package include \texttt{align}, \texttt{gather}, and \texttt{cases}. % This is some additional information about math environments

\section{Conclusion}

That concludes our brief introduction to \LaTeX. It is a powerful typesetting language with many useful features for creating documents with complex mathematical content. % This is the conclusion of our document

% Comment +amp; symbol is used in \LaTeX to escape special characters, so we use \texttt{amp} instead to avoid errors.
