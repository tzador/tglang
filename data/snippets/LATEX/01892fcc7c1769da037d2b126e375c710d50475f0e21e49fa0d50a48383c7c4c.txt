    This is a long and complex document created with LaTeX. It includes various formatting, equations, and images.
\end{abstract}

% Introduction section
\section{Introduction}
This document will showcase the capabilities of LaTeX in creating complex documents. It will include formatting of text, equations, and images.

% Text formatting
\subsection{Formatting Text}
\textbf{This text} is in bold, \textit{this text} is in italics, \underline{this text} is underlined, and \texttt{this text} is in typewriter font.

% Equations
\subsection{Equations}
LaTeX makes it easy to write complex equations. For example, the quadratic formula can be written as:
\begin{equation} % the "equation" environment is used for numbered equations
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}

% Images
\subsection{Images}
LaTeX also makes it easy to include images in the document. The following code will include an image titled "example", with a width of 0.5 times the text width and a caption that says "This is an example image".
\begin{figure}[h] % the "figure" environment is used for including images
    \centering % images are centered by default
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example}
    \caption{This is an example image}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

% Conclusion
\section{Conclusion}
LaTeX is a powerful tool for creating complex documents with various formatting, equations, and images. It is widely used in academia and can produce professional-looking documents.
