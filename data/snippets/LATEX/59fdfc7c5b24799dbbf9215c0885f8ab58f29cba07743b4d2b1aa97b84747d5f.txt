\section{Introduction} %start first section
This is a demonstration of a complex code snippet in \LaTeX. It includes different packages and commands to showcase the capabilities of the language.

\section{Mathematics} %start second section
\subsection{Equations} %start subsection
We can write mathematical equations in \LaTeX, such as the famous equation $E=mc^2$. %use $...$ to display inline math

We can also display equations in a separate line using the \textit{equation} environment:
\begin{equation} %start of equation
    \int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a) %write equation
\end{equation}
Where $F(x)$ is the antiderivative of $f(x)$.

\subsection{Matrices} %start subsection
Matrices can also be easily created in \LaTeX. We can write a 3x3 matrix using the \textit{bmatrix} environment:
\begin{equation} %start of equation
    \begin{bmatrix} %start of matrix
    1 & 2 & 3 \\ %row 1
    4 & 5 & 6 \\ %row 2
    7 & 8 & 9 %row 3
    \end{bmatrix} %end of matrix
\end{equation}

\section{Graphics} %start third section
We can include graphics in our document using the \textit{graphicx} package. Here is an example:

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image} %include image with width of half the text width

\section{Links} %start fourth section
We can create clickable links in our document using the \textit{hyperref} package. Here is an example:
\href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes}{Learn \LaTeX{} in 30 minutes} %create link with given text and URL

\section{Conclusion} %start final section
This concludes our demonstration of a complex code snippet in \LaTeX. There are many more features and packages that can be explored to create even more complex documents. %write conclusion and end document
