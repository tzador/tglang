\noindent % removes indentation from this line
{\Large \textbf{Introduction}} \\ % sets the font size to large and bold for the section title
This is the introduction of my document. It will provide some background information and an overview of the contents. % adds a line of text

\section{Methodology} % creates a new section titled 'Methodology'
First, we will define the variables used in our study. Let $x$ represent the independent variable, and $y$ represent the dependent variable. % adds a line of text and introduces math notation

Next, we will describe the procedures for collecting and analyzing data. % adds another line of text

\subsection{Data Collection} % creates a subsection titled 'Data Collection'
We will collect data through surveys and interviews with participants. % adds a line of text

\subsection{Data Analysis}
The collected data will be analyzed using statistical methods. % adds another line of text

\section{Results}
The results of our study are presented in this section. % adds a line of text 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering % centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{data_graph.png} % inserts the image 'data_graph' with a width of half the text width
    \caption{Graph of Data} % adds a caption for the figure
    \label{fig:data_graph} % adds a label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:data_graph}, there is a positive correlation between variables $x$ and $y$. % references the figure using the label defined earlier and adds a line of text

\section{Discussion}
In this section, we will discuss the implications of our results and make connections to previous research. % adds a line of text

\subsection{Limitations}
One limitation of our study is the small sample size. % adds a line of text

\subsection{Future Directions}
Future studies can explore other variables that may affect the relationship between $x$ and $y$. % adds another line of text

\section{Conclusion}
To conclude, our study confirms the positive relationship between variables $x$ and $y$. Further research is needed to fully understand this relationship. % adds a line of text

% add references section if necessary
