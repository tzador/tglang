\documentclass{article} % Specifies the document class
\usepackage{amsmath} % Imports math symbols and formatting

\begin{document} % Begins the document

\title{Example LATEX Code} % Adds a title to the document
\author{John Smith} % Adds an author to the document
\date{\today} % Adds the current date to the document

\maketitle % Creates the title page with the given information

\section{Introduction} % Adds a section with the given title
Welcome to my example code snippet in \LaTeX{}! This is a powerful typesetting language that is commonly used for writing scientific and mathematical documents. This code will showcase some of the basic features and syntax of \LaTeX{}.

\subsection{Equations} % Adds a subsection with the given title
One of the main strengths of \LaTeX{} is its ability to easily typeset mathematical equations. Here is an example of the quadratic formula:
\begin{equation} % Begins an equation environment
    x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} % Styles and typesets the equation
\end{equation}
This equation is centered and automatically numbered. For more complex equations, the \verb|align| environment can be used for multi-line equations.

\subsection{Figures} % Adds another subsection
Including figures in your document is also straightforward in \LaTeX{}. Here is an example of including and captioning a figure:
\begin{figure}[h] % Begins a figure environment
    \centering % Centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figure.png} % Includes the image with a width of 50% of the text width
    \caption{Example figure caption.} % Adds a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:example} % Adds a label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}

\subsection{Lists} % Adds a third subsection
Lists can also be easily created in \LaTeX{}. Here is an example of an itemized list:
\begin{itemize} % Begins an itemize environment
    \item First item
    \item Second item
    \item Third item
\end{itemize}
And here is an example of a numbered list:
\begin{enumerate} % Begins an enumerate environment
    \item First item
    \item Second item
    \item Third item
\end{enumerate}

\end{document} % End of the document
