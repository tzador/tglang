This is a sample document created using \LaTeX{} for demonstrating its features. %prints text in the document

\subsection{Equations} %creates a subsection titled "Equations"

This document showcases various mathematical equations using the \textit{amsmath} package. %prints text in the document

Some examples are:

\begin{equation} %begins an equation environment
    f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 %prints an equation
\end{equation} %ends the equation environment

\begin{equation} %begins an equation environment
    \frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x}f(t)\,dt \right) = f(x) %prints an equation
    \label{eq:derivative} %adds a label for referencing later
\end{equation} %ends the equation environment

Equation \ref{eq:derivative} is the fundamental theorem of calculus, which relates differentiation and integration. %prints text in the document and references the labeled equation
