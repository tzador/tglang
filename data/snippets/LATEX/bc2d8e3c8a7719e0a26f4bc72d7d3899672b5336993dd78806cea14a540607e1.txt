\documentclass{article} 
% specifies the documentclass as 'article' 

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} 
% sets the input encoding to UTF-8 

\usepackage{amsmath} 
% imports the American Mathematical Society (AMS) math package 

\usepackage{hyperref} 
% imports the hypertext package 

\begin{document} 
% starts the document environment 

\section{Introduction} 
% creates a section titled 'Introduction' 

This is a long and complex code snippet in \LaTeX. 
% prints a sentence using \LaTeX macro for the LaTeX logo 

\subsection{Main Body} 
% creates a subsection titled 'Main Body' 

The following equation demonstrates the power of the \texttt{amsmath} package: 

\begin{equation} 
% starts an equation environment 
    E=mc^2 
% prints the famous equation from Einstein's theory of relativity 
\end{equation} 

Now let's add some complexity by using the \texttt{align} environment: 

\begin{align} 
% starts an align environment, allowing multiple equations to be aligned 
    \sum_{n=1}^{N} n^2 &= \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} \\ 
    % prints a summation equation 
    F(x) &= \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx 
    % prints an integral equation 
\end{align} 

As you can see, \LaTeX{} allows for easy formatting of complex mathematical equations.

\section{Conclusion} 
% creates a section titled 'Conclusion' 

This code snippet is just a small glimpse into the capabilities of \LaTeX{} for typesetting complex documents.
