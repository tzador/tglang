\section{Introduction} 

This is an example of a document using \LaTeX. 
\LaTeX \ is a typesetting language designed for producing scientific and technical documents. 
It allows for precise control over layout and formatting, making it a popular choice for academics and researchers. 

\lipsum[1-3] 
% This inserts 3 paragraphs of random text 

\section{Methods} 

In this section, we will discuss our methods for conducting the experiment. 
We used a randomized controlled design with a sample size of 100 participants. 

\subsection{Participants} 

Our participants were recruited from a local university and were between the ages of 18 and 30. 

\subsection{Materials} 

We used a computer program to present stimuli and record responses. 
The program was written in Python and integrated with \LaTeX \ using the \textit{minted} package. 

\section{Results} 

Our results showed a significant difference between the experimental and control groups (\textit{t} = 2.34, \textit{p} < .05). 

\section{Discussion} 

Based on our results, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that our experimental manipulation had an effect on participant behavior. 
Further studies with larger sample sizes may provide more insight into the underlying mechanisms.
