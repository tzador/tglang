This is my complex code that utilizes different packages and features in LaTeX.

\section{Introduction} % Creates a new section
In this section, I will discuss the different packages and features that I have used in creating this code snippet.

\subsection{Input Encoding} % Creates a sub-section
The first package that I have used is \verb|inputenc| which allows me to specify the input encoding as UTF-8. This ensures that my code can handle Unicode characters.

\subsection{Images} % Creates another sub-section
I have also used the \verb|graphicx| package which enables me to include images in my document. This can be done with the \verb|includegraphics| command.

\subsection{Mathematical Notation} % Creates another sub-section
To enhance the mathematical notation, I have used the \verb|amsmath| package. This allows me to use advanced mathematical symbols and equations.

\subsection{Hyperlinks} % Creates another sub-section
The last package that I have used is \verb|hyperref| which allows me to add hyperlinks to my document. I can use the \verb|hyperlink| command to create clickable links.
