Latex is a typesetting language commonly used for scientific documents, due to its ability to handle complex mathematical equations. In this document, we will explore some of its features and learn how to create a basic document.

\subsection{Math Equations} % creates a subsection within the "Introduction" section
One of the major advantages of Latex is its ability to easily handle complex math equations. For example, we can create the famous Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation, $E=mc^2$, using the \verb|equation| environment:
