% Using environment for theorem
\begin{theorem}{For any positive integer $n$, $n^2$ is even}{1} % arguments for theorem name and number
    Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n$ can be written as $2k$ for some integer $k$ by definition of even numbers since every even number is divisible by $2$. Thus, $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$. Since $k$ is also an integer, $4k^2$ is even by definition. Therefore, $n^2$ is even.
\end{theorem}

% Using custom command for matrix
Let $A$ be a matrix of size $m \times n$, represented as \mymatrix{A}{n}. Then, the $(i,j)$th element of $A$ is denoted as $A_{ij}$.
