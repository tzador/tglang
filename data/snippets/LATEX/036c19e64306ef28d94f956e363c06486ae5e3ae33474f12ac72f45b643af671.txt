\section{Introduction}
This is an example of a long and complex code snippet in Latex. It includes multiple packages and commands for formatting and typesetting mathematical equations.

\subsection{Equations}
For example, we can create a simple equation using the \verb|\begin{equation}| and \verb|\end{equation}| commands:
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2
\end{equation}

We can also align multiple equations using the \verb|align| environment:
\begin{align}
    f(x) &= x^2 + 3x + 2 \\
    g(x) &= \sqrt{x} \\
    h(x) &= \int_{0}^{1} x^2 \text{d}x
\end{align}

\subsection{Symbols and Notations}
Latex has a wide range of symbols and notations for mathematical expressions. We can use the \verb|\frac| command to create fractions, and the \verb|\sum| and \verb|\prod| commands for summation and product symbols:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i}{\prod_{j=1}^{m} y_j}
\end{equation}

We can also use the \verb|\left| and \verb|\right| commands to adjust the size of parentheses according to the content inside them:
\begin{equation}
    \left( \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i}{\prod_{j=1}^{m} y_j} \right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Matrices and Vectors}
The \verb|amsmath| package also includes commands for creating matrices and vectors:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 \\
    4 & 5 & 6 \\ 
    7 & 8 & 9
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Referencing}
We can use the \verb|\label| and \verb|\ref| commands to add and reference labels for equations and sections:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:example}
    y = mx + c
\end{equation}

Equation (\ref{eq:example}) is a simple linear equation.

\section{Conclusion}
This was just a small glimpse into the world of Latex for mathematical typesetting. With its extensive range of packages, commands, and symbols, Latex is a powerful tool for creating professional and complex equations.
