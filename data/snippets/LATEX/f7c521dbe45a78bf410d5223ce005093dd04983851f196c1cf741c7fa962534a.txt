    % Introduction - Provides an overview of the document and its purpose
    \section{Introduction}
    LaTeX is a popular typesetting tool used for creating high quality documents. It is often used in academia for writing research papers, reports, and articles. In this tutorial, I will be showing you how to create a basic document using LaTeX.
    
    % Main body - Contains the content of the document
    \section{Methods}
    To create a document in LaTeX, we use the predetermined structure of \textit{preamble}, \textit{begin}, and \textit{end}. The preamble is where we load any necessary packages and define new commands, such as the \helloworld command we defined earlier. The \textit{begin} and \textit{end} tags enclose the main content of the document.
    
    % Subsections - Subdivisions of the main body section
    \subsection{Inputting Text}
    We can input text by simply typing it in between the \textit{begin} and \textit{end} tags. For example, to print \helloworld, we can type \textbackslash helloworld in the document body.
    
    \subsection{Formatting Options}
    LaTeX also provides various formatting options for our text, such as \textbf{bold}, \textit{italics}, \underline{underlining}, and \texttt{typewriter font}. These can be used by enclosing the text in the appropriate commands.
    
    \subsection{Including Images}
    We can also include images in our document using the graphicx package we loaded in the preamble. We can use the \textit{includegraphics} command with the file path of the image. For example, \textbackslash includegraphics\{image.jpg\} will include the image.jpg file in the document.
    
    % Conclusion - Summarizes the main points of the document
    \section{Conclusion}
    In this tutorial, we learned how to create a basic document using LaTeX. We explored various features such as inputting text, formatting options, and including images. With practice and further understanding, you can create more complex and professional-looking documents in LaTeX.
