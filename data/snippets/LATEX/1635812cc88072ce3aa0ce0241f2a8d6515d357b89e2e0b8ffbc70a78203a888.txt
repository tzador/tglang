\textbf{Main Theorem:}
Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A$ is a subset of $B$
    \item Every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$
    \item $A \cap B = A$
\end{enumerate}

\textit{Proof:}
($1 \implies 2$) Assume $A \subseteq B$, and let $x \in A$. Then $x \in B$ by definition of subset.\\
($2 \implies 3$) Assume every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, and let $x \in A \cap B$. Then $x \in A$ and $x \in B$ by definition of intersection. Therefore, $A \cap B \subseteq A$.\\
($3 \implies 1$) Assume $A \cap B = A$, and let $x \in A$. Then $x \in A$ and $x \in B$ by definition of intersection. Therefore, $A \subseteq B$.\\
Therefore, $A$ is a subset of $B$ if and only if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, if and only if $A \cap B = A$. \qed
