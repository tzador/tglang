\begin{document} % Begins document

\maketitle % Generates title based on information provided above

\section{Introduction} % Creates new section titled 'Introduction'
This is a long and complex document that will showcase the use of various LaTeX commands and packages. It will also demonstrate the power and flexibility of LaTeX in typesetting.

\subsection{Purpose} % Creates subsection titled 'Purpose'
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive example of how to create a document using LaTeX and its various features.

\subsection{Target Audience} % Creates subsection titled 'Target Audience'
The target audience for this document is anyone interested in learning how to use LaTeX for creating professional documents.

\section{The Basics} % Creates new section titled 'The Basics'
In this section, we will cover the basic elements of LaTeX such as text formatting, lists, and equations.

\subsection{Text Formatting} % Creates subsection titled 'Text Formatting'
LaTeX provides various commands for formatting text such as \textit{italics}, \textbf{bold}, and \underline{underlined}. We can also \textit{\textbf{\underline{combine}}} these commands to create complex formatting.

\subsection{Lists} % Creates subsection titled 'Lists'
There are two types of lists in LaTeX: \textbf{ordered} and \textbf{unordered}. Ordered lists are numbered while unordered lists use bullet points. Below is an example of an ordered list:
\begin{enumerate} % Begins numbered list
    \item First item
    \item Second item
    \item Third item
\end{enumerate} % Ends numbered list

\subsection{Equations} % Creates subsection titled 'Equations'
LaTeX is widely used in the scientific community due to its ability to typeset complex equations. We can use the \texttt{equation} environment to create numbered equations. For example, the famous \textit{Euler's identity}:
\begin{equation} % Begins numbered equation
    e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
\end{equation} % Ends numbered equation

\section{Advanced Features} % Creates new section titled 'Advanced Features'
Apart from the basics, LaTeX also offers many advanced features such as tables, figures, and references.

\subsection{Tables} % Creates subsection titled 'Tables'
Tables in LaTeX can be created using the \texttt{tabular} environment. We can specify the number of columns and the alignment of the content. Below is an example of a simple table:
\begin{table}[h] % Begins table with placement 'here'
    \centering % Centers the table
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} % Specifies 3 columns with center alignment and vertical lines between them
        \hline % Horizontal line
        \textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} & \textbf{Column 3} \\ % Column headers
        \hline
        1 & 2 & 3 \\ % Row 1
        4 & 5 & 6 \\ % Row 2
        7 & 8 & 9 \\ % Row 3
        \hline
    \end{tabular} % Ends table
    \caption{A Simple Table} % Adds caption to the table
    \label{tab:sample} % Sets label for referencing
\end{table} % Ends table

\subsection{Figures} % Creates subsection titled 'Figures'
Figures in LaTeX can be included using the \texttt{includegraphics} command from the \texttt{graphicx} package. We can also add captions and labels to refer to them. Below is an example of a figure:
\begin{figure}[h] % Begins figure with placement 'here'
    \centering % Centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg} % Includes the image and specifies its width
    \caption{A Sample Figure} % Adds caption to the figure
    \label{fig:sample} % Sets label for referencing
\end{figure} % Ends figure

\subsection{References} % Creates subsection titled 'References'
One of the most useful features of LaTeX is its ability to automatically generate references. We can use the \texttt{label} and \texttt{ref} commands to refer to sections, equations, tables, and figures. For example, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we will discuss the conclusion of this document.

\section{Conclusion} % Creates new section titled 'Conclusion'
\label{sec:conclusion} % Sets label for section
In this document, we have covered various features of LaTeX, including text formatting, lists, equations, tables, figures, and references. This just scratches the surface of what LaTeX is capable of. With its vast collection of packages and customization options, LaTeX remains the go-to tool for creating professional documents in various fields.
