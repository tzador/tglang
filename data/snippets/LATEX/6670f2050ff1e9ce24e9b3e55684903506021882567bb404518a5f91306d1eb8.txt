\section{Introduction} % Begins a new section

This is my first document in \LaTeX{} and I'm excited to learn more about it. % Prints text

\subsection{Motivation} % Begins a subsection

I have heard a lot about \LaTeX{}'s capabilities in creating professional-looking documents and I wanted to give it a try.

\begin{equation*} % Begins a mathematical equation without a numbered label
    f(x) = \int_0^x \sin{(x)} \,dx % Defines the equation and its integral as an example
\end{equation*}

\section{Body} % Begins another section

In this section, I will experiment with different features of \LaTeX{}.

\subsection{Lists} % Begins a subsection

\LaTeX{} has three main types of lists:

\begin{itemize} % Begins an unordered list
    \item Bullets
    \item Dashes
    \item Asterisks
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate} % Begins an ordered list
    \item First item
    \item Second item
    \item Third item
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tables} % Begins another subsection

\LaTeX{} has great capabilities in creating tables:

\begin{table}[h] % Begins a table in the current position on the page
    \centering % Centers the table
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} % Defines the table columns and alignment
        \hline % Horizontal line
        \textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} & \textbf{Column 3} \\ % Table headers
        \hline
        Value 1 & Value 2 & Value 3 \\ % Table cells
        \hline
        Value 4 & Value 5 & Value 6 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Example Table} % Adds a caption to the table
\end{table}

\section{Conclusion} % Begins another section

I have only scratched the surface of \LaTeX{} in this document, but I can already see its potential in creating professional and organized documents. I look forward to learning more about it.
