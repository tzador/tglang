\documentclass{article} %this is the document class, defines the type of document we are creating
\usepackage{amsmath} %this package allows us to use mathematical equations
\usepackage{graphicx} %this package allows us to include images in our document

\begin{document} %beginning of document environment

\title{My Complex LaTeX Code} %specifying the title of our document
\author{John Doe} %specifying the author of our document
\date{\today} %specifying the date, in this case it will be the current date

\maketitle %prints the title, author, and date on the document

\section{Introduction} %creating a new section for our document
This is a long and complex code snippet in LaTeX. We will be using various commands and packages to create a visually pleasing and informative document.

\section{Equations} %creating another section
We can use the \verb|\begin{equation}| environment to write mathematical equations in LaTeX. For example, we can write the famous Pythagorean theorem as:
\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}
We can also use the \verb|\begin{align}| environment to align multiple equations and use the \verb|\label| command to label them for future reference. For example, we can write the equations for distance, speed, and time in terms of each other as:
\begin{align}
d &= st \label{eq:distance}\\ %labeling this equation as distance
s &= \frac{d}{t} \label{eq:speed}\\ %labeling this equation as speed
t &= \frac{d}{s} \label{eq:time} %labeling this equation as time
\end{align}

\section{Figures} %creating another section
We can use the \verb|\includegraphics| command to include images in our document. For example, we can include an image of the famous painting "The Starry Night" by Vincent van Gogh:
\begin{figure}[h] %the [h] ensures that the figure is placed 'here'
	\centering %centers the image
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{starry_night.jpg} %specifying the width of the image and the file name
	\caption{The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh} %adding a caption for our image
	\label{fig:starrynight} %labeling the figure for future reference
\end{figure}

\section{Tables} %creating another section
We can use the \verb|\begin{table}| environment to create tables in LaTeX. For example, we can create a table showing the ranking of countries by GDP per capita:
\begin{table}[h] %the [h] ensures that the table is placed 'here'
\centering %centers the table
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} %specifying the columns and their alignment
\hline %creates a horizontal line
\textbf{Country} & \textbf{GDP per capita} \\ %specifying the column headers
\hline %creates another horizontal line
Qatar & \$130,475 \\
Luxembourg & \$105,280 \\
Singapore & \$98,257 \\
... & ...\\
\hline %creates another horizontal line
\end{tabular}
\caption{Top 10 Countries by GDP per capita} %adding a caption for our table
\label{tab:gdp} %labeling the table for future reference
\end{table}

\section{Conclusion} %creating another section
This was just a small glimpse into the world of LaTeX. It is a powerful and versatile typesetting language that can be used to create professional and elegant documents. With practice, one can create even more complex and impressive documents using various packages and commands.
