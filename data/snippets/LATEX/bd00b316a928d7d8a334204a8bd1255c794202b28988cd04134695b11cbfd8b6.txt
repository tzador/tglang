\section{Introduction} %creates a section with the title "Introduction"
This is a complex Latex code that showcases the use of various packages and commands.

\section{Equations}
We can use the \textit{equation} environment to write mathematical expressions in Latex. For example, the equation for the Pythagorean theorem can be written as:
\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}

We can also use the \textit{align} environment to write multiple equations with proper alignment. For example:
\begin{align}
F(x) &= \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx \\
     &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{b-a}{n} f(x_i)
\end{align}

\section{Tables}
Latex also provides the \textit{tabular} environment for creating tables. We can specify the alignment and borders of the table as follows:
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{| c | l | r |} %specifies 3 columns with left, center and right alignment
    \hline
    \textbf{No.} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Age} \\ %add headers to the table
    \hline
    1 & John & 25 \\ %add data to the table
    2 & Jane & 22 \\
    3 & Mike & 28 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{A Sample Table} %adds a caption to the table
    \label{tab:sample} %assigns a label for cross-referencing
\end{table}

We can then refer to this table using its label, such as Table~\ref{tab:sample}.

\section{Figures}
To include figures in a Latex document, we can use the \textit{figure} environment and the \textbackslash includegraphics command. For example:
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image.jpg} %specifies the width of the image and includes the file "example-image" with the extension ".jpg"
    \caption{An Example Image} %adds a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:example} %assigns a label for cross-referencing
\end{figure}

We can then refer to this figure using its label, such as Figure~\ref{fig:example}.

\section{Conclusion}
By using Latex, we can create complex documents with ease and customize them as per our needs. It offers a wide range of packages and commands for various purposes, making it a powerful tool for professional document typesetting.
