\begin{abstract}
This code snippet is a complex example of using different packages in LATEX to create a document. It includes math equations, images, and algorithms.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
In this section, we will introduce the packages that are used in this code snippet.

\subsection{amsmath}
The \texttt{amsmath} package is used for writing and formatting mathematical equations. In this example, we will use the \texttt{equation} and \texttt{align} environments to write some equations.

\subsubsection{Equation}
The \texttt{equation} environment is used to write a single-line equation with a number for reference.
\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\label{eq:emc} % Label for referencing
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Align}
The \texttt{align} environment is used to write multiple equations, aligned at a specific symbol.
\begin{align}
3x + 2y &= 8 \\
2x + 6y &= 12
\end{align}

\subsection{graphicx}
The \texttt{graphicx} package is used for including images in the document.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{latexlogo.png}
\caption{LATEX Logo} % Caption for the image
\label{fig:latexlogo} % Label for referencing
\end{figure}

\subsection{algorithm and algorithmic}
The \texttt{algorithm} and \texttt{algorithmic} packages are used to write algorithms in pseudocode.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Euclid's algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers}\label{euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}[1] % Set line numbers
\Procedure{GCD}{a,b}
\If{$b = 0$}
\State \textbf{return} a
\Else
\State \textbf{return} $GCD(b, a \bmod b)$
\EndIf
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Conclusion}
In this code snippet, we have demonstrated the use of different packages in LATEX to create a document with math equations, images, and algorithms. This shows the versatility and power of LATEX as a typesetting tool.
