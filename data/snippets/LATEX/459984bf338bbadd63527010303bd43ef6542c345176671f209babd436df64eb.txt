    \section{Introduction}
    Here is a simple equation in \LaTeX:
    \begin{equation} %equation environment for displaying single-line mathematical equations
        E = mc^2
    \end{equation}
    Where:
    \begin{itemize} %itemize environment for creating bullet points
        \item $E$ stands for energy
        \item $m$ stands for mass
        \item $c$ stands for the speed of light
    \end{itemize}
    This equation is significant in the theory of relativity.
    \subsection{Proof}
    We can prove this equation using the Pythagorean theorem:
    \begin{equation}
        c^2 = a^2 + b^2
    \end{equation}
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $c$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle
        \item $a$ and $b$ are the other two sides
    \end{itemize}
    By substituting $c^2$ in the first equation with $a^2 + b^2$, we get:
    \begin{align*} %align environment for aligning equations at specific points
        E &= m(a^2 + b^2) \\
        E &= ma^2 + mb^2 \\
        E &= ma^2 + mb^2 \\
        E &= m(a^2 + b^2) \\
        E &= mc^2
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, we have proved the equation.
    
    \section{Images}
    We can also include images in \LaTeX.
    \begin{figure}[h] %figure environment for including images with a caption
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image} %include the image and set its width to half the width of the page
        \caption{An example image}
        \label{fig:example}
    \end{figure}
    
    As seen in Figure \ref{fig:example}, we can add a caption to the image and refer to it using a label.
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    \LaTeX can be used to create complex mathematical equations and include images in documents.
