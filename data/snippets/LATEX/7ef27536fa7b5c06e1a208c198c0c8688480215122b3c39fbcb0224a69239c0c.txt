    This code snippet is written in \LaTeX, a typesetting language used for creating professional documents. It showcases some basic features of \LaTeX, such as packages and document structure. It also includes comments, which are used for adding notes or explanations to the code. 
    \subsection{Basic Math} % Subsection heading
    The following equation is an example of how to use the \texttt{amsmath} package to write mathematical expressions: 
    \begin{equation*} 
        \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} 
    \end{equation*} 
    This equation shows that the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers is equal to $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. This is known as the Gauss's formula. 
    \subsection{Custom Commands} % Subsection heading
    \newcommand{\mycommand}{Some custom text} % Define a custom command 
    Now, let's use our custom command: \mycommand. This will output the text "Some custom text" wherever it is called. We can also include parameters in our custom command: 
    \newcommand{\greet}[1]{Hello, #1!} % Define a custom command with a parameter 
    \greet{Jane} % Output: Hello, Jane!

    \begin{itemize} 
        \item This is a bullet point.
        \item This is another bullet point.
    \end{itemize} 
    We can also include figures in our document: 
    \begin{figure} 
        \centering % Centers the figure 
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{sample_image.png} % Inserts a sample image 
        \caption{A sample image} % Caption for the figure 
        \label{fig:sample} % Label for referencing the figure in the text 
    \end{figure} 
    Figure \ref{fig:sample} shows a sample image.
