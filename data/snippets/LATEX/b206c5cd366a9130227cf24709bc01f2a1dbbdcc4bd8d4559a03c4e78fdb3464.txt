\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{a_i}{b_i} = c
\end{equation}

This is a complex code snippet written in LATEX. It uses the equation environment to generate a mathematical equation with summation and fractions. The syntax for the equation environment is "\begin{equation}" at the beginning of the code and "\end{equation}" at the end. Inside the environment, the equation itself is written using special characters and commands. In this snippet, we have used the sum symbol "\sum" to indicate summation and the subscript and superscript commands ("_{i=1}" and "^{n}") to specify the limits of the summation. The fraction is created using the "\frac{numerator}{denominator}" command. Finally, we have set the equation equal to the constant "c" using the equals sign "=".
