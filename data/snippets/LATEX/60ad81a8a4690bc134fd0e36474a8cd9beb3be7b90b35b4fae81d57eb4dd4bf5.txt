Welcome to my document!

\section{Introduction} %creates a section titled "Introduction"
In this document, we will be discussing the implementation of a sorting algorithm.

\subsection{Algorithm Overview} %creates a subsection titled "Algorithm Overview"
The algorithm we will be discussing is the bubble sort algorithm, which is known for its simplicity but also for its inefficiency.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, caption=Bubble Sort Algorithm] %creates a code listing with language set to Java and a caption
public void bubbleSort(int[] arr) { %defines the function with an integer array as parameter
  int n = arr.length; %sets the variable n to the length of the array

  for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) { %loops through the array
    for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) { %nested loop through the array
      if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) { %compares two consecutive elements in the array
        //swap arr[j+1] and arr[j]
        int temp = arr[j]; %temporary variable to store the value of arr[j]
        arr[j] = arr[j+1]; %swaps the values of arr[j] and arr[j+1]
        arr[j+1] = temp; %assigns the stored value to arr[j+1]
      }
    }
  }
}
