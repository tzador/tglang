\documentclass{article}
% This line tells LaTeX which type of document we are creating
% and loads the necessary packages for that type of document.

\usepackage{amsmath}
% This package adds additional math functionality to LaTeX.
% It is commonly used when writing scientific documents.

\title{LaTeX Code Snippet}
% The title of the document.

\author{John Doe}
% The author of the document.

\date{\today}
% This line automatically inserts the current date in the document.

\begin{document}
% This command starts the actual document.

\maketitle
% This command inserts the title, author, and date into the document.

\section{Introduction}
% This command creates a new section in the document.

LaTeX is a powerful typesetting language used for creating high-quality documents. It is widely used in the scientific and academic communities.
% This text will be included in the introduction section.

\section{Equations}
% This command creates another section in the document.

LaTeX makes it easy to create complex equations. We can use the \textit{amsmath} package to access advanced features.

The classic equation \textit{E=mc\textsuperscript{2}} can be written in LaTeX like this:
% This text will be included in the equations section.

\begin{equation}
% This command creates an equation environment.
E=mc^2
% This is the actual equation inside the environment.
\end{equation}
% This command ends the equation environment.

We can also use the \textit{align} environment to align multiple equations:
% This text will also be included in the equations section.

\begin{align}
% This command creates an align environment.
3x + y &= 5 \\
2x - 3y &= 2
% These are the equations inside the align environment, separated by the '&' symbol for alignment.
\end{align}
% This command ends the align environment.

\section{Tables}
% This command creates another section in the document.

Tables are another useful feature of LaTeX. We can create them using the \textit{tabular} environment.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|r|}
% This command creates a tabular environment with three columns, aligned left, center, and right respectively, and separated by vertical lines.
\hline % This command creates a horizontal line.
Name & Age & Occupation \\ % This is the header row.
\hline
John & 25 & Engineer \\ % This is the first row.
Jane & 23 & Student \\ % This is the second row.
\hline
% These commands create horizontal lines to separate the rows.
\end{tabular}
% This command ends the tabular environment.

\section{Conclusion}
% This command creates another section in the document.

In conclusion, LaTeX is a versatile language that allows for easy creation of complex documents with advanced features such as equations and tables.

\end{document}
% This command ends the document.
