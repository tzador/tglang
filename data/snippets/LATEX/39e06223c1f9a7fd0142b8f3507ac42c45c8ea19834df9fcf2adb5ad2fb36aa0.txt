\documentclass{article} %Defines the type of document as 'article'

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %Specifies encoding of document as 'utf-8'

\usepackage{amsmath} %Includes the amsmath package for advanced mathematical structures

\usepackage{graphicx} %Allows for importing images into document

\title{LATEX Code Snippet} %Specifies title of document

\author{John Doe} %Specifies author of document

\date{\today} %Specifies date of document, set to automatically display current date

\begin{document} %Begins the main document

\maketitle %Inserts title, author, and date information into document

This is a long and complex code snippet written in LATEX. %Adds a text snippet to the document

\section{Introduction} %Creates a new section with title 'Introduction'

In this code snippet, we will showcase some of the advanced features of the LATEX markup language. %Adds text to the section

\subsection{Linguistic Features} %Creates a sub-section with title 'Linguistic Features'

LATEX provides various linguistic features that can be used to improve the readability and accuracy of documents. For example, we can use the \textit{emphasis} command to emphasize certain words in a sentence.

\subsection{Mathematical Equations} %Creates another sub-section with title 'Mathematical Equations'

The amsmath package allows for the inclusion and formatting of complex mathematical equations. For example, we can write the famous Pythagorean Theorem as: 

\begin{equation} %Begins a numbered mathematical equation
    c^2 = a^2 + b^2 %Specifies the equation
\end{equation} %Ends the equation

\subsection{Figures and Tables} %Creates another sub-section with title 'Figures and Tables'

The graphicx package lets us insert and manipulate images, while the tabular environment allows for the creation of tables. We can combine these two features to create a table with an image in the background:

\begin{figure}[h] %Begins a figure environment with 'here' positioning option
    \centering %Centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.png} %Inserts an image with specified width
    \caption{Sample Table} %Adds a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:table} %Adds a label for referencing
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|} %Begins a table with two columns separated by vertical lines
        \hline %Adds a horizontal line
        A & B \\ %Adds a row with column entries 'A' and 'B'
        \hline %Adds another horizontal line
        C & D \\ %Adds another row with column entries 'C' and 'D'
        \hline %Adds another horizontal line
    \end{tabular} %Ends the table
\end{figure} %Ends the figure

\section{Conclusion} %Creates a new section titled 'Conclusion'

Overall, we can use LATEX to create beautiful and sophisticated documents with advanced features and functionalities. It is a powerful markup language that is widely used in the academic and scientific community. %Adds text to the section

\end{document} %Ends the main document
