%This is a comment in LaTeX.

\documentclass{article} %This is a document class declaration.

\usepackage{amsmath} %This is a package import.

\begin{document} %This is the starting point of the document.
    
    \title{Latex Code Snippet} %This is the title of the document.
    \author{John Smith} %This is the author of the document.
    \date{\today} %This is the date of the document, it will be the current date when compiled.
    
    \maketitle %This command will create the title in the document.
    
    \section{Introduction} %This is the first section of the document.
    This is a sample document created using LaTeX. 
    %From here onwards, we will include various types of formatting and commands.
    
    \subsection{Text Formatting} %This is a sub-section under the Introduction section.
    Here, we will showcase how to format text in LaTeX.
    \textbf{This text will be bold.} \\ %This command makes the text bold.
    \textit{This text will be italic.} \\ %This command makes the text italic.
    \underline{This text will be underlined.} \\ %This command makes the text underlined.
    \emph{This text will be emphasized.} \\ %This command makes the text emphasized.
    
    \subsection{Mathematical Equations} %This is another sub-section under the Introduction.
    LaTeX is widely used for typesetting mathematical equations.
    Below we will show examples of different types of equations.
    
    \subsubsection{Inline Equations} %This is a sub-sub-section under the Mathematical Equations section.
    An inline equation, such as $a + b = c$, can be created using the dollar symbol and the appropriate math symbols.
    
    \subsubsection{Numbered Equations} %This is another sub-sub-section under the Mathematical Equations section.
    Numbered equations can be created using the equation environment.
    \begin{equation}
        F = m \cdot a %This is the equation we want to number and reference.
    \end{equation}
    
    \subsubsection{Aligned Equations} %Another sub-sub-section under the Mathematical Equations section.
    Aligned equations can be created using the align environment.
    \begin{align}
        a + b &= c \\
        b &= c - a
    \end{align}
    
    \subsection{Lists} %This is another sub-section under the Introduction section.
    We can create both numbered and bullet-point lists in LaTeX.
    
    \subsubsection{Numbered List} %A sub-sub-section under the Lists section.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item First item
        \item Second item
        \item Third item
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsubsection{Bullet-point List} %Another sub-sub-section under the Lists section.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First item
        \item Second item
        \item Third item
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Tables} %This is another sub-section under the Introduction section.
    Tables can also be easily created in LaTeX.
    \begin{center} %This command centers the following content.
        \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } %This command creates a table with 3 columns, each centered.
            \hline %This command creates a horizontal line.
            Cell 1 & Cell 2 & Cell 3 \\ %These are the contents of the first row.
            \hline
            Cell 4 & Cell 5 & Cell 6 \\ %These are the contents of the second row.
            \hline
            Cell 7 & Cell 8 & Cell 9 \\ %These are the contents of the third row.
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    
    \subsection{References} %This is another sub-section under the Introduction section.
    We can add references and citations in our document using the cite command.
    This sentence is referencing a source \cite{example}.
    
    \begin{thebibliography}{9} %This creates a numbered list of references with a max of 9 items.
        \bibitem{example} %The name in the curly braces is the name we will reference in the document.
        John Smith. %The actual reference.
        \textit{LaTeX for Beginners}. %The title of the reference.
        2020. %The date of the reference.
    \end{thebibliography}
    
\end{document} %This is the end of the document.
