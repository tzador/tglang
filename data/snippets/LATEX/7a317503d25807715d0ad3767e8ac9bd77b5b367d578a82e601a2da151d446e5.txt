\section{Introduction}
% This creates a new section titled 'Introduction'

In this code snippet, we will explore some of the advanced features of LATEX.

\section{Mathematical Equations}
% This creates a new section titled 'Mathematical Equations'

LATEX has a variety of tools for typesetting mathematical equations, including fractions, exponents, and integrals. We can use the \textit{equation} environment to display equations in their own line:

\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=0}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
    % This equation calculates the sum of numbers from 0 to n
\end{equation}

We can also use the \textit{align} environment to align multiple equations or inequalities:

\begin{align*}
    \alpha + \beta &= \gamma \\
    2x + 3y &\leq 10
\end{align*}

\section{Custom Commands}
% This creates a new section titled 'Custom Commands'

One of the greatest strengths of LATEX is its ability to create custom commands and macros to simplify repetitive tasks. For example, we can define a command called \textit{twodigits} to format numbers with leading zeros:

\newcommand{\twodigits}[1]{\ifnum #1<10 0#1\else #1\fi}
% This command checks if the number is less than 10, and if so, adds a leading zero

Now, we can easily display the current time in a consistent format:

The time is \twodigits{\thehour}:\twodigits{\theminute}.
% This command uses the built-in \thehour and \theminute macros to get the current time and formats them using our custom command

\section{Graphics and Figures}
% This creates a new section titled 'Graphics and Figures'

LATEX allows for the inclusion of graphics and figures within a document. We can use the \textit{graphicx} package to import images and the \textit{subcaption} package to display multiple subfigures:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{image1.jpg}
        \caption{Image 1}
    \end{subfigure}
    ~
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{image2.jpg}
        \caption{Image 2}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Two images side by side}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}
% This creates a new section titled 'Conclusion'

We have only scratched the surface of the capabilities of LATEX in this code snippet. With its vast array of packages and customization options, it is a powerful tool for creating professional-looking documents with complex equations and graphics.
