$\documentclass{article} % Defines the type of document

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % Specifies the encoding for the document, UTF-8 is commonly used

\usepackage{amsmath} % Provides a set of useful mathematical functionalities

\begin{document} % Begins the document

\title{Complex Latex Code Snippet} % Sets the title of the document
\author{John Doe} % Sets the author of the document
\date{\today} % Sets the date of the document to today's date

\maketitle % Generates the title, author, and date

\tableofcontents % Generates a table of contents based on the section and subsections

\section{Introduction} % Begins a new section with the title "Introduction"
This is a complex latex code snippet, it contains multiple features and functionalities.

\subsection{Mathematical Equations} % Begins a new subsection with the title "Mathematical Equations"
Latex is great for typesetting mathematical equations, such as the famous Pythagorean theorem:

\begin{equation} % Begins a new equation environment
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 % Sets the equation
\end{equation} % Ends the equation environment

and the quadratic formula:

\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Lists} % Begins a new subsection with the title "Lists"
Latex also has different types of lists, such as bullet points:

\begin{itemize} % Begins a new itemize environment (bullet point list)
\item Item 1 % Sets an item
\item Item 2
\item Item 3
\end{itemize} % Ends the itemize environment

and numbered lists:

\begin{enumerate} % Begins a new enumerate environment (numbered list)
\item First item % Sets an item
\item Second item
\item Third item
\end{enumerate} % Ends the enumerate environment

\subsection{Images} % Begins a new subsection with the title "Images"
Latex allows you to include images in your document, like this cute cat:

\begin{figure}[h] % Begins a new figure environment with the image placement set to "here"
\centering % Centers the image
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{cat.jpg} % Includes the image, with a scale of 0.5 (half the original size)
\caption{A cute cat} % Sets the caption for the image
\end{figure} % Ends the figure environment

\subsection{Tables} % Begins a new subsection with the title "Tables"
Tables are also possible in latex, such as this simple multiplication table:

\begin{table}[h] % Begins a new table environment with the placement set to "here"
\centering % Centers the table
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c} % Begins the table with three columns, separated by vertical lines
 & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} \\ % Sets the headers for the first and second column, with the text in bold
\hline % Inserts a horizontal line
\textbf{1} & 1 & 2 \\ % Sets the first row of the table
\hline % Inserts a horizontal line
\textbf{2} & 2 & 4 \\ % Sets the second row of the table
\end{tabular} % Ends the table
\caption{Multiplication table} % Sets the caption for the table
\end{table} % Ends the table environment

\section{Conclusion} % Begins a new section with the title "Conclusion"
Latex is a powerful tool for creating professional-looking documents with complex features. It may have a steep learning curve, but the results are worth it. Happy coding!
