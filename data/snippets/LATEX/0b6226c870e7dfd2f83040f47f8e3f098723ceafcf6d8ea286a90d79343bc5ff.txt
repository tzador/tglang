% This is a long and complex code snippet in LaTeX
% It contains a description of a function and uses various math symbols and formatting

\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
\end{equation*}

% This is the Taylor series expansion of a function f(x) around the point a.
% It uses the summation symbol, superscripts, and subscript notation to represent the expansion.

% Begin defining the function
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = e^x
\end{equation*}

% This function is e^x, which is often used in mathematical and scientific calculations.

% Begin expanding the function around the point a = 0
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{(n)}(0)}{n!}(x-0)^n
\end{equation*}

% Note that the function has been written in its derivative form, with the (n) representing the nth derivative of e^x.

% Simplify the equation using the fact that e^0 = 1 and 1/n! can be written as 1/(n-1)!
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(n-1)!}(x)^n
\end{equation*}

% Use the definition of factorials to further simplify the equation
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + ...
\end{equation*}

% This is the final form of the Taylor series expansion of e^x around a = 0.

% End the function definition and add a closing equation
\end{equation*}

% This code snippet may seem long and complex, but it is a representation of a very useful and fundamental mathematical concept.
