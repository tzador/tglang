This is my document about how to write complex code snippets in \LaTeX. First, let's take a look at how to import packages.

\section{Importing Packages}
To import a package, use the command \verb|\usepackage[name]{package}|. For example, to import the \verb|geometry| package, we would write:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\usepackage{geometry}
\end{lstlisting}
Packages allow you to add extra functionality to your document. For example, the \verb|geometry| package allows you to set the margins of your document.

\section{Defining Commands}
In \LaTeX, you can define your own commands using the \verb|\newcommand| command. For example, if we want to create a command for bold text, we can write:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\newcommand{\mybold}[1]{\textbf{#1}}
\end{lstlisting}
This command takes in one argument and returns the argument wrapped in bold text. We can then use this command in our document as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
This is \mybold{bold text}.
\end{lstlisting}
which would output: "This is \textbf{bold text}." 

\section{Creating Figures}
To add a figure to our document, we first need to import the \verb|graphicx| package. Then, we can use the \verb|\includegraphics| command to insert our image. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.png}
    \caption{My Image}
    \label{fig:image}
\end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}
In the above code, we have created a figure environment and centered our image. We have also specified the width of the image to be 50% of the text width. We have also added a caption and label to our figure, which we can reference later using the \verb|\ref| command.

\section{Creating Equations}
The \verb|amsmath| package provides various environments for writing equations. Here's an example of how to write a simple equation:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\begin{equation}
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}
\end{lstlisting}
which would output: 
\begin{equation}
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}
You can also use the \verb|align| environment to align multiple equations:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\begin{align}
    a &= b + c \\
    d &= e + f
\end{align}
\end{lstlisting}
which would output:
\begin{align}
    a &= b + c \\
    d &= e + f
\end{align}

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, \LaTeX  is a powerful tool for writing complex code snippets and creating professional-looking documents. With the use of packages, commands, and environments, you can easily customize your document to fit your needs. Happy coding!
