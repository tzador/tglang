% Creates a new section titled "Introduction"
This is a complex \LaTeX{} code snippet that showcases the use of various packages and commands. 
We will cover different mathematical expressions, including fractions, integrals, and matrices, as well as formatting options, such as font size and aligning equations.
% Some text for demonstration purposes

\subsection{Mathematical Expressions}
% Creates a subsection titled "Mathematical Expressions"
We can write mathematical expressions using the \texttt{equation} environment:
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-t}dt
    % This is a mathematical expression with a fraction and an integral 
\end{equation}
The above equation shows the use of the \texttt{frac} command for fractions and the \texttt{int} command for integrals.
We can also use the \texttt{align} environment for multiple equations with aligned equal signs:
\begin{align}
    g(x) &= x^2 + x - 1 \\
    h(x) &= \bm{x\cdot x} + \frac{1}{x} + \sqrt{x}
    % Two equations with aligned equal signs and the use of the bold symbol with \bm
\end{align}
Furthermore, we can use the \texttt{matrix} environment to create matrices:
\begin{equation}
    A = \begin{matrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        4 & 5 & 6 \\
        7 & 8 & 9 
    \end{matrix}
    % A simple 3x3 matrix created using the matrix environment
\end{equation}

\subsection{Formatting Options}
% Creates another subsection titled "Formatting Options"
We can change the font size using commands such as \texttt{tiny}, \texttt{small}, \texttt{large}, etc:
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \tiny{\frac{1}{x^2}} \small{\int_{0}^{\infty}} \large{e^{-t}}dt
    % Changes the font size of the different elements in the expression
\end{equation}
We can also align equations using the \texttt{aligned} environment:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        F(x) &= \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} a_nx^n \\
        &= a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots
    \end{aligned}
    % A two-line equation aligned at the equal sign using the aligned environment 
\end{equation}

\section{Conclusion}
% Creates a new section titled "Conclusion"
In this code snippet, we have seen how to use various packages, commands, and formatting options to create complex and professional-looking mathematical expressions in \LaTeX{}. With practice and further exploration, you can create even more complex and beautiful documents using \LaTeX{}.
