%Main body of the document
\section{Introduction}
This is a long and complex code snippet written in LATEX to demonstrate its use in generating documents.

\section{Equations}
%Example of an equation
The Schr√∂dinger equation is given by:
\begin{equation}
    i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{x},t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{x},t)
\end{equation}
where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, $\Psi(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the wave function, and $\mathbf{x}$ is the position vector.

\section{Graphics}
%Example of inserting a graphic
Here is an example of inserting an image in LATEX:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{my_image.png}
    \caption{Example of an image}
    \label{fig:image}
\end{figure}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:image}, the graphic can be easily inserted and formatted within the document.

\section{References}
%Example of referencing and formatting URLs
LATEX also makes it easy to format and reference URLs, like this one for LATEX's official website: \url{https://www.latex-project.org/}

\section{Conclusion}
That concludes this demonstration of a long and complex code snippet in LATEX. It showcases some of the useful features and capabilities of this powerful document preparation tool.
