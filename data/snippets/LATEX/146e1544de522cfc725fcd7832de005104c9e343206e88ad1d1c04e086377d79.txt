\node[draw, rectangle, fill=blue, text width=3cm, align=center, anchor=north] (box1) at (0,0) {This is a long and complex text that spans over multiple lines and is formatted in LaTeX.};

Here, we are creating a node with the "rectangle" shape and giving it a blue fill color. The text inside the node is set to be 3cm wide and centered. The node is being placed at the coordinates (0,0) and is given the name "box1" for later use.

Note: All options are separated by commas, and must be enclosed in square brackets. The format for each option is "option name=option value".
