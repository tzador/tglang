\section{Introduction} %creating a section
In this code snippet, we will be exploring how to create a complex LATEX document with different sections, formatting, and packages. %writing a section introduction
\section{Equations} %creating a section for equations
LATEX is known for its ability to handle complex mathematical equations.%writing a section introduction
Let's take a look at the famous Euler's identity: %writing a sentence
\begin{equation} %beginning the equation
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 %writing the equation
\end{equation} %ending the equation
We can also use the \textit{amsmath} package to align multiple equations:
\begin{align*} %beginning the align environment
x + y &= z \\ %writing the first equation
2x + y &= 3 \\ %writing the second equation
3x + y &= 5 %writing the third equation
\end{align*} %ending the align environment
\section{Figures} %creating a section for figures
We can also insert figures in our document using the \textit{graphicx} package.%writing a section introduction
\begin{figure}[h] %beginning the figure environment with [h] as placement specifier
    \centering %aligning the figure to the center
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.png} %inserting the image and setting its width to half of the text width
    \caption{Example Figure} %creating a caption for the figure
    \label{fig:example} %labeling the figure for referencing
\end{figure} %ending the figure environment
As you can see in Figure \ref{fig:example}, we can also add a caption and label to our figures for easier referencing within the document.
\section{Links} %creating a section for links
The \textit{url} package allows us to add clickable hyperlinks in our document.%writing a section introduction
Check out this link to learn more about LATEX: \url{https://www.latex-project.org/} %hyperlinking the URL and adding text for the link
