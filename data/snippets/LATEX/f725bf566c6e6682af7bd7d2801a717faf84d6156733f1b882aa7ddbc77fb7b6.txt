\section{Introduction} %creates a new section titled "Introduction"

This code snippet showcases the use of various packages and commands in Latex to create a professional and complex document. It includes the use of mathematical symbols, hyperlinks, and image insertion.

\subsection{Equations} %creates a subsection titled "Equations"

In this section, we will demonstrate the use of the \textbf{amsmath} package to create complex equations.

The equation for calculating the area of a circle is given by:

\begin{equation} %begins the equation environment
    A = \pi r^2 %actual equation, written in LaTeX syntax
\end{equation} %end of equation environment

Where $A$ is the area, $r$ is the radius, and $\pi$ is the mathematical constant.

We can also write multiple equations aligned at a specific point using the \textbf{align} environment:

\begin{align}
    x &= y+z \\ %use "&" to indicate where the equations should be aligned
    f(x) &= a \cdot (x-h)^2 + k \\
    g(x) &= \sqrt{1-x^2}
\end{align}

\subsection{Proofs} %creates a subsection titled "Proofs"

The \textbf{amsthm} package allows the insertion of proofs in the document. Here, we will prove Pythagoras' Theorem:

\begin{theorem} %begins the theorem environment
    In a right angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
\end{theorem} %end of theorem environment

\begin{proof} %begins the proof environment
    Let the sides of the right angled triangle be $a$, $b$, and $c$, with $c$ being the hypotenuse. From the Pythagoras theorem, we have:
    
    \begin{equation} %begins the equation environment
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    \end{equation} %end of equation environment
    
    Multiplying both sides by $a$, we get:
    
    \begin{equation}
        ac^2 = a^3 + ab^2
    \end{equation}
    
    Similarly, multiplying both sides by $b$, we get:
    
    \begin{equation}
        bc^2 = b^3 + a^2b
    \end{equation}
    
    Adding the two equations, we get:
    
    \begin{equation}
        ac^2 + bc^2 = a^3 + b^3 + a^2b + ab^2
    \end{equation}
    
    Simplifying and factoring, we get:
    
    \begin{equation}
        c^2(a+b) = (a+b)(a^2+b^2)
    \end{equation}
    
    Dividing both sides by $(a+b)$, we get:
    
    \begin{equation}
        c^2 = a^2 + b^2
    \end{equation}
    
    Thus, we have proved Pythagoras' Theorem.
\end{proof}

\section{Images} %creates a new section titled "Images"

We can insert images into the document using the \textbf{graphicx} package. Here, we will insert an image of the Mandelbrot set:

\begin{figure} %begins the figure environment
    \centering %centers the image on the page
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{mandelbrot.jpg} %inserts the image, with a width of half the text width
    \caption{The Mandelbrot set} %creates a caption for the image
    \label{fig:mandelbrot} %creates a label for referencing the image later in the document
\end{figure} %end of figure environment

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:mandelbrot}, the Mandelbrot set is a beautiful and complex mathematical object.

\section{Hyperlinks} %creates a new section titled "Hyperlinks"

We can create hyperlinks within the document using the \textbf{hyperref} package. Here, we will create a link to the Wikipedia page for the Riemann Hypothesis \cite{riemann}.

\subsection{Riemann Hypothesis} %creates a subsection titled "Riemann Hypothesis"

The Riemann Hypothesis states that all nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have a real part of $\frac{1}{2}$. Click \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis}{here} to learn more.

\bibliographystyle{plain} %specifies the style for the bibliography
\bibliography{references} %includes the references from the "references.bib" file
