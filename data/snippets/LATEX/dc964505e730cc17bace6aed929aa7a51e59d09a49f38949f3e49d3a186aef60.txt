%Introduction
\section{Introduction}
Welcome to my complex code snippet in LATEX! In this snippet, we will explore various mathematical equations and use packages to enhance the readability of our document.

%Equation
\section{Equation}
The equation below is an example of the quadratic formula:

%Quadratic Formula
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}

%Image
\section{Image}
Let's now include an image in our document. This can be achieved using the \verb|includegraphics| command.

%Including an Image
\begin{figure}[h] %Sets the figure to be placed here in the document (h = here)
    \centering %Centers the image
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image.jpg} %Includes the image named 'image.jpg' at a scale of 0.5
    \caption{A beautiful landscape.} %Caption for the image
    \label{fig:landscape} %Label for referencing the image later
\end{figure}

%Theorem
\section{Theorem}
Now, let's showcase a theorem using the \verb|newtheorem| command.

%Creating a Theorem
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem} %Creates a theorem environment with the name 'theorem'
\begin{theorem}
    Let $n$ be an integer. If $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is also even.
\end{theorem}

%Proof
\begin{proof}
    We can write $n$ as $2k$, for some integer $k$. Therefore, $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$. Since $2k^2$ is also an integer, $n^2$ is even.
\end{proof}

%Conclusion
\section{Conclusion}
We have now reached the end of our complex code snippet in LATEX. Thank you for reading and I hope this has helped you in understanding how to incorporate equations, images, and theorems in your LATEX documents.
