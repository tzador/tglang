\begin{document} % Begin document

\maketitle % Creates a title page with the defined title, author, and date

\section{Introduction} % Creates a section titled "Introduction" 

This is my first \LaTeX{} document and I am learning how to use it. % Inserts text with the use of \LaTeX{} to display the LaTeX symbol

\section{Equations} % Creates a section titled "Equations"

\subsection{Pythagorean Theorem} % Creates a subsection titled "Pythagorean Theorem"

The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. It can be represented by the equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. % Inserts text and an equation using math notation

\subsection{Euler's Identity} % Creates a subsection titled "Euler's Identity"

Euler's identity is considered one of the most beautiful and profound equations in mathematics, as it combines five fundamental mathematical constants: $e$, the base of natural logarithms; $i$, the imaginary unit; $\pi$, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter; $1$, the multiplicative identity; and $0$, the additive identity. It can be represented by the equation $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$. % Inserts text and an equation using math notation

\section{Images} % Creates a section titled "Images"

\begin{figure}[h] % Begins a figure environment with the placement specifier "h" for "here"
  \centering % Centers the following content
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{universe.jpg} % Inserts an image named "universe.jpg" with a width of 50% of the text width
  \caption{The Universe} % Inserts a caption for the image
  \label{fig:universe} % Labels the image as "universe" for future reference
\end{figure} % Ends the figure environment

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:universe}, the universe is a vast and mysterious place. % Inserts text and references the previously labeled image
