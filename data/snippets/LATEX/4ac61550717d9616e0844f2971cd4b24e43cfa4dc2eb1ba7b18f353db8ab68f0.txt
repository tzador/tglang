\section{Introduction} % Creates a new section with the title "Introduction"
Welcome to my example document!
This document serves as a demonstration of LATEX features and functionality.

\section{Basic Formatting} % Creates a new section with the title "Basic Formatting"
LATEX makes it easy to format text in various styles.
For example, you can \emph{emphasize} or \textbf{bold} certain words.
You can also create {\large large} or {\small small} text.
You can even \textcolor{red}{change the color} of your text!

\section{Mathematical Equations} % Creates a new section with the title "Mathematical Equations"
LATEX has robust capabilities for typesetting mathematical equations.
Here is an example of the quadratic formula:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

\section{Including Images} % Creates a new section with the title "Including Images"
LATEX allows you to easily import and display images.
Here is an example using the \texttt{graphicx} package:

\begin{figure}[h] % "h" indicates that the figure should be placed here in the document
    \centering % Centers the image
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example_image.png} % Specifies the image file and sets the width to half of the text width
    \caption{An example image} % Adds a caption to the image
    \label{fig:example} % Adds a label for referencing the image in the document
\end{figure}

As you can see in Figure \ref{fig:example}, LATEX automatically numbers the figures and allows you to refer to them in your document.

\section{Hyperlinks and Cross-referencing} % Creates a new section with the title "Hyperlinks and Cross-referencing"
LATEX also has the ability to create hyperlinks and cross-reference different parts of the document.
Here is an example using the \texttt{hyperref} package:

To learn more about LATEX, check out the official \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{LATEX website}.
You can also refer to Section \ref{sec:math} for examples of mathematical equations.

\section{Including Code Snippets} % Creates a new section with the title "Including Code Snippets"
LATEX also has a package for including code snippets in various programming languages.
Here is an example of a C++ code snippet using the \texttt{listings} package:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption=An example C++ code snippet]
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

You can see that LATEX properly formats the code snippet and even adds a caption for referencing it.
