\section{Introduction}

%% Prints text and uses custom commands
LaTeX is a popular typesetting system used for creating professional and high-quality documents. It allows for easy formatting, mathematical expressions, and cross-referencing. Here, we define the sets of natural numbers ($\N$) and integers ($\Z$) as new commands for convenience.

\section{Document Settings}

%% Prints text and sets up a bulleted list
This document uses the \texttt{amsfonts} package to display mathematical symbols and equations accurately. The following options have been set for the document layout:

%% Starts itemize environment
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{parindent} sets the indentation of paragraphs to 0 points.
    \item \texttt{parskip} adjusts the spacing between paragraphs to 10 points.
    \item \texttt{textheight} sets the height of the text to 9.5 inches.
    \item \texttt{topmargin} adjusts the top margin to account for headers.
    \item \texttt{textwidth} sets the width of the text to 7 inches.
    \item \texttt{oddsidemargin} and \texttt{evensidemargin} adjust the margins for odd and even pages, respectively.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
