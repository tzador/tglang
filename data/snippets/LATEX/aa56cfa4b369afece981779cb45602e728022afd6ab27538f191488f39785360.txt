\begin{equation*}
% this line begins a math equation without an equation number
    \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} = \frac{\pi}{4}
    % this line creates the equation, using a summation, fraction, and an alternate notation for pi
\end{equation*}
Let's break this equation down and annotate it to better understand each component.

The summation symbol $\sum$ indicates that we are taking the sum of multiple terms.
% explain the summation symbol and its purpose
The subscript $n=0$ specifies the starting index for the summation.
% explain the subscript and its purpose
The superscript $\infty$ represents the upper limit of the summation, in this case, an infinite number of terms.
% explain the superscript and its purpose
The term inside the summation, $\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}$, is the actual expression we are summing.
% explain the term and its purpose
This fraction alternates between positive and negative values, with the $(-1)^n$ term changing the sign every other term.
% explain the alternating sign and its purpose
The denominator, $2n+1$, increases by 2 with each term, starting at 1 and increasing by 2, 3, 5, and so on.
% explain the denominator and its purpose
The result of this summation equals $\frac{\pi}{4}$, which is approximately $0.7853981634$ in decimal form.
