\section{Introduction} % start of introduction section

This is a complex code snippet in LATEX that includes various packages and commands to create a well-formatted document. % introduction text

\section{Math} % start of math section

Here is an equation using mathematical symbols:

\begin{equation} % start of equation
    \label{eq:example} % equation label, can be referenced later
    \nabla^2 \phi = \frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial y^2} % equation content
\end{equation} % end of equation

This equation shows the Laplace operator applied to the function $\phi$.

\section{Figures} % start of figure section

Here is an example of including a figure in the document:

\begin{figure} % start of figure environment
    \centering % center the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figure.png} % specify figure width and file name
    \caption{Example Figure} % figure caption
    \label{fig:example} % figure label, can be referenced later
\end{figure} % end of figure environment

Figure \ref{fig:example} shows an example figure included in the document.

\section{Conclusion} % start of conclusion section

In conclusion, this complex code snippet showcases the various capabilities of LATEX when used to create a document. It includes packages for handling unicode characters, font encoding, mathematical equations and symbols, and graphics.
