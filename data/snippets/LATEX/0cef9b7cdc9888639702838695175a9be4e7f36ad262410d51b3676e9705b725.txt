Here is a long and complex equation:

\begin{equation*}
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation*}

This equation uses the quadratic formula to solve for the roots of a quadratic equation.

\begin{itemize} % starting list environment
    \item $a$, $b$, and $c$ are variables representing the coefficients of the quadratic equation.
    \item $x$ represents the unknown variable we are solving for.
    \item The $\pm$ symbol indicates that there are two possible solutions.
    \item The $\sqrt{}$ symbol calculates the square root of the expression inside.
    \item The $2a$ in the denominator is a common factor in the formula.
\end{itemize} % ending list environment

This equation can also be written as:

\begin{equation*}
    x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation*}

This code snippet showcases how LaTeX can be used to typeset complex mathematical equations in a visually appealing and organized manner.
