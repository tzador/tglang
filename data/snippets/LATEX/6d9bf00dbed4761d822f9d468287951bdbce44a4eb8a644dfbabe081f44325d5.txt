%This is a LATEX code snippet for creating a matrix with annotations
\begin{bmatrix} %start of matrix
1 & 2 & 3 \\ %row 1 with 3 elements separated by '&'
4 & 5 & 6 \\ %row 2 with 3 elements separated by '&'
7 & 8 & 9 %row 3 with 3 elements, no need for '\\' at the end of last row
\end{bmatrix} %end of matrix
\begin{tikzpicture}[overlay,remember picture] %start of tikzpicture to add annotations on top
%This code adds annotations on the matrix, using coordinates to position them
\node [above=2mm, right=8mm] at (current page.south west){ %position the first annotation 2mm above the bottom left corner of the current page
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b & c \\ %row 1 of annotation, with 3 elements separated by '&'
d & e & f \\ %row 2 of annotation, with 3 elements separated by '&'
g & h & i %row 3 of annotation, no need for '\\' at the end of last row
\end{bmatrix} %end of annotation matrix
}; %end of the first annotation
\node [above=2mm, right=12mm] at (current page.south west){ %position the second annotation 2mm above the bottom left corner of the current page
\begin{bmatrix}
j & k & l \\ %row 1 of annotation, with 3 elements separated by '&'
m & n & o \\ %row 2 of annotation, with 3 elements separated by '&'
p & q & r %row 3 of annotation, no need for '\\' at the end of last row
\end{bmatrix} %end of annotation matrix
}; %end of the second annotation
