% This line defines a new command called 'vect' for vector notation
\newcommand{\vect}[1]{\boldsymbol{#1}}

In this document, we will explore some complex math equations and their applications.

First, let us define some vectors using the newly created 'vect' command:

% These lines define three different vectors using the 'vect' command
$\vect{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$  % the vector v with values 1, 2, and 3
$\vect{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 4 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$  % the vector w with values -2, 4, and 6
$\vect{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$  % the vector x with values 3, 5, and -1

Now, let us perform some vector operations:

% These lines demonstrate the dot product and cross product operations on the vectors defined above
$\vect{v} \cdot \vect{w} = 1 \times (-2) + 2 \times 4 + 3 \times 6 = 16$  % the dot product of vectors v and w
$\vect{v} \times \vect{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -10 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$  % the cross product of vectors v and x

Next, let us look at some matrix operations:

% These lines define two 2x2 matrices and perform matrix multiplication on them
$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$  % the matrix A with values 1, 2, 3, and 4
$B = \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{pmatrix}$  % the matrix B with values 5, 6, 7, and 8
$A \times B = \begin{pmatrix} 19 & 22 \\ 43 & 50 \end{pmatrix}$  % the matrix product of A and B

Finally, let us use the 'amsmath' package to solve a system of linear equations:

% These lines define a system of linear equations and use the 'align' environment from the 'amsmath' package to solve it
\begin{align*}  % the 'align' environment allows for multiple equations to be aligned and solved together
    2x + 3y &= 10 \\  % the first equation
    4x - 5y &= 2  % the second equation
\end{align*}

This system of equations can be solved by using the following steps:

% These lines use annotations to break down the steps of solving the system of equations
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 2:
        \begin{align*}
            8x + 12y &= 40 \\  % the first equation multiplied by 4
            8x - 10y &= 4  % the second equation multiplied by 2
        \end{align*}
    \item Subtract the second equation from the first, eliminating the variable 'x':
        \begin{align*}
            22y &= 36  % the result after subtracting the two equations
        \end{align*}
    \item Solve for 'y': $y = \frac{36}{22}$ or $y \approx 1.636$
    \item Substitute the value of 'y' into either of the original equations to solve for 'x':
        \begin{align*}
            2x + 3(1.636) &= 10 \\
            2x &= 10 - 4.908 \\
            x &= \frac{5.092}{2} \\
            x &\approx 2.546
        \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $x \approx 2.546$ and $y \approx 1.636$.
