% Defining a custom environment for mathematical proofs
\newenvironment{Proof} % Name of the environment
    {\begin{proof}\mbox{}} % Code to be executed at the beginning of the environment
		{\end{proof}} % Code to be executed at the end of the environment

% Custom command for introducing a hypothesis in a proof
\newcommand{\hypothesis}[1]{\textbf{Hypothesis}: #1\\}

% Custom command for writing the conclusion of a proof
\newcommand{\conclusion}[1]{\textbf{Conclusion}: #1}

% Example usage of the custom environment and commands
\begin{Proof} % Starting the environment
    \hypothesis{$A$ is an invertible matrix} % Hypothesis
    \textbf{Proof}: % Label for the proof
    By definition of invertible matrix, $AA^{-1} = I$. \\ % Explanation
    We can rewrite this as $A^{-1}A = I$. % Explanation
    \conclusion{$A^{-1}$ is also invertible} % Conclusion
\end{Proof} % Ending the environment
