\begin{proof} % Beginning of proof environment
    Let $r$ be the rank of $A$ and let $\sigma_1,\sigma_2,...,\sigma_r$ be the nonzero singular values of $A$. % Variables used in the proof
    Since the rank of $A$ is defined as the maximum number of linearly independent columns or rows, the linear combination of columns or rows of $A$ with coefficients from the field will result in the zero vector. % Explanation of rank definition
    This can be written as the matrix equation $Ax=0$, where $x$ is a vector of coefficients.
    Since $\sigma_1,\sigma_2,...,\sigma_r$ are all nonzero, the columns of $A$ corresponding to these singular values are linearly independent. 
    They form a basis for the range of $A$, represented by the matrix $U$.
    Similarly, the columns of $U$ corresponding to the remaining singular values form a basis for the null space of $A$, represented by the matrix $V$.
    Therefore, we can write $A = U \Sigma V^T$, where $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix with $\sigma_1,\sigma_2,...,\sigma_r$ on the diagonal and zeros everywhere else.
    Now, we can rewrite the matrix equation $Ax=0$ as $U\Sigma V^Tx = 0$, which can also be written as $\Sigma V^Tx = 0$ since $U$ is invertible.
    This shows that $V^Tx = 0$ since $\Sigma$ only contains nonzero singular values.
    Since $V$ contains linearly independent columns, this implies that $x = 0$, and thus the only solution to $Ax=0$ is $x=0$.
    This proves that the null space of $A$ only contains the zero vector, and thus the rank of $A$ is equal to the number of nonzero singular values. % Explanation of proof steps
