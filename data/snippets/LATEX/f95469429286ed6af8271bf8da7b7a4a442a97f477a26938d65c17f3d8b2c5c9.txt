\section{Equations}
LATEX is known for its ability to handle mathematical equations and formulas with precision and elegance. You can easily write equations in LATEX using the built-in math mode.

Here is an example of a simple equation:
\begin{equation}
    E = mc^2
\end{equation}

In this equation, $E$ represents energy, $m$ represents mass, and $c$ represents the speed of light.

You can also use the \te{align} environment for multiple equations:
\begin{align}
    \mb{F} &= m\mb{a} \\
    \mb{a} &= \frac{\mb{F}}{m}
\end{align}

\section{Figures}
LATEX also allows for easy insertion of figures and images into documents. Here is an example:
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering % Centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{latex_logo.png} % Inserts the image and sets its width to half of the text width
    \caption{LATEX Logo} % Caption for the figure
    \label{fig:latexlogo} % Label for referencing the figure in the text
\end{figure}

As you can see in Figure \ref{fig:latexlogo}, LATEX has its own official logo which represents its versatility and power in typesetting documents.
