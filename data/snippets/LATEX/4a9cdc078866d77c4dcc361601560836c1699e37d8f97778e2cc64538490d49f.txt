\begin{abstract}
This is a long and complex code snippet in the LATEX markup language.

%%% Introduction %%%
\section{Introduction}
LATEX is a powerful and widely used markup language for typesetting documents.
It offers various packages and tools for creating professional-looking documents with complex formatting and mathematical equations.

%%% Body %%%
\section{Body}
Here, we will demonstrate the use of some of LATEX's features, such as including images, creating tables, and using mathematical equations.
\vspace{5mm}

%%% Images %%%
\noindent\textbf{Images}\\
Images can be included in a LATEX document by using the \textit{graphicx} package.
We can specify the width and position of the image using the \textit{width} and \textit{wrapfigure} commands.
The following code snippet will include an image titled "example.png" with a width of 5 centimeters and positioned on the right side of the page.
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{5cm}
    \includegraphics[width=5cm]{example.png}
    \caption{An example image.}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{wrapfigure}
    
\end{verbatim}
\vspace{5mm}

\noindent\textbf{Tables}\\
Tables can be created in LATEX using the \textit{tabular} environment.
We can specify the number of columns, alignment, and content of the table using the alignment commands (\textit{l}, \textit{c}, \textit{r}) and the \textit{\&} symbol to separate columns.
The following code snippet will create a table with 3 columns and 3 rows, with the first column left-aligned, second column centered, and third column right-aligned.
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|r|}
    \hline
    Column 1 & Column 2 & Column 3 \\ 
    \hline
    Row 1, Column 1 & Row 1, Column 2 & Row 1, Column 3 \\ 
    \hline
    Row 2, Column 1 & Row 2, Column 2 & Row 2, Column 3 \\ 
    \hline
    Row 3, Column 1 & Row 3, Column 2 & Row 3, Column 3 \\ 
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{verbatim}
\vspace{5mm}

\noindent\textbf{Mathematical Equations}\\
LATEX is known for its ability to typeset mathematical equations with ease.
We can use the \textit{equation} environment to create numbered equations, or the \textit{align} environment to create multiple aligned equations.
We can also use various mathematical symbols and commands to create complex equations.
The following code snippet will create a numbered equation and an aligned equation with various symbols and commands.
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
    \int_0^1 x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}
\end{equation}

\begin{align*}
    x^2 + y^2 &= 1 \\ 
    \frac{d}{dx}\cos x &= -\sin x
\end{align*}
\end{verbatim}

%%% Conclusion %%%
\section{Conclusion}
In this example, we have shown some of the powerful features of LATEX and how they can be used to create complex and professional documents.
However, this is just a small glimpse of what LATEX is capable of, and there are many more advanced features and tools for creating even more complex and sophisticated documents.
