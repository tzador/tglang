Some math equations can be easily typeset in Latex. For example, the quadratic formula is given by:
 
\begin{equation*} % Starts a new equation 
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} % Adds the quadratic formula as an equation
\end{equation*}
 
Latex also allows for easy referencing of equations. The quadratic formula can be referenced as equation 1.

Subscripts and superscripts can also be easily added in Latex. For example, the function $f(x)=x^2$ is an example of a polynomial function. % Adds text to the document with an example of a superscript
