%% This is a comment in LaTeX, everything after the double percentage sign is ignored
\documentclass{article} % Defines the type of document as an article

%% Packages are used to extend the functionality of LaTeX
\usepackage{amsmath} % A package for typesetting math equations
\usepackage{graphicx} % A package for inserting graphics into the document
\usepackage{hyperref} % A package for adding hyperlinks within the document

%% Document begins here
\begin{document}
% Title page
\title{My Complex LaTeX Document} % Specifies the title of the document
\author{John Doe} % Specifies the author's name
\date{\today} % Specifies the current date

\maketitle % Generates the title page with the previously specified information

\tableofcontents % Generates a table of contents based on the document's sections

\section{Introduction} % Starts a new section titled "Introduction"
This section will introduce the reader to the document and its purpose.

\subsection{Objectives} % Starts a subsection within the "Introduction" section titled "Objectives"
The objectives of this document are:
\begin{itemize} % Begins a list
\item To demonstrate the use of LaTeX for creating complex documents
\item To showcase various packages and their functionality
\item To provide a comprehensive guide for document creation in LaTeX
\end{itemize} % Ends the list

\section{Mathematical Equations} % Starts a new section titled "Mathematical Equations"
LaTeX is known for its powerful capabilities in typesetting mathematical equations. Here are some examples:

\subsection{The Pythagorean Theorem} % Starts a subsection within the "Mathematical Equations" section titled "The Pythagorean Theorem"
The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most well-known equations in mathematics:
\begin{equation} % Begins an equation environment
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 % Specifies the equation to be typeset
\end{equation} % Ends the equation environment

\subsection{The Quadratic Formula} % Starts a subsection within the "Mathematical Equations" section titled "The Quadratic Formula"
The quadratic formula is used to find the roots of a quadratic equation:
\begin{equation} % Begins an equation environment
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} % Specifies the equation to be typeset
\end{equation} % Ends the equation environment

\section{Graphics} % Starts a new section titled "Graphics"
Graphics can easily be inserted into a LaTeX document. Here is an example:

\begin{figure}[h] % Begins a figure environment and specifies the placement of the figure (here, "h" means "here")
\centering % Centers the figure horizontally
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{example-image} % Inserts an image with a width of 5cm
\caption{Example Image} % Adds a caption to the image
\label{fig:example} % Adds a label for referencing the figure in the document
\end{figure} % Ends the figure environment

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:example}, graphics can easily be added and labeled within a LaTeX document.

\section{References} % Starts a new section titled "References"
LaTeX has the ability to create in-text citations and generate a bibliography based on these citations. Here is an example:

According to \citet{lamport1994latex}, LaTeX is a powerful typesetting language that is widely used in scientific and academic writing.

\bibliographystyle{plain} % Specifies the style for the bibliography
\bibliography{references} % Specifies the file containing the bibliography entries 

\end{document} % Ends the document
