\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % This package allows for proper input encoding
\usepackage[english]{babel} % This package sets the language to English
\usepackage{amsmath} % This package allows for advanced mathematical equations and symbols

\title{Sample LATEX Code} % This is the title of the document
\author{John Doe} % This is the author's name
\date{\today} % This is the date of the document

\begin{document} % This is the start of the actual document

\maketitle % This command creates the title on the document

\section{Introduction} % This creates a section titled "Introduction" in the document
This is a sample document written in LATEX, a typesetting language often used for scientific documents. % This is a regular text in the document

\section{Equations \& Symbols} % This creates a section titled "Equations & Symbols" in the document
In LATEX, we can use mathematical symbols and equations easily. For example, we can write the famous Pythagorean Theorem as: % This is a regular text in the document
\begin{equation} % This starts an equation environment
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 % This is the equation itself
\end{equation} % This ends the equation environment

\section{Graphics} % This creates a section titled "Graphics" in the document
We can also insert graphics in our LATEX documents. % This is a regular text in the document
\begin{figure}[ht] % This starts a figure environment with a "here" placement
\centering % This command centers the figure
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{sample_image.png} % This is the command to insert an image with a width of half the document's width
\caption{Sample Image} % This sets the caption for the figure
\label{fig:sample} % This assigns a label for cross-referencing
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:sample} shows a sample image that has been inserted into the document. % This is a regular text in the document

\section{Hyperlinks} % This creates a section titled "Hyperlinks" in the document
We can also add hyperlinks and cross-referencing in our document using the \textit{hyperref} package. For example, we can link to the sample image in Figure \ref{fig:sample} by using the command: % This is a regular text in the document
\href{sample_image.png}{Click here} % This creates a hyperlink to the sample image

\section{Conclusion} % This creates a section titled "Conclusion" in the document
This is just a small glimpse into what LATEX can do. It has many more features and functionalities that make it a popular choice for document typesetting. % This is a regular text in the document

\end{document} % This is the end of the document
