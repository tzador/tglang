\title{A Complex LaTeX Code Snippet} 
%This sets the title of the document
\author{John Smith} 
%This sets the author of the document
\date{\today} 
% This sets the date to be the current date

\begin{document} 
% This begins the document

\maketitle 
% This creates the title page using the previously defined information

\tableofcontents 
% This generates a table of contents for the document

\section{Introduction} 
% This creates a new section titled "Introduction"

Welcome to my complex LaTeX code snippet! 
% This adds plain text to the document

\section{Equations} 
% This creates a new section titled "Equations"

In this section, we will look at some of the math equations that can be created using LaTeX. 
% This adds plain text to the document

\subsection{Pythagorean Theorem} 
% This creates a subsection titled "Pythagorean Theorem"

The famous Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, the following equation holds: 
% This adds plain text to the document, along with inline math mode using the $ symbol

\begin{equation*} 
% This begins an unnumbered equation
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 
% This is the actual equation, using superscript and subscript notation
\end{equation*} 

\subsection{Complex Numbers} 
% This creates a subsection titled "Complex Numbers"

The set of complex numbers is represented by $\mathbb{C}$ and consists of numbers of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit. 
% This adds plain text to the document, along with inline math mode and the use of the \mathbb command for special math symbols

\section{Figures} 
% This creates a new section titled "Figures"

In this section, we will learn how to include figures in our LaTeX document. 
% This adds plain text to the document

\begin{figure}[h] 
% This creates a figure environment with options for placement, in this case, h means the figure should be placed "here"
\centering 
% This centers the figure
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example.png} 
% This includes an image with a specified width and file name
\caption{Example Figure} 
% This adds a caption to the figure
\label{fig:example} 
% This assigns a label to the figure for referencing later
\end{figure} 

Figure \ref{fig:example} shows an example figure that is included in our document. 
% This references the figure using the label assigned earlier, and adds plain text to the document
