% Include necessary packages
\documentclass[parskip=half]{scrartcl}  % Set document class to article with half paragraph skip
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % Set input encoding to UTF-8
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} % Use font encoding T1 for better font support
\usepackage{amsmath} % Import AMS math package for advanced mathematical typesetting
\usepackage{graphicx} % Include graphics package for including images
\usepackage{caption} % Allow for more complex captions for figures and tables

\title{Sample Document} % Set title of document
\author{John Doe} % Set author name
\date{\today} % Set date to current day

\begin{document} % Begin document
\maketitle % Add title, author, and date to document

\section{Introduction} % Add section title

Welcome to my sample document! In this document, we will explore the different functionalities of \LaTeX. % Add text

\section{Mathematical Equations} % Add another section

Let's start with some simple equations.  % Add text

\begin{equation} % Begin equation environment
E = mc^2 % Add equation
\end{equation} % End equation environment

This equation is also known as the famous mass-energy equivalence equation.

% Add another equation with multiple lines and an alignment symbol
\begin{align*} 
x^2 + y^2 &= r^2 \\
z^2 &= x^2 + y^2 
\end{align*}

\section{Including Graphics} % Add another section

We can easily include graphics in our document using the \texttt{graphicx} package. Let's add an image of a cat:

\begin{figure}[h] % Begin figure environment
    \centering % Center the image
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{cat.png} % Include image with width of half the page
    \caption{A cute cat} % Add caption
    \label{fig:cat} % Add label for referring to the figure in the text
\end{figure} % End figure environment

As we can see in Figure~\ref{fig:cat}, the cat is very cute!

\section{Conclusion} % Add final section

In conclusion, \LaTeX\ provides a powerful and customizable tool for creating documents with advanced mathematical equations and graphics. It may have a steep learning curve, but the results are worth it. Happy typesetting!
