%This is a sample LaTeX document
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article} %this command defines the type of document and its basic properties
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %this package allows the use of special characters
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} %this package allows the use of advanced fonts
\usepackage{amsmath} %this package adds support for advanced mathematical equations
\usepackage{graphicx} %this package enables the inclusion of images in the document
\usepackage{hyperref} %this package allows the creation of clickable hyperlinks in the document
\title{My LaTeX Document} %defines the title of the document
\author{John Smith} %defines the author of the document
\date{\today} %defines the date of the document, in this case, the current date is used
\begin{document} %begins the document
\maketitle %prints the title, author, and date on the document page
\tableofcontents %creates a table of contents based on sections and subsections
\section{Introduction} %starts a new section
This is the first section of the document. %text inside the section
In this section, we will introduce some basic concepts of LaTeX and its syntax.
\subsection{Basic Syntax} %starts a subsection
The basic syntax of LaTeX is simple. It follows a markup language approach, where commands are defined by a backslash. %text inside the subsection
For example, to create a new section, we use the command \verb|\section{Section Title}|, where the section title is written inside the curly braces.
\subsection{Mathematical Equations} %starts another subsection
LaTeX is widely used for writing mathematical equations. %text inside the subsection
It has a built-in support for various mathematical symbols and functions. For example, the command \verb|$f(x) = \frac{x^2}{2}$| will produce the equation $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{2}$.
\subsubsection{Aligning Equations} %starts a subsubsection
In order to align equations in LaTeX, we use the \texttt{align} environment from the \texttt{amsmath} package. %text inside the subsubsection
This allows us to align multiple equations at a specific point using the ampersand (\&) symbol. For example,
\begin{align} %starts the align environment
x + y &= 3 \\ %the double backslash (\\) ends the line
2x - y &= 1
\end{align}
This will produce the following aligned equations:
\begin{align}
x + y &= 3 \\
2x - y &= 1
\end{align}
\section{Conclusion} %starts another section
This is the last section of the document. %text inside the section
In this section, we have discussed some basic concepts of LaTeX and its usage for mathematical equations. %text inside the section
We have also seen how to align equations using the \texttt{align} environment. %text inside the section
