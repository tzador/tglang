\documentclass{article} % declares the type of document
\usepackage{amsmath} % used for advanced math equations
\usepackage{graphicx} % used for including images

\title{Complex LaTeX Code Snippet} % title of the document
\author{John Smith} % author of the document
\date{October 2019} % date of submission

\begin{document} % begins the document

\maketitle % generates the title

\section{Introduction} % creates a new section
In this section, we will learn how to write a complex code snippet in LaTeX. \\

To start, we will need to declare the type of document we are creating. This is done using the \textit{documentclass} command. For this example, we will use the \textit{article} document class. \\

After declaring the document class, we can use various packages to enhance our document. Here, we will use the \textit{amsmath} package for advanced math equations and the \textit{graphicx} package for including images. \\

Next, we will add a title, author, and date to our document using the \textit{title}, \textit{author}, and \textit{date} commands. % provides metadata for the document

\subsection{Code Snippet} % creates a new subsection
Now, let's dive into the code snippet. \\

To begin, we will declare the \textit{begin} and \textit{end} tags for the document using the \textit{document} command. This tells LaTeX where the main body of the document begins and ends. \\

We can then use the \textit{maketitle} command to generate the title we previously declared. \\

Next, we want to add a section to our document using the \textit{section} command. This allows us to organize our document into different sections. Here, we will add an introduction section. \\

Inside the introduction section, we use the regular text formatting to provide an overview of what we will learn in this document. We can also use the \textit{\\} command to add a line break. \\

In the next line, we will use the \textit{textit} command to italicize the word \textit{documentclass}. We can also use other formatting commands such as \textit{textbf} for bold and \textit{textsc} for small caps. \\

To add a comment in our code, we use the \textit{%} symbol and anything after it will not be compiled. This allows us to provide notes and explanations within our code. \\

In the next line, we use the \textit{textit} command again to italicize the word \textit{article}. This is the specific document class we are using. \\

Next, we use the \textit{\\} command again to add a line break. We can then declare the packages we want to use using the \textit{usepackage} command. Here, we declare the \textit{amsmath} and \textit{graphicx} packages. \\

After declaring the packages, we can add the metadata for our document using the \textit{title}, \textit{author}, and \textit{date} commands. \\

Finally, we end our document using the \textit{end} command. This signifies the end of our main body and any additional text or commands after this will not be compiled. \\

Congratulations, you have successfully created a complex code snippet in LaTeX!

\end{document} % ends the document
