\documentclass{article}
% This is a document class declaration in LATEX

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% This package allows for input of characters in UTF-8 encoding

\usepackage{amsmath}
% This package provides various math- and equation-related commands and environments

\usepackage{graphicx}

\title{My Complex LATEX Code}
\author{John Doe}
\date{\today}
% These lines define the title, author, and date of the document

\begin{document}
% The document environment is where the content of the document is placed

\maketitle
% This command creates the title based on the information provided in the header

\tableofcontents
% This command creates a table of contents based on the sections and subsections found in the document

\section{Introduction}
% This command creates a new section

This is a complex LATEX code snippet that showcases the different features and packages available for document formatting and typesetting.

\subsection{Equations}
% This command creates a subsection within the current section

Equations can be easily typeset using the \verb|equation| environment. For example, the Pythagorean theorem can be written as:

\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
% The equation is enclosed in the "equation" environment to align it properly and add a number for referencing
\end{equation}

Mathematical symbols such as Greek letters can also be included using the proper commands, like \verb|\alpha| for $\alpha$ and \verb|\beta| for $\beta$.

\subsection{Tables}
% This creates another subsection

Tables can be created using the \verb|tabular| environment, as shown in the example below:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
% The "table" environment creates a floating table, while the "centering" command centers the table horizontally
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
% "c" stands for "centered" and "|" is used to create vertical lines in the table
\hline % "hline" creates a horizontal line in the table
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Age} & \textbf{Country} \\
% The "&" symbol is used to separate columns in the table
\hline
John & 25 & USA \\
\hline
Maria & 30 & Germany \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Sample table}
% The "caption" command creates a title for the table
\label{tab:sample}
% The "label" command assigns a label to the table for referencing it in the document
\end{table}

We can reference this table using its label, like Table~\ref{tab:sample}.

\subsection{Figures}
% Another subsection

Figures can be included in the document using the \verb|includegraphics| command, like in the example below:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
% The "figure" environment creates a floating figure, while the "centering" command centers it horizontally
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image}
% The options within the brackets are used to set the width of the image, and the curly braces contain the image file name
\caption{Sample figure}
% The "caption" command creates a title for the figure
\label{fig:sample}
% The "label" command assigns a label to the figure for referencing it in the document
\end{figure}

We can reference this figure using its label, like Figure~\ref{fig:sample}.

\section{Conclusion}
% A new section

In conclusion, LATEX offers a powerful and versatile way to create professional-looking documents with complex mathematical equations, tables, and figures. With its various packages and features, it makes typesetting a breeze.
