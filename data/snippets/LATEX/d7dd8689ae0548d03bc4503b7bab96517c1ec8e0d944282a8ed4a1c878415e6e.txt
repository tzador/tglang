\section{Introduction} %introduction section
In this section, we will discuss the purpose of this document and the background information needed to understand the code.

\section{Code} %code section
\textbf{Code example:}

\begin{verbatim} %verbatim environment used to display code as it is
    \begin{equation} %begin equation environment
    \int_{0}^{1} 2x + 3 \ dx = \left[\ x^2 + 3x \ \right]_{0}^{1} = 4 \label{eq:example} %equation with label for referencing
    \end{equation} %end equation environment
\end{verbatim}

Equation (\ref{eq:example}) is a simple example of a mathematical expression written in LaTeX. It showcases the use of the \texttt{equation} environment and the use of the \texttt{label} command for future referencing. 

\section{Conclusion} %conclusion section
In conclusion, LaTeX is a powerful programming language used for creating professional and complex documents. It offers a wide range of packages and features for efficient document creation. This code snippet is just a small example of the many possibilities that LaTeX offers.
