In this paper, we will explore the properties of prime numbers.

\subsection{Definition} % Begins a new subsection in the document

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

\section{Proof of Prime Number Theorem} % Begins a new section in the document

Consider the sequence of prime numbers, denoted by $P_n = \{2,3,5,7,11,...\}$. We can define the prime counting function, $\pi(x)$, as the number of primes less than or equal to a given number $x$.

By mathematical induction, we can prove that $\pi(x) \approx \frac{x}{\ln(x)}$, where $\ln(x)$ is the natural logarithm. This is known as the Prime Number Theorem.

\begin{equation} % Begins an equation environment
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\pi(x)}{\frac{x}{\ln(x)}} = 1 % Sets the equation to be the limit as x approaches infinity
\end{equation}

\section{Conclusion} % Begins a new section in the document

In conclusion, we have shown the fundamental properties of prime numbers and proven the well-known Prime Number Theorem. This is just a small glimpse into the vast world of mathematics, and there are still countless mysteries waiting to be discovered.
