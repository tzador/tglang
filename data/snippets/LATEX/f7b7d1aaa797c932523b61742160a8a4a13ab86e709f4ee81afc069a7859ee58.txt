\section{Introduction} %defining a section
This is a sample document written in \LaTeX. % \LaTeX is used to print the LaTeX logo
It showcases various features and commands of \LaTeX.

\subsection{Formatting} %defining a subsection
\label{subsec:formatting} %giving the subsection a label
\textit{Italic}, \textbf{bold} and \underline{underlined} text can easily be generated in \LaTeX.

\subsubsection*{Formatting fonts} %defining a subsubsection without numbering
Fonts can be formatted using commands such as \texttt{\textbackslash textit\{\}} for italics, \texttt{\textbackslash textbf\{\}} for bold and \texttt{\textbackslash underline\{\}} for underlined text.

\paragraph{Paragraphs} %defining a paragraph
Paragraphs can be created using the \texttt{\textbackslash paragraph\{\}} command.

\subsection{Mathematical Equations}
LaTeX has advanced features for typesetting mathematical expressions and equations.

\begin{equation} %using the equation environment for numbered equations
    f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2
\end{equation}

\begin{gather} %using the gather environment for multiple equations
    a = b + c \\
    b = 2c \\
    \therefore a = 2c + c = 3c
\end{gather}

\subsection{Including Images}
Images can easily be included in a LaTeX document using the \textit{graphicx} package.

\begin{figure} %using the figure environment for adding figures
    \centering %centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{sampleimage.jpg} %inserts the image with a width of half the text width
    \caption{Sample Image} %adds a caption to the image
    \label{fig:sampleimage} %gives the image a label for referencing in the text
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:sampleimage}, images can be easily inserted and referenced in \LaTeX.

\section{Conclusion}
This document showcases various features and commands of \LaTeX. It is a powerful tool for typesetting documents with advanced formatting and mathematical equations.
