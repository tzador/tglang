%\chapter{Introduction}                % Creating a new chapter
%This is a sample code snippet in \LaTeX. % Writing a basic text in the chapter
%Here we can see how to use different packages and commands in \LaTeX. % Adding another sentence

%\section{Basic Commands}              % Creating a new section
%In \LaTeX, we can use various basic commands to format our text such as \textbf{bold}, \textit{italic}, and \underline{underline}. % Using basic formatting commands to emphasize text

%\subsection{Math Functions}           % Creating a new subsection
%\LaTeX\ is widely used for typesetting mathematical equations and formulas. % Adding a sentence
%Using the 'amsmath' package, we can easily write equations and use various math functions such as $\sin$, $\cos$, and $\sum$. % Writing an equation using math functions

%\subsection{Adding Images}            % Creating another subsection
%To add images in \LaTeX, we first need to import the 'graphicx' package. % Adding a sentence
%Then, we can use the \texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics} command to insert the image with options to adjust its size, positioning, and caption. % Using a command to insert image with options

%\subsubsection{Example}               % Creating a sub-subsection
%Here is an example of an image inserted in \LaTeX: % Adding a sentence
%\begin{figure}[h]                     % Creating a 'figure' environment with 'h' option for positioning
%    \centering                        % Using the \centering command to align the image at the center
%    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{image.jpg} % Inserting the image with 50% of the line width
%    \caption{My Image}                % Adding a caption below the image
%    \label{fig:myimage}               % Adding a label to refer to the image in the document
%\end{figure}
