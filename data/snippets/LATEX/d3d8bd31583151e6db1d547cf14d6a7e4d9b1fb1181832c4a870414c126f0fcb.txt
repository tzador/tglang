\documentclass{article} % defining the document class
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % importing a package for special characters
\usepackage{amsmath} % importing a package for advanced math
\title{My Complex Document} % creating a title for the document
\author{John Doe} % defining the author
\date{\today} % setting the date to today

\begin{document} % starting the document
\maketitle % creating the title page

\section{Introduction} % creating a section for the introduction
This document is a demonstration of how complex code snippets can be generated in \LaTeX. \\ % adding a line break
Since \LaTeX is a markup language, it is easier to format and design documents compared to traditional coding languages. \\

\section{The Code} % creating a section for the code snippet
The following code snippet includes various commands and packages to create a table of contents for the document.

\begin{verbatim} % starting the verbatim environment for unformatted text
\tableofcontents % creating the table of contents
\thispagestyle{empty} % removing page numbering for the table of contents
\newpage % creating a new page
\pagenumbering{roman} % changing page numbering to roman numerals
\setcounter{page}{1} % setting page number to 1
\end{verbatim}
 
\subsection{Adding Sections} % creating a subsection for adding sections to the table of contents
To add a section to the table of contents, use the ``\textbackslash section" command followed by the title in curly brackets. \\ % using double backslashes for line break
For example: \\
\textbackslash section\{Introduction\} \\

\subsection{Adding Subsections}
Similarly, to add a subsection, use the ``\textbackslash subsection" command followed by the title in curly brackets. \\ % using double backslashes for line break
For example: \\
\textbackslash subsection\{Adding Sections\}

\subsection{Page Numbering and Formatting}
To change the numbering and formatting of the table of contents, use the ``\textbackslash pagenumbering" and ``\textbackslash setcounter" commands. \\ % using double backslashes for line break
For example: \\
\textbackslash pagenumbering\{arabic\} \\
\textbackslash setcounter\{page\}\{1\}

\section{Conclusion} % creating a section for the conclusion
In conclusion, \LaTeX is a powerful and flexible language for creating complex documents with ease. With the use of various packages and commands, creating a table of contents or other advanced features can be done seamlessly. This makes \LaTeX a popular choice for academics and professionals in various fields.
