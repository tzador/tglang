% Abstract
\begin{abstract} % starts the abstract section
This is a long and complex document created with Latex. Latex is a powerful typesetting system used for writing technical and scientific documents. It is especially useful for dealing with mathematical equations and symbols.
\end{abstract} % ends the abstract section

% Introduction
\section{Introduction} % starts a new section titled "Introduction"
In this section, we will introduce the topic of our document and provide some background information.

Latex is pronounced "lay-tek" and is based on the idea of separating the content and formatting of a document. This allows for easy editing and customization of the document's appearance.
\vspace{5mm} % adds a 5mm space before the next paragraph

% Body
\section{Body} % starts a new section titled "Body"
Latex uses markup tags to format text. For example, to make text bold, we use the \textbf{bold} tag. To make text italic, we use the \textit{italic} tag.

Latex also allows for the inclusion of mathematical expressions using the \textbf{equation} environment. For example,
\begin{equation}
    F = ma
\end{equation}

% Conclusion
\section{Conclusion} % starts a new section titled "Conclusion"
In this document, we have explored the basics of Latex and its capabilities. This type of typesetting system offers a lot of flexibility and power for creating complex documents.
