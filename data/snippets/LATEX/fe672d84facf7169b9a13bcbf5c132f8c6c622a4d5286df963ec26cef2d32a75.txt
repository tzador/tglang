\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article} %This is the document class we will be using, with font size 12pt and paper type A4
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %We need this package to use unicode characters like é, á, ü, etc.
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} %This package allows us to use characters from different fonts
\usepackage{amsmath} %This package gives us more mathematical options
\usepackage{graphicx} %This package enables the use of images in our document
\title{My First Document} %Title of our document
\author{John Smith} %The author's name
\date{\today} %The date automatically updates whenever the document is compiled
\begin{document} %Begins the document
\maketitle %This inserts the title, author, and date at the beginning of the document
\section{Introduction} %Creates a new section titled 'Introduction'
This is my first document written in \LaTeX. \\ %The '\\' is used to insert a line break
I am excited to learn more about this powerful typesetting tool. %Text in this section
\subsection{History} %Creates a subsection titled 'History' within the 'Introduction' section
\LaTeX{} was created by Leslie Lamport in the 1980s as a set of macros for the \TeX{} typesetting system. %Text in this subsection
\section{Mathematics} %Creates a new section titled 'Mathematics'
\subsection{Equations} %Creates a subsection titled 'Equations' within the 'Mathematics' section
Here is an example of the famous Pythagorean theorem: %Text in this subsection
\begin{equation} %Begins an equation environment
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 %Actual equation written in LaTeX syntax
\end{equation} %Ends the equation environment
\subsection{Matrices}  %Creates a subsection titled 'Matrices' within the 'Mathematics' section
Matrices can also be easily written in \LaTeX: %Text in this subsection
\begin{equation}
A = \begin{bmatrix} %Begins a matrix environment with brackets
1 & 2 & 3 \\ %First row of the matrix with elements separated by '&' symbol
4 & 5 & 6 \\ %Second row of the matrix
7 & 8 & 9 %Third row of the matrix
\end{bmatrix} %Ends the matrix environment
\end{equation} %Ends the equation environment
\section{Figures} %Creates a new section titled 'Figures'
We can also include images in our document, like this picture of a cute kitten: %Text in this section
\begin{figure}[h] %Begins a figure environment, with 'h' indicating placement 'here'
