In this document, we will explore some complex equations and their solutions. 

\subsection{Quadratic Equation} %create subsection
The general form of a quadratic equation is given by: 
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$ %use math display mode

To solve this equation, we can use the quadratic formula: 
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$ %use math display mode

\subsection{Pythagorean Theorem} %create subsection
The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($c$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ($a$ and $b$). This can be represented by the equation: 
$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$$ %use math display mode

\subsection{Euler's Identity} %create subsection
Euler's identity, often cited as one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics, is given by: 
$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$ %use math display mode

This equation combines five of the most fundamental constants in mathematics: $e$, $i$, $\pi$, $1$, and $0$. It also connects three important branches of mathematics: calculus, algebra, and geometry.
