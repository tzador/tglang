    \subsection{Equations} % creating a subsection titled "Equations"
    To demonstrate the use of equations, we will start with the famous Euler's formula: % adding text to the subsection
    \begin{equation} % starting an equation
        e^{i\pi}=-1 % defining the equation
    \end{equation} % ending the equation
    Another commonly used equation is the Pythagorean theorem: % adding text to the subsection
    \begin{equation} % starting an equation
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2 % defining the equation
    \end{equation} % ending the equation
