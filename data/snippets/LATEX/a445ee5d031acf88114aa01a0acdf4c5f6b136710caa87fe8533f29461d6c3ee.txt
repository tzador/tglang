\section{Introduction}
LATEX is a powerful typesetting system that is widely used for creating documents with complex equations and formatting. In this document, we will showcase a long and complex code snippet in LATEX.

\section{Code Snippet}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX, caption=Complex Code Snippet in LATEX]
\usepackage{tikz} %Adds support for creating diagrams and graphics within the document

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5] %Sets the scale of the diagram
\draw (0,0) rectangle (4,4); %Draws a rectangle with coordinates (0,0) for the bottom left corner and (4,4) for the top right corner
\draw (2,2) circle (2); %Draws a circle with center at (2,2) and a radius of 2 units
\draw (0,0) -- (2,2) -- (4,0); %Draws a line from (0,0) to (2,2) to (4,0)
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{lstlisting}

The above code snippet uses the tikz package to create a simple diagram with a rectangle, circle, and connecting lines. This is just one example of the many possibilities for creating graphics in LATEX.

\section{Conclusion}

Creating complex documents in LATEX may require a steep learning curve, but with the use of different packages and techniques, it is possible to achieve professional-quality results. This code snippet is just a small glimpse into the power of LATEX and its capabilities.
