\documentclass{article} % Specifies the document class

\usepackage{amsmath} % Imports the amsmath package

\title{Complex Code Snippet} % Specifies the title of the document
\author{John Doe} % Specifies the author of the document
\date{\today} % Specifies the date of the document, which automatically sets it to the current date

\begin{document} % Begins the document

\maketitle % Creates the title page with the specified title, author, and date

\section{Introduction} 

This code snippet showcases the use of various LaTeX packages and commands to create a more complex document structure.

% This is a subsection heading
\subsection{Equations} 

The amsmath package allows for the easy insertion of several types of equations, such as the popular mathematical notation for summation:

% This is an equation environment
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{equation}

LaTeX also has commands for aligning equations, such as the align environment:

% This is an align environment
\begin{align*}
    x + y &= 5 \\
    2x - 3y &= 4
\end{align*}

\subsection{Tables}

The tabular environment can be used to create tables with specified columns and cell contents. An example of a table that displays data about fruits is shown below:

% This is a tabular environment
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Fruit} & \textbf{Color} & \textbf{Price (per kg)} \\ \hline
    Apple & Red & \$3.00 \\ \hline
    Banana & Yellow & \$2.50 \\ \hline
    Orange & Orange & \$2.75 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Graphics}

The graphicx package allows for the insertion of images into the document. The following code snippet inserts an image called "tree.png" and scales it to a width of 0.5\textwidth:

% This is a figure environment
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{tree.png}
    \caption{A tree in the forest.}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}

This concludes our example of a complex LaTeX code snippet. With the use of various packages and commands, we were able to create a professional-looking document with equations, tables, and graphics. Happy LaTeXing!
