\section{Introduction}
%Creating a section titled "Introduction"

This is a long and complex code snippet showcasing the various functionalities of LATEX. 
We will be using different packages and commands to create a visually appealing and well-structured document.

\section{Equations}
%Creating a section titled "Equations"

One of the most powerful features of LATEX is the ability to write complex mathematical equations. 
We can use the \textit{amsmath} package to achieve this.

\subsection{Pythagorean Theorem}
%Creating a subsection titled "Pythagorean Theorem"

The Pythagorean theorem can be written as:
\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]
%Writing the equation using the "display style" command to ensure proper alignment and spacing

Where, \(a\) and \(b\) represents the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle, and \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse.

\subsection{Derivatives and Integrals}
%Creating a subsection titled "Derivatives and Integrals"

We can also write derivatives and integrals using LATEX. 
For example, the derivative of \(f(x)\) can be written as:
\[\frac{df(x)}{dx}\]
%Using the "frac" command to create a fraction and specifying the numerator and denominator

Similarly, the integral of \(f(x)\) can be written as:
\[\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx\]
%Using the "int" command and specifying the lower and upper limits, the function, and the variable of integration

\section{Tables and Figures}
%Creating a section titled "Tables and Figures"

We can also create tables and figures in LATEX using the \textit{tabular} and \textit{graphicx} packages respectively.

\subsection{Table Example}
%Creating a subsection titled "Table Example"

We can generate a table with multiple columns and rows as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} & \textbf{Column 3}\\
	\hline
	Row 1 & 1 & a\\
	\hline
	Row 2 & 2 & b\\
	\hline
	Row 3 & 3 & c\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Figure Example}
%Creating a subsection titled "Figure Example"

We can also include images in our document using the \textit{includegraphics} command. 
For example, we can insert a figure with a width of 0.5\textbackslash textwidth as:
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg}
    \caption{Example figure}
    %Adding a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:example}
    %Creating a label for reference in the text
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}
%Creating a section titled "Conclusion"

In this code snippet, we have seen how to use different packages and commands in LATEX to create a complex and well-structured document. 
There are many more features and possibilities with LATEX, making it a popular choice among academics and professionals for creating technical documents.
