\begin{document} % start of document

\title{My First LaTeX Document} % assigning a title
\author{John Doe} % assigning an author
\date{\today} % automatically inserting today's date

\maketitle % command to create title based on above information

\tableofcontents % automatically generate table of contents

% This is a comment
\section{Introduction} % creating a section titled Introduction
LaTeX is a typesetting system used for documents containing technical and scientific content. % adding text within the section

\subsection{History} % creating a subsection titled History
LaTeX was created in 1984 by Leslie Lamport and is based on the TeX typesetting system by Donald Knuth. % adding text within the subsection

\section{Basic Formatting} % creating another section titled Basic Formatting
This section will cover some basic formatting techniques in LaTeX such as \textbf{bold}, \textit{italics}, and \underline{underline}. % using text formatting commands within a section

\section{Math Equations} % creating another section titled Math Equations
LaTeX is particularly popular for its ability to typeset complex math equations. For example, the famous \textit{Euler's identity} can be written as: % adding text within a section

\[e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0\] % creating a math equation using LaTeX syntax

LaTeX also has built-in commands for symbols and operators, such as the \textit{infinity symbol} $\infty$ and the \textit{integral operator} $\int$. % using math symbols and operators within a section

\section{Figures} % creating another section titled Figures
Figures can easily be inserted into a LaTeX document using the \texttt{graphicx} package. For example, the code to insert a figure named \textit{myfigure.jpg} is: % adding text within a section

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{myfigure.jpg}
    \caption{My Figure}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim} % inserting code using verbatim environment for code blocks

This will create a floating figure with a centered caption and reference label for easy referencing.

\section{Hyperlinks} % creating another section titled Hyperlinks
Hyperlinks can be added to a LaTeX document using the \texttt{hyperref} package. For example, to add a hyperlink to \textit{Google}, the code is: % adding text within a section

\begin{verbatim}
\href{https://www.google.com}{Google}
\end{verbatim} % inserting code using verbatim environment for code blocks

This will create a clickable link that directs the reader to the specified URL.
