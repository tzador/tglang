\maketitle %Generates the title page with the information provided above

\section{Introduction} %Starts the first section

This is a long and complex code snippet written in \LaTeX. %Creates a sentence with the phrase "LaTeX" formatted with the \LaTeX logo command.

\section{Equations} %Starts the second section

In this section, we will see how equations can be written in \LaTeX. %Creates a sentence that introduces the topic of equations.

\subsection{Pythagorean Theorem} %Starts a subsection with the Pythagorean theorem.

The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. %Creates a sentence explaining the Pythagorean theorem.

In math notation, this can be represented as: %Starts a new paragraph.

$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$$ %Prints the equation for the Pythagorean theorem in the format of a displayed math equation.

Where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the other two sides, and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse. %Creates a sentence explaining the variables used in the equation.

\subsection{Euler's Identity} %Starts another subsection with Euler's Identity.

Euler's Identity is a famous equation in mathematics that relates the five most important constants: $e$, $i$, $\pi$, $0$ and $1$. %Creates a sentence explaining Euler's Identity.

In \LaTeX, this can be represented as: %Starts a new paragraph.

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$ %Prints the equation for Euler's Identity in the format of a displayed math equation.

This equation has been called "the most beautiful equation in mathematics" due to its elegant and simple form. %Creates a sentence explaining the significance of Euler's Identity.

\section{Graphics} %Starts the third section

In this section, we will see how to include graphics in our \LaTeX document. %Creates a sentence that introduces the topic of graphics.

\begin{figure}[h] %Starts a figure environment with the positioning option of "here". This will allow the graphic to be placed where it appears in the code.
\centering %Centers the graphic on the page.
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image} %Includes a graphics file with the given width, set to half of the text width.
\caption{An example graphic.} %Creates a caption for the graphic.
\end{figure} %Ends the figure environment.

This is an example of a graphic included in our document. %Creates a sentence referencing the included graphic.

\end{document} %Ends the main document.
