\documentclass{article} % This specifies what type of document we are creating
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % This specifies the character encoding used in the document
\usepackage{amsmath} % This package provides additional math functionality
\usepackage{graphicx} % This package is used to insert images

\begin{document}

\title{My First Document} % Title of the document
\author{John Doe} % Author's name
\date{\today} % Current date will be added

\maketitle % This creates the title page

\section{Introduction} % This creates a new section titled "Introduction"

Welcome to my first document! This is where I will show you how to use some basic \LaTeX{} commands.

\section{Mathematics} % This creates a new section titled "Mathematics"

Let's begin with some simple equations. Here's a quadratic equation:

\begin{equation} % This creates an equation environment
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
\end{equation}

We can also create fractions using the \verb|\frac| command, like this: 

\begin{equation}
\frac{a}{b}
\end{equation}

\section{Inserting Images}

We can also insert images in our document. Here's how you do it:

\begin{figure}[h] % This creates a floating figure environment
\centering % This centers the image
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.png} % This includes the image with a width of half the text width
\caption{My First Image} % This creates a caption for the image
\label{fig:myimage} % This assigns a label to the image for referencing
\end{figure}

Now we can refer to this image using its label, like this: Figure \ref{fig:myimage} shows my first image.

\end{document} % This closes the document environment
