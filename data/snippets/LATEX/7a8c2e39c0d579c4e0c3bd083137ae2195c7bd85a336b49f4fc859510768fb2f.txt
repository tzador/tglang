\section{Introduction} % Creating introduction section

Here is where we will introduce our code snippet and give some background information on what it will showcase.

\section{Basic Formatting} % Creating section for basic formatting

\subsection{Fonts} % Creating subsection for font formatting
We can \textbf{bold}, \textit{italicize}, \underline{underline}, and \texttt{type in monospace font} using various commands in LATEX.

\subsection{Lists} % Creating subsection for lists
We can create \textbf{numbered lists} and \textit{bullet points} with the "enumerate" and "itemize" environments, respectively.

\subsection{Tables} % Creating subsection for tables
We can create professional-looking tables with the "tabular" environment and specify the alignment, borders, cell spacing, and more.

\subsection{Figures} % Creating subsection for figures
We can include figures in our document using the "figure" environment and specify the placement, size, and caption for the figure.

\section{Math Equations} % Creating section for math equations
Next, we will showcase how LATEX makes writing math equations simple and beautiful.

\subsection{Inline Equations} % Creating subsection for inline equations
We can write inline equations using the "$" symbols. For example, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

\subsection{Display Equations} % Creating subsection for display equations
We can write display equations using the "equation" environment. For example,

\begin{equation*} % Using equation* to remove equation number 
    \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(x) dx = 2
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Aligning Equations} % Creating subsection for aligning equations
We can align multiple equations at a specific point using the "align" environment.

\begin{align*} % Using align* to remove equation number 
    a + b &= c \\
    b - a &= d
\end{align*}

\section{Conclusion} % Creating conclusion section
This concludes our complex code snippet in LATEX. As you can see, LATEX offers a wide range of features and packages that make document creation efficient and professional. Happy coding!
