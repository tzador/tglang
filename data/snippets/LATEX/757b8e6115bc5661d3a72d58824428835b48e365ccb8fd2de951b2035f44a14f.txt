\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %enables the use of utf-8 characters
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} %sets the font encoding to T1
\usepackage{graphicx} %enables the use of graphics
\usepackage{amsmath} %enables advanced mathematical equations

\title{Title of Document} %sets the title of the document
\author{Author Name} %sets the author of the document
\date{\today} %sets the date as today's date

\begin{document} %starts the document
\maketitle %inserts the title, author, and date at the beginning of the document

\section{Introduction} %starts a new section with the title Introduction
This is a \textit{test document} to demonstrate the use of various \LaTeX\ commands. %inserts italicized text and uses \LaTeX\ command for the logo

\subsection{Equations} %starts a subsection with the title Equations
In the field of mathematics, equations play a crucial role in representing relationships between variables. Here are some examples of equations:
\begin{equation} %starts an equation environment
    e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n %inserts the Euler's number formula using \lim and \to commands
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{x^2}{x + 3}\,dx %inserts a calculus integral using \int command
\end{equation}

\subsection{Figures} %starts another subsection with the title Figures
Figures are commonly used in documents to represent data or illustrate concepts. Here is an example of a figure:
\begin{figure}[h] %starts a figure environment, [h] specifies that the figure should be placed here
    \centering %centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image-a} %inserts an image with a width of half the text width, using a sample image from the graphicx package
    \caption{Example figure} %sets the figure caption
    \label{fig:example} %sets a label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables} %starts a subsection with the title Tables
Tables are used to present data in an organized and logical manner. Here is an example of a table:
\begin{table}[h] %starts a table environment, [h] specifies that the table should be placed here
    \centering %centers the table
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} %specifies the format for the columns, in this case three centered columns with vertical lines between them
        \hline %inserts a horizontal line
        \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Age} & \textbf{Occupation} \\ %sets the column headers in bold font
        \hline
        John & 25 & Student \\ %inserts a row with three columns
        \hline
        Emily & 35 & Doctor \\
        \hline
        David & 42 & Engineer \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Example table} %sets the table caption
    \label{tab:example} %sets a label for referencing the table
\end{table}

\section{Conclusion} %starts a new section with the title Conclusion
In conclusion, \LaTeX\ is a powerful typesetting tool that allows for the creation of professional-looking documents with advanced features for equations, figures, and tables. It has a steep learning curve, but with practice, one can create beautifully formatted documents in no time. %concludes the document
