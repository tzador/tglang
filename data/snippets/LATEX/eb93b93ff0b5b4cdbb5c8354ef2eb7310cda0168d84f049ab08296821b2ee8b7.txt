\section{Introduction} % Creating a section
Welcome to my code snippet! This snippet is designed to showcase my skills in Latex and how I can effectively write complex and structured documents using this markup language. In this snippet, I will be demonstrating various features of Latex such as typesetting equations, creating new commands, and including graphics.

\section{Typesetting equations}
Equations are an essential part of any scientific document and Latex makes it very easy to typeset complex equations. Here's an example of a quadratic equation:
\begin{equation*} % Creating an unnumbered equation
    ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\end{equation*}
And here's an example of a system of equations:
\begin{align*} % Creating a multiline equation
    x + y &= 5\\ % Using the & symbol to align equations
    2x - y &= 11
\end{align*}
Latex also allows us to number each equation:
\begin{equation} % Creating a numbered equation
    E = mc^2
\end{equation}

\section{Defining new commands}
Latex provides the ability to create new commands that can make writing and formatting easier. Here are a couple of examples:
\begin{itemize} % Creating a bulleted list
    \item $\code{int}$: This command is used for formatting integrals in equations.
    \item $\code{blank}$: This command is used to add vertical space between paragraphs.
\end{itemize}
We can also define new commands with parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\code{\textbackslash thypot}$: This command calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the two other sides, $a$ and $b$.
    \item Syntax: $\code{\textbackslash thypot\{a\}\{b\}}$
\end{itemize}
Example: Let $a = 3$ and $b = 4$, then $\code{\textbackslash thypot\{3\}\{4\}}$ gives us the hypotenuse of 5.

\section{Including graphics}
Latex also allows us to include graphics in our document. Here's an example of inserting an image with a caption and reference:
\begin{figure}[h] % Creating a float for the image with placement specifier 'h' (here)
    \centering % Center aligning the image
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{plot} % Inserting the image with a specified width
    \caption{Example plot} % Setting the caption of the image
    \label{fig:plot} % Label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:plot} shows a plot of a sine function.

\section{Conclusion} % Creating a section
In conclusion, Latex is a powerful markup language that allows for easy and efficient creation of complex documents. With its various features such as typesetting equations, defining new commands, and including graphics, it is a highly versatile tool for any type of document creation. I hope this code snippet has effectively demonstrated my skills in Latex. Thank you for reading!
