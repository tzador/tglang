\section{Introduction} %introduction section
This document aims to introduce the basics of \LaTeX{} and demonstrate its usefulness in creating documents with mathematical equations.

\section{Equations} %equations section
One of the main advantages of \LaTeX{} is its ability to easily typeset complex mathematical equations. For example, the equation of a circle can be written as

\begin{equation*} %equation environment, * to remove equation number
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
\end{equation*}

where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of a point on the circle and $r$ is the radius. 

\section{Tables} %tables section
Tables can also be easily created in \LaTeX{}, as seen below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} %tabular environment, | for vertical lines, c for centered columns
\hline
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Age} & \textbf{Occupation} \\ %table headers
\hline
John & 25 & Engineer \\ %table rows
\hline
Jane & 30 & Teacher \\
\hline
Mark & 40 & Lawyer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Conclusion} %conclusion section
This document has introduced the basic elements of \LaTeX{} and highlighted its usefulness in creating documents with mathematical equations and tables. With further practice and exploration, one can create professional-looking documents with ease using \LaTeX{}.
