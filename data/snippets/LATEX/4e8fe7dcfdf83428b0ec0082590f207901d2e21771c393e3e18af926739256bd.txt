Hello, welcome to my document! Here is some text introduction.
This document will cover various topics including mathematics, images, and hyperlinks.

\section{Mathematics}

Here is a mathematical formula: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, also known as the Pythagorean theorem.
We can also write equations in a more fancy way using the \textit{align} environment:

\begin{align*} % begins the align environment, * removes equation numbers
    \nabla \cdot \textbf{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\ % \nabla is the nabla symbol, \cdot is the dot symbol
    \nabla \cdot \textbf{B} &= 0 \\
    \nabla \times \textbf{E} &= - \frac{\partial \textbf{B}}{\partial t}
\end{align*}

Isn't that cool? We can also label and reference equations using the \textit{equation} environment:

\begin{equation} % begins the equation environment
    \label{eq:gauss} % labels the equation for referencing
    \oint_S \textbf{E} \cdot \textbf{dA} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0} % \oint is the integral symbol with a circle, \cdot is the dot symbol
\end{equation}

As you can see in Equation \ref{eq:gauss}, this is Gauss's law which relates electric flux to charge enclosed.

\section{Images}

We can also include images in our document.
Here is a photo of a dog:

\begin{figure}[h] % begins the figure environment and [h] specifies to place the figure "here"
    \centering % centers the figure
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{dog.jpg} % includes the image with a width of 6cm
    \caption{A cute dog} % adds a caption to the figure
    \label{fig:dog} % labels the figure for referencing
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:dog} shows a cute dog.
We can also refer to a specific part of an image using the \textit{subfigure} environment:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.3\textwidth} % creates a subfigure with 30% of the text width
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{cat.jpg} % includes the image with a width of the current subfigure
        \caption{A cute cat} % adds a caption to the subfigure
        \label{fig:cat} % labels the subfigure for referencing
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}{0.3\textwidth} % creates a subfigure with 30% of the text width
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{bird.jpg} % includes the image with a width of the current subfigure
        \caption{A beautiful bird} % adds a caption to the subfigure
        \label{fig:bird} % labels the subfigure for referencing
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Animals} % adds a caption to the overall figure
    \label{fig:animals} % labels the overall figure for referencing
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:cat} shows a cute cat and Figure \ref{fig:bird} shows a beautiful bird.
We can also reference the entire figure by referencing \ref{fig:animals}.

\section{Hyperlinks}

Lastly, we can add hyperlinks to external websites in our document.
For example, here is a link to the \textit{LaTeX Wikibook} website: \url{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}.
We can also add internal links such as referencing an equation or a figure.
For example, here is a link to Equation \ref{eq:gauss} and Figure \ref{fig:cat}.
