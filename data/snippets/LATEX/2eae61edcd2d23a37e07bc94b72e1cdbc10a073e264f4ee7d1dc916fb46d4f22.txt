Here we will learn how to include equations, graphics and hyperlinks in our   //continues the text in the section.
document.

\subsection{Equations}                                                       //creates a subsection titled Equations
Equations in \LaTeX{} can be easily included using the \$...\$ command.       //adds text to the Equations subsection.
For example, the famous Pythagorean theorem can be written as:               //continues the text in the subsection.
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$                                                         //inserts the equation using the $$...$$ command.
where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are the sides of a right triangle.                    //adds text to the subsection.

To include graphics in our document, we need to first import the             //adds text to the Graphics subsection.
\textit{graphicx} package.                                                   //uses the \textit{} command to italicize text.
Then, we can use the \textbackslash includegraphics command to insert the    //continues the text in the subsection.
desired image.                                                             
\begin{figure}[h]                                                           //creates a figure element with the "here" placement specifier
    \centering                                                               //centers the image
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image.jpg}                                   //inserts the image from the local folder
    \caption{My Image}                                                       //adds a caption to the image
    \label{fig:myimage}                                                      //assigns a label to the image for referencing within the document
\end{figure}                                                                  

As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:myimage}, including images in \LaTeX{} is   //uses the \ref{} command to reference the label on the image.
fairly simple and straightforward.                                          //adds text to the subsection.

\subsection{Hyperlinks}                                                      //creates a subsection titled Hyperlinks
Using the \textit{hyperref} package, we can easily include hyperlinks in     //adds text to the Hyperlinks subsection.
our document.                                                               //continues the text in the subsection.

For example, we can create a link to the \LaTeX{} official website like      //adds text to the subsection.
this: \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{\LaTeX{} Project}.              //inserts a hyperlink to the website with the displayed text "LaTeX Project".
\newline                                                                     //inserts a new line

\section{Conclusion}                                                         //creates a section titled Conclusion
In conclusion, \LaTeX{} is a powerful tool for creating professional         //adds text to the Conclusion section.
documents with equations, graphics, and hyperlinks.                          //continues the text in the section.
With just a little practice, anyone can learn to use it effectively.         //adds text to the section.
