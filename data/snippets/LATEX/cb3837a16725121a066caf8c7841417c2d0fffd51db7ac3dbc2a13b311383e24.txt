\maketitle %Generates the document title

\section{Introduction} %Starts a new section with title "Introduction"

This is a complex document with lots of mathematical equations and graphics. Let's start with a simple equation:
\begin{equation*} %Aligns equations without numbering
 f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} %Defines the equation as a fraction with the value of x squared in the denominator
\end{equation*}

Now let's add some text in between the equations:
\begin{gather*} %Allows for multiple equations in one environment
    f(x) + g(x) = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} \\ %Creates first equation with a plus sign
    = \frac{x+1}{x^2} %Creates second equation with addition of 1 to x in the numerator
\end{gather*}

\section{Methods} %Starts a new section with title "Methods"

Here we will discuss the methods used in our complex document.
\subsection{Data Collection} %Creates a new subsection under "Methods"

We collected data from various sources and used the following formula to analyze it:
\begin{equation*}
    y = mx + b %Defines the equation of a straight line
\end{equation*}
where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.

\subsection{Analysis} %Creates a new subsection under "Methods"

We used the data collected to create a graph using the following code:
\begin{verbatim} %Verbatim inserts non-executable text
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{graph.png} %Inserts and adjusts the scale of the image
\end{verbatim}

\section{Results} %Starts a new section with title "Results"

Our graph showed a clear correlation between the data collected and our analysis.

\subsection{Conclusion} %Creates a new subsection under "Results"

In conclusion, our complex document showcases the use of equations, graphics, and data analysis to reach a meaningful result.
