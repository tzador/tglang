\documentclass{article} % Defines the type of document, in this case an article

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % Specifies the input encoding of the document, in this case utf8

\title{Example Document} % Sets the title of the document
\author{John Doe} % Sets the author of the document
\date{\today} % Sets the date of the document, in this case the current date

\begin{document} % Begins the document

\maketitle % Inserts the title, author, and date into the document

\section{Introduction} % Begins a new section with the title "Introduction"
This is just an example document to demonstrate the basics of using \LaTeX.
% This is a comment in LaTeX, marked by the percent symbol

\subsection{Overview} % Begins a subsection with the title "Overview"
\LaTeX \ is a typesetting language used for creating high-quality documents.
% The "\ " command is used to add a space after the \LaTeX command

\subsection{Advantages} 
There are several advantages to using \LaTeX \ for document creation:
\begin{itemize} % Begins a list with bullet points
\item Professional appearance
\item Easy citation and referencing
\item Consistent formatting
\item Compatibility with scientific and mathematical notation
\end{itemize} % Ends the list

\section{Body}
The body of the document can include text, equations, tables, and figures.

\subsection{Equations}
Equations can be added using a variety of formats, such as inline:
$E = mc^2$, 
or as a separate block:
\[E = m c^2\]
% The "\[" and "\]" commands indicate the beginning and end of the equation environment

\subsection{Tables}
Tables can be created using the \textit{tabular} environment:
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} % Begins a table with two columns, each with centered text
\hline % Adds a horizontal line
Name & Age \\ % Specifies the column headers
\hline % Adds a horizontal line
John & 25 \\ % Specifies the first row of data
Jane & 30 \\ % Specifies the second row of data
\hline % Adds a horizontal line
\end{tabular} % Ends the table

\subsection{Figures}
Figures can be inserted using the \textit{figure} environment and the \textit{includegraphics} command:
\begin{figure}[ht] % Begins a figure with the placement specifier "ht" (here or top)
\centering % Centers the figure
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{example-image} % Inserts the image "example-image" with 50% of the line width
\caption{Example figure} % Adds a caption to the figure
\label{fig:example} % Adds a label to reference the figure later
\end{figure} % Ends the figure environment

\section{Conclusion}
This concludes the basic demonstration of \LaTeX \ and its capabilities.
