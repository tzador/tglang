    ( IF is a conditional word, it checks if the top stack item is true (non-zero). 
    If it is, it executes the code between IF and THEN. 
    In this case, it prints "The sum is" and then prints the top stack item, which is the sum. 
    If the top stack item is false (zero), it skips over the code between IF and THEN. 
    In this case, the sum is not printed.)

    ( This prints a thank you message and a newline character )
