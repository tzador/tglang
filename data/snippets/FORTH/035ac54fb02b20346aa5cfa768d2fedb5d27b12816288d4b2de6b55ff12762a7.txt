\ Constant representing the value of pi
: PI 3.14159 CONSTANT
 
\ Prompt user for radius
." Enter the radius of the circle: " CR
R>INPUT
 
\ Define a word (function) for calculating the area, takes in a radius as input
: AREA ( RADIUS )
    Rdup f* PI f* f> ;
    
\ Duplicate the radius and square it with 'f*', then multiply by PI and return the result
 
\ Prompt user for radius and push it onto the stack
." Enter the radius of the circle: " CR
R>INPUT
 
\ Execute the 'AREA' function with the radius as input
AREA
 
\ Display the calculated area to the user
." The area of the circle is: " .
 
\ End the program
