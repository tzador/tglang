\ This FORTH code snippet uses recursive functions to find the nth Fibonacci number

variable n              \ define variable n to store the input number
: fib ( n -- result)     \ create a new word called fib that takes an input n and outputs a result
    n  2 < if           \ if n is less than 2, then
        n               \ return n
    else                \ else, 
        n 1- fib       \ recursively call fib with n-1 and add it to the second recursive call with n-2
        n 2- fib +       \ add the results of the two recursive calls
    then
;                        \ end the fib word definition

5 fib .                   \ output the 5th Fibonacci number, which should be 3
