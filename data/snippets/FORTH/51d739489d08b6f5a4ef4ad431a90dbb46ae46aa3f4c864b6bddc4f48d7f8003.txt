\ This code snippet creates a word called "multiply" that takes two arguments and multiplies them together \

: multiply ( a b -- c ) \ create multiply word that takes two arguments a and b and outputs their product c \
   * \ multiply the top two values on the stack and push their product back onto the stack \
; \ end the definition of the multiply word \

\ Example usage: \
3 5 multiply \ push 3 and 5 onto the stack, call multiply word, which will output 15 onto the stack \
\ Alternatively: \
.s \ print the contents of the stack, which will show "15" \
