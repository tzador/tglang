\ This snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
: factorial ( n -- n! ) 0 swap ?do i 1+ over * loop drop ;
\ Explaination: Creates a new word called "factorial" that takes in a number and returns its factorial value. 
\ The word starts with 0 on the stack, swaps it with the given number, and then begins a do loop. 
\ The loop runs from 0 (inclusive) to the given number (exclusive), with i being the loop counter. 
\ On each iteration, i is incremented by 1 and then multiplied with the accumulator (initially set to 0). 
\ After the loop completes, the accumulator value is dropped, leaving only the factorial value on the stack.
