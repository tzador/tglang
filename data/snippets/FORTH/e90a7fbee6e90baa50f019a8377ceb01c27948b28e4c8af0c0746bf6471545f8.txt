\ This code snippet implements a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number. \

: factorial ( n -- n! )  \ Declare the factorial function, takes in a number and returns the factorial \
    dup 1 > if           \ Check if the number is greater than 1, if not, return 1 \
        dup 1 -          \ Duplicate the number and decrease it by 1 \
        factorial       \ Call the factorial function recursively \
        *               \ Multiply the factorial of the decreased number with the current number \
    else                  \ If the number is 1 or less, return 1 \
        drop 1           \ Drop the number from the stack and push 1 \
    then;                 \ End if statement and function declaration \
    
10 factorial             \ Call the factorial function with input 10 and print the result \
