( This code snippet takes in a number and checks if it is equal to 4, 
    if it is, it multiplies it by 3 and prints out the result, 
    if it is not, it subtracts 2 from it and prints out the result. )

: check ( n -- )
    dup 4 = ( check if number is equal to 4 )
    if ( if equal to 4, multiply by 3 )
        3 * . ( print result )
    else ( if not equal to 4, subtract 2 )
        2 - . ( print result )
    then ; ( end of if statement )
    
( To use this code snippet, simply input a number and call the check word, like so: )

3 check ( outputs 1 )
5 check ( outputs 3 )
12 check ( outputs 36 )
