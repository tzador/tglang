: COMPLEX-CALC ( a b c -- result ) \ This is a complex calculation that takes three inputs and returns the result

   DUP 5 * \ Duplicate first input and multiply by 5
   SWAP \ Swap top two inputs
   3 / \ Divide second input by 3
   ROT \ Rotate the inputs to swap the positions of the top two
   4 + \ Add 4 to third input
   ROT \ Rotate again to get the inputs in their original positions
   2 * \ Multiply first input by 2
   OVER \ Duplicate the second input
   1 + \ Add 1 to the second input
   - \ Subtract second input from first input
   SWAP \ Swap top two inputs again
   2 * \ Multiply third input by 2
   3 * \ Multiply result of previous calculations by 3
   2 - \ Subtract 2 from the result
   DUP \ Duplicate the result
   ROT \ Rotate the inputs to swap the positions of the top two
   3 / \ Divide second input by 3
   1 - \ Subtract 1 from second input
   SWAP \ Swap top two inputs again
   OVER \ Duplicate the third input
   ROT \ Rotate the inputs to swap the positions of the top two
   / \ Divide third input by second input
   * \ Multiply result of previous calculations by first input
   SWAP \ Swap top two inputs again
   2 + \ Add 2 to the result
   SWAP \ Swap top two inputs again
   2 / \ Divide result by 2
   SWAP \ Swap top two inputs again
   5 - \ Subtract 5 from the result
   4 + \ Add 4 to the result
   SWAP \ Swap top two inputs again
   2 / \ Divide result by 2
   . \ Output the final result
