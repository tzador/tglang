\ Example code demonstrating recursion in FORTH
: factorial ( n -- n! ) 
    dup 1 <= not ( checks if n is less than or equal to 1 )
    if (if not, call factorial recursively) 
        dup 1- factorial swap * (decrement n, recursively call factorial, multiply result)
    else (if n is <= 1, return 1)
        drop 1 (discard n, push 1)
    then ; (end if)
    
20 factorial . (prints 2432902008176640000)
