: CHARACTER HEX ( n -- c )        \ Defines a new word named CHARACTER, which takes a hex value and outputs the corresponding character
HEX BASE @ >                       \ Puts the current base in the data stack, then sets the base to hex
SWAP                              \ Swaps the top two values in the data stack
ROT                               \ Moves the third value to the top of the data stack, ensuring the hex value is at the top
6 SWAP DO                          \ Starts a loop which executes the following code 6 times
I *                               \ Multiplies the loop index by itself and puts the result on the data stack
DUP                               \ Duplicates the top value in the data stack
5 -                               \ Subtracts 5 from the duplicated value, effectively calculating (I*I)-5
+                                 \ Adds the result to the hex value at the top of the data stack
LOOP                              \ Ends the loop
BASE !                            \ Restores the base to its previous value
;                                 \ Ends the definition of the new word
