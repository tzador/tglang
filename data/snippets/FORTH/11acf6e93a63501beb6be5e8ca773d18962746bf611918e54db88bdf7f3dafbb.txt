: EXAMPLE ( n1 n2 n3 -- n1 n3 ) \ This is a word called EXAMPLE that takes in three numbers and outputs the first and third numbers
  dup 2 = ( n1 n2 n3 -- n1 n1 n3 ) \ Duplicates the second number and checks if it is equal to 2, if yes then performs the next command
  if ( n1 n2 n3 -- n1 n3 ) \ Executes next command if the statement before is true
    0
  else ( n1 n2 n3 -- n1 n2 n3 ) \ Executes next command if the statement before is false
    1
  then ( n1 n2 n3 -- n1 index ) \ Ends the if statement and returns either 0 or 1 depending on the above commands
  2 / ( n1 n2 n3 -- n1 index ) \ Divides the index by 2
  * ( n1 n2 n3 -- n1 n3 ) \ Multiplies the first and third number
  swap ( n1 n2 n3 -- n3 n2 n1 ) \ Reverses the order of the top two items on the stack (n3 and n1)
; \ Ends the word definition
