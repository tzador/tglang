\ A sample FORTH code snippet \

\ Define a word to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle \
: hypotenuse ( a b -- c ) \ takes two inputs a and b, returns c \
  dup * swap dup * + sqrt \ c^2 = a^2 + b^2, calculate c by taking square root \
;

\ Define a word to calculate the area of a circle \
: area ( r -- a ) \ takes radius r, returns area a \
  2dup *  \ raise r to the second power \
  3.14159265358979 * \ multiply by pi (approximated) \
; \ end of definition \

\ Example usage: \
5 3 hypotenuse . \ output: 5.83102 \ (calculated c for a = 5 and b = 3) \
12 area . \ output: 452.389 \ (calculated area for a circle with radius = 12)
