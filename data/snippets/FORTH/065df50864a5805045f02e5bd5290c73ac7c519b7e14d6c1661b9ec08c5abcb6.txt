\ Recursive factorial function in FORTH

: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! ) \ Create a new definition called FACTORIAL which takes in input n and outputs n!
    DUP 0 = IF \ If n is 0, then stop recursion by duplicating n and checking if it is equal to 0
        DROP 1 \ If n is 0, then drop it and replace it with 1, which is the base case
    ELSE \ Continue recursion
        DUP 1- \ Duplicate n and subtract 1, decrementing n
        FACTORIAL \ Call the FACTORIAL word recursively
        * \ Multiply the current n with the previous result from recursive call
    THEN \ End if statement
; \ End definition

6 FACTORIAL \ Call the FACTORIAL definition with input 6 and output 720 (6!)
