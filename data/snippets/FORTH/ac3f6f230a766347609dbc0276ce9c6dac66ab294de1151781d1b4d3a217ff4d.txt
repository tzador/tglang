: DECIMAL-TO-OCTAL ( n -- n')
  \ Takes in decimal number and converts it to octal

  BASE @ 10 BASE ! \ saves old BASE, sets to 10 for conversion
  8 BASE ! \ set BASE to 8 for octal conversion
  I/O-BASE @ 10 I/O-BASE ! \ saves old I/O-BASE, sets to 10 for output
 
  SWAP \ swap top 2 items on stack
  \ loop to convert to octal
  BEGIN
    OVER DUP MOD \ duplicate and get remainder
    SWAP BASE / \ divide by base
    3 U.R \ print remainder using unsigned 3-digit field
    DUP 0< \ check if quotient is less than 0
  UNTIL
  DROP \ drop top of stack (final quotient)

  I/O-BASE @ I/O-BASE ! \ restore I/O-BASE to previous value
  BASE ! \ restore BASE to previous value
