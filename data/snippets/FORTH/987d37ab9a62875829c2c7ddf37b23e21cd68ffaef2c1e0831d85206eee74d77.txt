\ This is a sample FORTH code snippet that implements a simple calculator
\ It takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
\ The result is printed out to the console

: add ( num1 num2 -- sum ) \ Define the add function
  + \ Add the two input numbers
; \ End of the add function 

: sub ( num1 num2 -- difference ) \ Define the sub function
  - \ Subtract the second number from the first number
; \ End of the sub function

: mul ( num1 num2 -- product ) \ Define the mul function
  * \ Multiply the two input numbers
; \ End of the mul function

: div ( num1 num2 -- quotient ) \ Define the div function
  / \ Divide the first number by the second number
; \ End of the div function

\ Input two numbers
10 5 \ 10 is stored on the stack first, followed by 5

\ Perform addition
add \ Call the add function, which adds the two numbers on the stack and stores the result on the stack

\ Print the result
. \ Dot operator prints the top value on the stack to the console

\ Perform subtraction
sub

\ Print the result
. 

\ Perform multiplication
mul

\ Print the result
. 

\ Perform division
div

\ Print the result
. 

\ Output:
15 \ Result of addition
5 \ Result of subtraction
50 \ Result of multiplication
2 \ Result of division
