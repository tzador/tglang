: MAX ( n1 n2 -- n3 )   \ Defines a word MAX that takes two numbers and returns the maximum of the two
  DUP OVER < IF         \ Duplicates both inputs, then takes the first one and compares it to the second
    SWAP                \ If the first is smaller, swaps the top two values
  THEN                  \ Ends the IF statement
  DROP ;                \ Drops the smaller of the two inputs, leaving the larger as the only value on the stack
: FACT ( n -- n! )      \ Defines a word FACT that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
  DUP 1 = IF            \ Duplicates input and checks if it is equal to 1
    DROP 1              \ If so, drops the duplicate and returns 1
  ELSE                  \ If not, enters the ELSE statement 
    DUP 1 -             \ Duplicates input and subtracts 1 from it
    FACT                \ Recursively calls FACT on the new input
    *                   \ Multiplies the result of the recursion with the original input
  THEN                  \ Ends the IF statement
;
5 MAX 10 MAX            \ Calls the MAX word twice to find the maximum of 5 and 10
2 FACT                  \ Calls the FACT word to find the factorial of 2
