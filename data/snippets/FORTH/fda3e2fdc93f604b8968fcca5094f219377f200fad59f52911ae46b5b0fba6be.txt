\ We will create a FORTH word that performs mathematical operations
: MATH ( n1 n2 operation -- n3 ) \ Define FORTH word that takes two numbers and an operation as input and returns the result
    CASE
        1 OF + ENDOF \ Adds the two numbers together
        2 OF - ENDOF \ Subtracts the second number from the first
        3 OF * ENDOF \ Multiplies the two numbers
        4 OF / ENDOF \ Divides the first number by the second
    ENDCASE
; \ End of word definition
