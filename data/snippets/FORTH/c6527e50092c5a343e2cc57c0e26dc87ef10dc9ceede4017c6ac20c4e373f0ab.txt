\ A word that takes in two integers and returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the two numbers
: GCD ( n1 n2 -- n3 )
  BEGIN
    OVER MOD              \ n1 n2 % of the two numbers 
    SWAP OVER             \ n2 n1 % n1 
    WHILE
      TUCK                \ insert n2 below n1 
      SWAP                \ swap n1 and n2 
      MOD                 \ get the remainder n1%n2 
    REPEAT                \ loop until remainder = 0 
    DROP                  \ drop the last remainder 
  ;
  
\ Example usage:
6 9 GCD . \ outputs 3
12 18 GCD . \ outputs 6
