\ A simple program that calculates the area of a circle
\ Define the radius of the circle
10 constant r
\ Define the constant Pi
3.14 constant Pi
\ Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: A = πr²
\ Store the result in the variable 'area'
r 2 * Pi * fconstant A
\ Display the result on the screen
." The area of the circle is " A .
