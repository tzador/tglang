: NIP ( a b -- b ) \ Removes the element before the top of the stack
  1- \ Move the second element down by 1 position
  \ Example:
  \ 1 2 3 NIP \ will result in the stack being: 1 3
  2 2 = IF \ Checks if the second element and third element are equal
    1 + \ If they are equal, increments the second element by 1
    \ Example:
    \ 2 2 NIP \ will result in the stack being: 1 3
