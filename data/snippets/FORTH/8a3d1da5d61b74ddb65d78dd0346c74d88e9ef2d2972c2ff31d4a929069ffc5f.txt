Variable counter \ creates a variable named counter
Variable threshold \ creates a variable named threshold

0 threshold ! \ initialize threshold to 0

5 add \ adds 5 to the counter, outputs "Value added to counter"
5 add \ adds 5 to the counter, outputs "Value added to counter"
2 add \ adds 2 to the counter, outputs "Value added to counter"
10 add \ adds 10 to the counter, outputs "Value added to counter"
reset \ resets the counter to 0
20 add \ adds 20 to the counter, outputs "Threshold reached"
reset \ resets the counter to 0
set-threshold \ sets the threshold to 15, outputs "New threshold set"
10 add \ adds 10 to the counter, outputs "Value added to counter"
15 add \ adds 15 to the counter, outputs "Threshold reached"
