: MULT1988 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O ; \\Defines a new word called MULT1988 that expects 15 inputs
4 0 DO OVER I A + SWAP J B + C + DUP * \\For each of the 15 inputs, we add them to the current value in the stack and multiply it by the top value
SWAP (B + C + A * (I) )
SWAP (A * I + F * (I) ) -M*G-(D) N+ D*H+ M*G |N * (J) O+ ; \\More operations using the inputs and the stack
LOOP ; \\Loop back to the start until all inputs are processed
MULT1988 \\Call the new word with the given inputs (A, B, C, etc.)
