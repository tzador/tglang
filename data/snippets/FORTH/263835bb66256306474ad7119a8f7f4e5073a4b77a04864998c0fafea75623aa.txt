In this code snippet, we first create a new word called "FLAT" using the "CREATE" keyword.
The "FLAT" word expects two inputs, a size and an address, which are denoted by the words "size" and "addr" respectively.
We then move to the "HERE" address using the "@HERE" keyword, which points to the current compilation address in memory.
Next, we define a constant "IN" with the value of the current compilation address using the "CONSTANT" keyword.
The next line starts with a closing parenthesis, which signifies the start of the defining word for "FLAT".
Inside the definition, we first swap the size and address inputs, then use a loop to iterate the value of the size and add it to the address using the "+!" keyword.
Finally, we use the "DOES>" keyword to specify the action to be taken when the "FLAT" word is executed, which in this case is to drop the unnecessary input and execute the defined loop.
The semicolon at the end indicates the end of the word definition.
