\ This snippet calculates the factorial of a given number

: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! ) \ Define a new word
    1 SWAP \ Initialize product to 1 and swap with input
    BEGIN \ Begin loop
        DUP 1 = UNTIL \ Duplicate and check if equal to 1, exit loop if so
        DUP SWAP * SWAP 1- \ Duplicate, multiply with product, swap, decrement
    AGAIN \ End loop and return product
;

15 FACTORIAL . \ Output factorial of 15, should be 1307674368000
