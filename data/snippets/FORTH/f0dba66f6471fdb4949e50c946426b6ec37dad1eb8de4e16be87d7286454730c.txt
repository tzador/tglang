; \ This snippet defines the FIND function in FORTH, which takes in an address and looks for a specific character (in this case, ASCII #32, or space). If the character is found, it returns the address of the match. If not found, it returns 0. The code uses various stack operations and comparison statements to achieve this functionality.
