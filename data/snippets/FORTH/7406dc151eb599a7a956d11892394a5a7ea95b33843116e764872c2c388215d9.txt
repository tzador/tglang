(This code snippet calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.)

100 2 / 0 1 DO          (loops through all numbers between 1 and 100 
                          by increments of 2, starting at 0)
    DUP EVEN 0=         (duplicates number and checks if it is even)
    IF                  (if it is even)
        OVER +          (adds number to previous sum)
    THEN                (end if)
    2 + LOOP           (increments loop counter by 2)
    CR                 (moves to next line)
100 MOD                  (takes modulus of 100 and number of completed loops)
0=                      (checks if modulus is 0)
IF                      (if it is 0, all numbers have been looped through)
    .S                  (prints current stack, which will have the sum of even numbers at the top)
THEN                    (end if)
