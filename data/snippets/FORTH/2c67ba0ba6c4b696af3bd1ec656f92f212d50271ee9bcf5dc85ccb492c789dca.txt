: TRIANGLE \ Create a word that draws a triangle
    \ Three arguments are needed to specify the triangle's coordinates
    ( x1 ) ( y1 ) ( x2 ) ( y2 ) ( x3 ) ( y3 ) 
    \ First, move to the first vertex
    x1 y1 MOVETO
    \ Draw a line from the first to second vertex
    x2 y2 LINETO
    \ Draw a line from the second to third vertex
    x3 y3 LINETO
    \ Draw a line from the third back to the first vertex, completing the triangle
    x1 y1 LINETO
    \ Close the path
    CLOSEPATH
    \ Fill the triangle with black color
    0 0 0 SETRGB
    \ Draw the triangle on the canvas
    FILL
    ; \ End of the word definition
    
    \ Example usage:
    50 50 100 150 200 50 TRIANGLE \ Draws a triangle with vertices at (50, 50), (100, 150), (200, 50)
