: **Find-Prime** \ definition of Find-Prime function
cr \ clear the screen
." Enter a number: " \ print text telling user to input a number
#s \ read user input as a string
s>d \ converts string to double integer
2 swap - \ subtract 2 from input
0 swap ?DO \ iterate through numbers starting from 0 until input - 2
    I 1+ \ keep track of current number and add 1
    3 1 DO \ iterate 3 times for checking divisibility by 3
        dup I rem 0= IF \ if remainder of input divided by current number is 0
            ." Not a prime number" \ print message to user
            UNLOOP \ stop iterating through numbers and loop back to previous DO loop
        THEN \ end IF statement
    LOOP \ end inner DO loop
LOOP \ end outer DO loop
dup abs 1 = IF \ if absolute value of input is 1
    drop ." Not a prime number" \ drop input and print message to user
ELSE \ else statement for other cases
    DROP ." Is a prime number" \ drop input and print message to user
THEN \ end IF statement
