: SQUARE ( n -- n^2 ) \ Define a word to calculate the square of a number
  DUP * ; \ Duplicate input and multiply it by itself, leaving the result on the stack
  
: POWER ( x n -- x^n ) \ Define a word to calculate the power of a number
  1 SWAP \ Put a 1 on the stack and swap it with the input number
  BEGIN \ Start a loop
    DUP WHILE \ Duplicate the number and check if its nonzero
    ROT OVER * \ Rotate the top three items on the stack and multiply them
    SWAP 1 - REPEAT \ Swap and decrement the exponent, and loop until it reaches 0
  DROP ; \ Drop the remaining number on the stack
