: ROT2 ( a b c -- c a b )
  OVER SWAP SWAP ; ( Takes the top three stack items and places them in reverse order )

: DO-UNTIL ( n "do-block" -- )
  BEGIN DUP WHILE
  SWAP POP ( Swap condition with top item and discard top of stack (to avoid duplication) )
; REPEAT ; ( Execute "do-block" until condition is false, discarding condition before repeating )

( This code snippet defines two functions: ROT2 and DO-UNTIL.
  ROT2 takes the top three stack items and places them in reverse order, while DO-UNTIL executes
  a "do-block" until the condition on top of the stack is false. Both functions make use of some
  useful FORTH stack manipulation words, such as OVER, SWAP, DUP, and POP. )
