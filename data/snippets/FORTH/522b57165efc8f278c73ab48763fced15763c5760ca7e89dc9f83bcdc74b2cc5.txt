: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! ) 1 SWAP BEGIN DUP WHILE DUP 1 - SWAP * REPEAT ; \ This code defines a factorial function in FORTH, which calculates the factorial of a given number. 
  \ The function takes in one parameter, 'n', and returns the factorial of 'n'.
  \ It first assigns the value of '1' to the top of the stack, then swaps it with the given number 'n'. 
  \ It starts a BEGIN loop, which continues executing code while the top of the stack is non-zero. 
  \ Inside the loop, it keeps making a duplicate of the top of the stack (using DUP) and subtracts '1' from it. 
  \ Then it swaps the top two elements and multiplies them, effectively decreasing the number by '1' and multiplying it with the previous value. 
  \ This continues until the top of the stack becomes '0', at which point the loop ends and the final value is returned as the factorial of 'n'.
