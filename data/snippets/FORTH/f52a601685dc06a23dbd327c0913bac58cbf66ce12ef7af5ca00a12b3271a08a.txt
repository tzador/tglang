\ This code snippet uses FORTH syntax to define a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

: factorial ( n -- n! ) \ Define the function with input and output on the stack

dup 1 = IF 1 EXIT THEN \ Check if input is 1, exit with 1 if true

dup 1 - factorial * ; \ Otherwise, recursively call factorial with input-1 and multiply the result with the input

10 factorial . \ Run the function with input 10 and print the result
