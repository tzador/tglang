: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! ) 1 SWAP BEGIN DUP 1 > WHILE SWAP DUP ROT * SWAP 1- SWAP REPEAT DROP ; //Defines a new word called 'FACTORIAL' which takes a number 'n' and returns its factorial 'n!'. It begins by pushing a 1 onto the stack and then SWAPPING the top two items. It then enters a BEGIN loop which duplicates the top item, checks if it's greater than 1, and repeats until that is no longer true. At each iteration, it SWAPS the top two items, duplicates the top item, ROTates the top three items (moving the last item to the top), multiplies the top two items, SWAPS the top two items, subtracts 1 from the top item, and then SWAPS the top two items once again. Once the loop exits, it removes the extra top item on the stack before returning the factorial.
