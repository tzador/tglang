\ This code snippet demonstrates a recursive factorial function in FORTH

: factorial ( n -- n! )
  dup 1 = ( check if n equals 1 )
  if ( if condition is true )
    drop ( pop the duplicate value from the stack )
    1 ( push 1 to the stack to start recursion )
  else ( if condition is false )
    dup 1 - ( duplicate n, subtract 1 from duplicate, and push to stack )
    recurse * ( call the factorial function recursively and multiply with current n )
  then
; ( end the conditional )

10 factorial . ( print the factorial of 10 on the console)
