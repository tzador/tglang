: TRIPLE ( n -- n n n ) \ A word that triples the input
   3 * ;        \ Multiply the input by 3 and leave it on the stack

: DOUBLE ( n -- n n ) \ A word that doubles the input
   2 * ;        \ Multiply the input by 2 and leave it on the stack

: POWER ( x n -- result ) \ A word that computes the power of the given number
   1 swap 2 ?do       \ Set initial value of result to 1, swap x and n on stack, start loop
      dup POWER       \ Duplicate x and call POWER recursively, returning x^n and leaving x on the stack
      rot DOUBLE      \ Rotate stack so result and x are on top, double result and leave it on the stack
   loop              \ Continue looping until n-1 times have been performed
   nip ;             \ Remove the extra x from the stack and leave the final result

3 5 POWER .          \ Should output 243 (3^5)
