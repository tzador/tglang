: FACTORIAL ( n -- f ) dup 0 > if // `: FACTORIAL`: a word that takes an input `n` and calculates its factorial, using the `dup` word to duplicate the input on the stack
    dup 1 - recursive-factorial * // `dup 0 > if`: checks if the input is greater than 0, if so, continues with the code block
else // `dup 1 - recursive-factorial`: uses dup to duplicate the input on the stack, then subtracts 1 and recursively calls the `FACTORIAL` word again
    drop 1 // `*`: multiplies the duplicate input with the result of the recursive call and leaves the final result on the stack
then ; // `drop 1`: drops the duplicate input from the stack, leaving only the final result on the stack
 9 FACTORIAL // `then ;`: ends the `if` statement and the `FACTORIAL` word definition, ready to be used
