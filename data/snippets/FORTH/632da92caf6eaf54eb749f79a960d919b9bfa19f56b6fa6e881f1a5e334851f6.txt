\ Stack Manipulation Words

\ Define a variable for the stack depth
variable depth

\ Define a word that checks the stack depth
: check-depth depth @ \ get current depth
depth !            \ store it for later

\ Define a word that checks if the stack is empty
: empty? depth @ 0 = ;

\ Define a word that checks if the stack is not empty
: not-empty? depth @ 0 > ;

\ Define a word that clears the stack
: clear-stack
    begin empty? while drop repeat ;

\ Define a word that swaps the top two items on the stack
: tuck
    \ get first item
    depth @ -1  +   2 /mod \ div by two, remainder = divisor, quotient = first item
  swap
    \ get second item
    depth @ -1 0+   2 /mod \ div by two, remainder = divisor, quotient = second item
  swap
  rot
    \ put first item after second item
  ;

\ Define a word that rotates the top three items on the stack
: over
    \ get first item
    depth @ -2  +   3 /mod \ div by three, remainder = divisor, quotient = first item
  swap
    \ get second item
    depth @ -2 0+   3 /mod \ div by three, remainder = divisor, quotient = second item
  swap
    \ get third item
    depth @ -2 0+   3 /mod \ div by three, remainder = divisor, quotient = third item
  2swap
    \ put first item after third item
