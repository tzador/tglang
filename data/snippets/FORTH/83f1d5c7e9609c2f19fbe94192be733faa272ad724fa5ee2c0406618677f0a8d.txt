: IS-PRIME? \ Defines a word that checks if a number is prime
    DUP 2 < IF \ Duplicates the number and compares it with 2, if it is less than 2
        DROP #F \ Removes the duplicate and pushes #F (false) onto the stack
        EXIT \ Exits the word
    ENDIF \ Ends the if statement
    DUP 2 > IF \ Duplicates the number and compares it with 2, if it is greater than 2
        2 SWAP DO DUP I MOD 0= IF \ Starts a DO loop, duplicates the number and checks if the current loop value (I) evenly divides it
            DROP #F \ If it does, drops the duplicate and pushes #F (false) onto the stack
            EXIT \ Exits the word
        ENDIF \ Ends the if statement
    LOOP \ Ends the DO loop
    #T \ If the word reaches this point, it pushes #T (true) onto the stack, indicating that the number is prime
