\ Finding the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100

: sumOfEvens \ defining a word to calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100
0 \ initialize the sum variable
1 \ initialize the starting number
100 \ initialize the ending number

do \ start of loop
  dup \ duplicate the current number for checking even-ness
  2 mod 0 = \ check if the number is even
  if \ if it is even, add it to the sum
    dup \ duplicate the current number for adding to the sum
    over \ duplicate the current sum
    + \ add the number to the sum
    swap \ swap the sum and the current number
  then \ end of if statement
  1 + \ increment the current number
loop \ end of loop

. \ print the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100
