\ This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number using recursion and displays the result
: factorial ( n -- n! )
    dup 0 = if                     \ if n equals 0, return 1
        1 swap drop exit
    else
        dup 1 - factorial           \ calculate factorial of n-1
        * swap drop exit            \ multiply n with factorial of n-1 and return result
    then;

5 factorial .                       \ displays the factorial of 5, which is 120
