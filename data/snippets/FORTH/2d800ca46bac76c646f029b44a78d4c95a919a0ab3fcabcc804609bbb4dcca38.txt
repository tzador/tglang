( This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number in FORTH )

: factorial ( n -- n! ) ( create a word called factorial with input n and output n! )
    dup 0 = ( check if n is equal to 0 )
    if ( if statement for n = 0 )
        drop 1 ( if n = 0, return 1 for n! )
    else ( else statement for n != 0 )
        dup 1 = ( check if n = 1 )
        if ( if statement for n = 1 )
            drop 1 ( if n = 1, return 1 for n! )
        else ( else statement for n != 1 )
            1 - factorial ( subtract 1 from n and recursively call factorial )
            * ( multiply result of recursive call with current n value )
        then ( end statement for n = 1 if statement )
    then ( end statement for n = 0 if statement )
;

5 factorial ( calculate factorial of input number 5 )
. ( output result of factorial )
