\ A program in FORTH that calculates the factorial of a number
: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! ) \ defining a new word "FACTORIAL" that takes an input "n" and returns the factorial of that number
  dup 1 <= if \ duplicate the input, check if it is less than or equal to 1
    drop 1 \ if it is, drop the input and return 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1
  else \ if the input is greater than 1
    dup 1 - factorial swap * \ duplicate the input, subtract 1 from it, and recursively call the "FACTORIAL" word, then multiply the result with the current input
  then \ end if statement
; \ end of defining new word

\ Example usage: 6 FACTORIAL ( returns 720 )
