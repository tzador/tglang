\ A simple program in FORTH to display the first 20 prime numbers
20 CONSTANT N \ Sets the maximum number of primes to display
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 CONSTANT BRUTE \ Sets the maximum number to check for primality
: PRIME? \ Creates a function to check if a number is prime
  0 SWAP \ Move the number being checked to the top of the stack
  BEGIN \ Begin a loop
    DUP \ Duplicate the number
    DUP 2 > IF 1 SWAP 1 BEGIN OVER * ROT > ROLL 1 - UNTIL 2 * LOOP DROP THEN \ Checks if the number is divisible by 2 or odd numbers
    IF EXIT THEN \ If the number is not prime, exit the loop
    DUP . CR \ Display the prime number
    1 + \ Increment the number being checked
  BRUTE < WHILE REPEAT \ Repeat until the maximum number is reached
; \ End of function definition
0 \ Initial counter for number of primes found
BEGIN \ Begin a loop
  DUP PRIME? \ Check if the number is prime
  IF 1 + \ If it is, increment the counter
  ELSE DROP \ If not, drop the number from the stack
  THEN
  N = \ Check if the maximum number of primes has been reached
  IF EXIT THEN \ If it has, exit the loop
  1 + \ Increment the number being checked
REPEAT \ Repeat until the maximum number of primes is found
