: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! ) \This is a colon definition that creates the word 'FACTORIAL' which takes in a number n and returns its factorial n!.
   1 SWAP \Swap the top two elements which puts 1 on top of the stack.
   BEGIN DUP WHILE \Start a loop that duplicates the top element on the stack and checks if it is not equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
     OVER * \Multiply the top two elements on the stack which is the duplicated element and the value of the factorial so far.
     1 - \Decrement the value on the stack by 1.
     SWAP \Swap the top two elements which puts the modified value on top.
   REPEAT ; \Close the loop and the colon definition.
