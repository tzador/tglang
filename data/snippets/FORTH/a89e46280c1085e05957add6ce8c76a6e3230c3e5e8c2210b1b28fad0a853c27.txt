\ This is a Forth code snippet that will take in a list of numbers and sort them in ascending order
variable stack \ create a variable to store the stack
: ignore \ define a word to ignore the following word
    2drop ;
: swap \ define a word to swap the top two items on the stack
    over >r rot r> ;
: >r \ define a word to move the top item on the stack into the return stack
    >r swap ;
: r> \ define a word to move the top item on the return stack to the stack
    r> ;
: 2>r \ define a word to move the top two items on the stack into the return stack
    2>r >r ;
: 2r> \ define a word to move the top two items on the return stack to the stack
    r> r> ;
: sort \ define a word to sort the numbers in ascending order
    dup length 2/ \ get the length of the list and divide it by 2
    0 do \ loop through the list
        dup i pick >r \ get the current item and move it to the return stack
        i 1 + swap pick >r \ get the next item and move it to the return stack
        r@ swap > if \ compare the two items
            r> r@ swap \ swap them if they are not in ascending order
        then
        r> r> \ move the items back to the stack
    loop ;
: print-stack \ define a word to print the items on the stack
    dup if \ check if there are any items on the stack
        dup i pick . \ print the top item on the stack
        i 1 + swap pick print-stack \ recursively call the word to print the remaining items
    else
        drop \ if the stack is empty, drop the remaining 0 on the stack
    then ;
: input \ define a word to take in user input and store it in the stack
    cr ." How many numbers do you want to sort?" \ prompt the user for input
    accept \ wait for user input
    #s \ convert the input to a number
    0 do \ loop through the input
        #s swap stack ! \ store the number in the stack
    loop ;
input \ call the input word to take in the numbers
print-stack \ call the print-stack word to print the unsorted numbers
stack sort \ call the sort word to sort the numbers in ascending order
cr ." Sorted numbers:" print-stack \ print the sorted numbers
