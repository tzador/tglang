\ A simple program that checks if a number is prime

: prime?                \ Define a new word called "prime?"
   0 do                 \ Start a counter at 0 and loop through
      dup i mod 0 =     \ Duplicate the number and check if i mod number is equal to 0
      if                \ If so, the number is not prime, break the loop
         drop           \ Drop the duplicate number from the stack
         false exit    \ Exit the loop with false result
      then              \ End if statement
   loop                 \ End loop
   drop                 \ Drop the duplicate number from the stack (if it wasn't prime)
   true ;               \ If the number wasn't divisible by any numbers, it is prime

: factor               \ Define a new word called "factor"
   dup prime?          \ Duplicate the number and check if it is prime
   if                  \ If the number is prime, print "Prime"
      ." Prime " .     \ Prints "Prime" to the output
   else                \ Otherwise
      ." Composite " . \ Print "Composite" to the output
   then ;              \ End if statement

." Enter a number: "    \ Prints "Enter a number: "
query factor           \ Query user for a number and check if it is prime using "factor" word
drop                    \ Drop the input number from the stack
bye                     \ End program
