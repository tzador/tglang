: palindrom ( str -- bool ) 	\ Define a word that checks if a string is a palindrome
  dup length /mod 	 		\ Duplicate the input string, divide the string length by 2 and 
  							\ store the remainder on the stack
  swap 						\ Swap the remainder with the other half of the string
  rot swap 					\ Rotate the remainder down, swap it with the other half, and 
  							\ then swap the remainder back in place
  dup 2 + 					\ Duplicate the remainder, add 2 to it, and store it on the stack
  / reverse 				    \ Divide the string length by the incremented remainder, 
  							\ and reverse the string
  swap 						\ Swap the reversed string with the remainder
  nip * 						\ Remove the topmost element, leaving the reversed string on the stack
  swap - abs 					\ Swap the length of the original string with the length of the
  							\ reversed string, subtract them, and take the absolute value
  0 = 							\ Check if the difference is equal to 0, returning true if it is
  ;		 					\ End the definition of the palindrom word
