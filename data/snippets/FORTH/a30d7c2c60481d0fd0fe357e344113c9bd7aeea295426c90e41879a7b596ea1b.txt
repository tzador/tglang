\ This code snippet creates a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

: factorial ( n -- n! ) 
    dup 0 = IF             \ Check if input is equal to 0
        pop 1              \ Return 1 if input is 0
    ELSE 
        dup 1 -            \ Reduce input by 1 for recursive call
        factorial         \ Recursive call
        swap *            \ Multiply result of recursive call with current input
    THEN ;

5 factorial . \ Output: 120
