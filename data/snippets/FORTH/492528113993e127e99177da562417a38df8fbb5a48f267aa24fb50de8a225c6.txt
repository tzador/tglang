  \ This code snippet creates a word (function) named ROTATE which takes in three numbers as input
  \ The first line of code uses the FORTH word ROT to rotate the top three items on the stack
  \ The second line uses SWAP to swap the top two items, placing the second item on the top of the stack
  \ The third line uses DUP to duplicate the top item on the stack
  \ The fourth line uses OVER to duplicate the second item on the stack and place it on top
  \ The fifth line uses SWAP to swap the top two items again, placing the first item on top
  \ Next, - (minus) is used to subtract the second item from the first item
  \ The result is then added to the third item using the + (plus) word
  \ Another SWAP is used to place the result on top of the stack
  \ Lastly, the word ROTATE is commented with \ and ; to end the word definition
