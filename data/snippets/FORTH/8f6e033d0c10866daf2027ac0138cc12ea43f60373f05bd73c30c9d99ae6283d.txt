\ This code snippet implements a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number
: factorial ( n -- n! ) 
  dup 0 = if              \ check if n is 0
    drop 1                 \ if so, return 1 as the result
  else  
    dup 1 = if              \ check if n is 1
      drop 1                 \ if so, return 1 as the result
    else                    
      dup 1 - factorial *   \ otherwise, calculate n-1! and multiply with n
    then
  then ;
