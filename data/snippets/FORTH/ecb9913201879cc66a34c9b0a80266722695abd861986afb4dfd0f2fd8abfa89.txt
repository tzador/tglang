\ This is a program that calculates the area of a circle
variable pi constant 3.14 \ Set the value of pi

: area ( r -- a ) \ Define a word called "area"
    pi * ( r * r ) \ Multiply pi with the radius squared
;

\ The following code will prompt the user for the radius and output the area
." Enter the radius: " \ Print a message to prompt the user
input radius \ Receive input from the user and store it in the variable "radius"
radius area . \ Call the "area" word and print the result

bye \ End the program
