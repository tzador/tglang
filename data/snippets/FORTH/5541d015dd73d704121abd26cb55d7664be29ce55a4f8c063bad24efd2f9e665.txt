: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! ) \ This word takes in a number and computes its factorial
    
    DUP 1 = IF DROP 1 EXIT THEN \ Checks if input is 1, if so, drops number and exits (1! = 1)
    
    SWAP DUP 2 - FACTORIAL SWAP * \ Swaps top two numbers, duplicates input, subtracts 2 from duplicate
    \ then runs the word recursively to get factorial of n - 1, then multiplies by n
    
    ; \ End of word
