\ This code snippet demonstrates the use of a recursive function in FORTH, which prints out the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence 

    : FIB ( n -- ) 
        dup 0 > (check if n is greater than 0, if not, terminate function)
        if 
            dup 1 > (check if n is greater than 1, if not, print 0 and terminate function)
            if 
                1- (decrement n by 1) 
                dup 2 - (decrement n by 2, for recursive call)
                FIB (recursive call) 
                2 -rot (rotate top 3 values - swap 2nd and 3rd values) 
                + (add top two values) 
                . (print top value) 
            else 
                -1 
                . 
            then 
        else 
            . 
        then ; (end of function declaration) 

    8 FIB (call function, print first 8 numbers in Fibonacci sequence)
