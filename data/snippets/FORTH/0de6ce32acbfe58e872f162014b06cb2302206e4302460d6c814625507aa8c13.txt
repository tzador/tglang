variable size ( This defines a variable called "size" )

: resize ( This is a new word called "resize", which takes in two parameters )
    size ! ( This stores the given size in the "size" variable )
    0 swap ( This puts 0 at the top of the stack and swaps the two parameters )
    0 do ( This is a loop from 0 to the top of the stack )
        dup ( This duplicates the top element of the stack )
        size @ i < ( This checks if the current index is less than the "size" variable )
        if ( If the previous condition is true )
            1+ ( This increments the current index by 1 )
            swap ( This swaps the top two elements of the stack )
            dup ( This duplicates the top element again )
            i size @ > ( This checks if the current index is greater than the "size" variable )
            if ( If the previous condition is true )
                drop ( This drops the top element of the stack )
            else ( If the previous condition is false )
                i size @ ! ( This stores the current index in the "size" variable )
                swap ( This swaps the top two elements of the stack )
            then ( End of inner if statement )
        then ( End of outer if statement )
    loop ( End of the loop )
    size @ 1- ( This decrements the "size" variable by 1 to account for the extra element added )
    swap ( This swaps the top two elements of the stack )
    resize ( This recursively calls the "resize" word to input the remaining elements )

( Example usage: 10 resize 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 )

output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
