\ Sets up a dictionary that defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number

: FACTORIAL \ Creates a new word (FACTORIAL) that will be defined as a function
( n -- n! ) \ Defines the stack inputs and outputs
DUP \ Duplicates the top item on the stack
0 \ Adds 0 to the stack
= IF \ Checks if the two top items on the stack are equal
DROP \ Removes the top item from the stack
1 \ Adds 1 to the stack
ELSE \ If the condition is not met, proceeds to the next line
DUP \ Duplicates the top item on the stack
1 - \ Subtracts 1 from the top item on the stack
RECURSE \ Calls the function being defined (FACTORIAL) again, with the new input
* \ Multiplies the two top items on the stack
THEN \ Ends the IF statement
; \ End of the function definition

\ Example usage: 
5 FACTORIAL \ Returns 120 (5! = 5*4*3*2*1)
