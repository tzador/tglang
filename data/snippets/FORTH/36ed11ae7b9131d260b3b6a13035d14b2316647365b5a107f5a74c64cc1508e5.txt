: factorial ( n -- n! ) \ definition for factorial function that takes one input and returns the factorial of that number
  1 \ pushes 1 onto the stack
  swap \ swaps the top two items on the stack so that the input is now on top
  begin \ starts a loop
    dup \ duplicates the top item on the stack
    1 = \ checks if the duplicated item is equal to 1
    until \ exits the loop when the condition is met
    dup \ duplicates the top item on the stack
    1 - \ subtracts 1 from the duplicated item
    * \ multiplies the top two items on the stack (updates the factorial value)
  repeat \ repeats the loop until the condition is met
  . \ prints the final factorial value
; \ end of function definition
