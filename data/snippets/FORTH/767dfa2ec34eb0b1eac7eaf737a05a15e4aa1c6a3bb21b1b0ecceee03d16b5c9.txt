\ Create a list of the first 15 Fibonacci numbers in FORTH

15 constant MAX    \ Define a constant to hold the total number of Fibonacci numbers we want
variable fib        \ Declare a variable to hold the current Fibonacci number we are calculating

fib 0 !             \ Set the first element in the list to 0
fib 1 !             \ Set the second element in the list to 1

0 1 1               \ Create a loop to generate the rest of the list
MAX 3 do            \ Start the loop with a counter variable set to 3 and the desired total number to generate
  fib 1+ @ swap     \ Retrieve the two previous Fibonacci numbers and swap the order
  over + dup        \ Add the two numbers together and make a copy
  dup fib !         \ Store the current Fibonacci number in the list
  i 2 + swap !      \ Store the updated counter value, incrementing it by 2 to account for the previous two numbers
  fib @             \ Retrieve the current Fibonacci number
loop                \ Loop until the desired number of numbers is generated

fib @ .             \ Print out the list of Fibonacci numbers
