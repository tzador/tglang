\ Abstract code snippet for Fibonacci sequence generation using recursion

: fibonacci ( n -- n-1 n-2 )
    dup 2 < ( Check base condition: return 0 if n < 2 )
    if
        drop 0
    else
        dup 1 -
        recurse ( Call fibonacci recursively with n-1 )
        swap 1 -
        recurse ( Call fibonacci recursively with n-2 )
        + ( Add the two results )
    then 
;

\ Example usage: `5 fibonacci` returns `3 2` as the 5th Fibonacci number is 3 and its preceding number is 2.
