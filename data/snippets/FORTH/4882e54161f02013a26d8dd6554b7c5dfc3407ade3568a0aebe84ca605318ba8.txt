\ Definition of a function to calculate the factorial of a number 
: fact ( n -- res) \ Takes in a number and returns the factorial result 
   0 \ Initialize a variable for the accumulator
   swap \ Swap the number with the accumulator
   begin \ Start of loop
     dup 0 = \ Duplicate the number and check if it is equal to zero
     if \ If it is equal to zero, exit the loop
       drop \ Drop the number from the stack
       1 \ Push 1 to the stack
       exit \ Exit the loop
     then \ End of if
     dup \ Duplicate the number
     over \ Duplicate the number and the accumulator
     * \ Multiply the number and the accumulator
     swap \ Swap the new accumulator with the number
     1 - \ Decrement the number by 1
   again \ Repeat the loop
   drop \ Drop the duplicate number from the stack
   0 swap \ Move the accumulator to the top of the stack
; \ End of function definition
