\ This code snippet uses a loop to generate a random sequence of numbers and displays the sequence with a timer

variable current-time \ variable used to store the current time
: get-time  ( -- n ) 
  time&date ;  \ retrieves the current time and date and pushes it onto the stack
: setup-timer ( -- )
  get-time current-time ! ; \ stores the current time in the variable
: get-random ( -- n )
  random 100 mod ; \ generates a random number between 0 and 100
: display-sequence ( -- )
  50 0 do  \ repeats the following code 50 times
    get-random  . \ calls get-random and prints the result
    cr \ prints a new line
    100 ms \ wait for 100 milliseconds
  loop  \ ends the loop
; \ end of display-sequence definition

setup-timer  \ call setup-timer to set the starting time

\ define a loop to continuously display the sequence every second
begin
  get-time dup current-time @ - 1000 >  \
  while \ checks if 1000 milliseconds have passed since starting time
    display-sequence  \ call display-sequence to print the random numbers
    setup-timer \ reset the starting time
    1000 ms \ wait for 1 second
  repeat \ repeats the loop until the condition is false
\ end of loop definition
