FORTH

In this code snippet, we defined a word called TRIBONACCI that takes in three numbers (n1, n2, n3) and a difference (d) as inputs and returns a sequence of Tribonacci numbers starting from n1, n2, and n3 with a common difference of d. For those unfamiliar with FORTH, a word is essentially a function or subroutine.

`OVER SWAP ROT SWAP` puts n1 and n2 on top of the stack, followed by n3 and d (which was swapped with the top of the stack).

`2DUP 1- < IF 2DROP 2DROP EXIT THEN` checks if the sequence needs to be generated from scratch (if n1 < 0). If this condition is met, we clear the stack and exit the word. Otherwise, we continue generating the sequence.

`>R  2 ROLL  2DUP -  ROT  1+ R>` stores d in a return stack and rotates the top three elements to be n1, n3, and 3d. The 1+ here is necessary to avoid a potential infinite loop if n1 = n2 = n3 = 0.

`3DUP +   1 ROT  3 PICK +` calculates the sum of the first three elements (n1, n2, and n3) and stores it on the stack. The stack now contains d, n1+n2+n3, 3d, and 2d.

`ROT SWAP < IF ...` checks if the sum (n1+n2+n3) is less than 0. If so, we need to generate the sequence from scratch. Otherwise, we go to the next step.

`NIP SWAP 2DUP 3 PICK SWAP ...` stores the current state of the stack and loops through the sequence, adding n2 and n3 to the previous sum (n1+n2+n3). Once the loop is finished, the stack looks like n3, n2, and n1+n2+n3.

`2DROP ROT 1+ 3DUP + DUP 3 PICK +` finishes off the sequence by getting rid of the n3 and n2 values and adding the last two sums to get the next number in the sequence. This process is repeated until the desired number of Tribonacci numbers have been generated.

By annotating the code snippet in this way, we can better understand the logic and flow of the code. FORTH is known for its concise and efficient code, and this snippet is a great example of that.
