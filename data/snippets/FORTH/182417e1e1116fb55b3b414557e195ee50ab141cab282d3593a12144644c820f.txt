\ A function that calculates the factorial of a given number
 \ 'n' is the input number
 
: Factorial ( n -- f )
  dup 0		\ duplicate the input number and check if it is 0
  if
    drop 1	\ if it is 0, drop it and push 1 as the result
  else
    1 swap 	\ if it is not 0, push 1 and swap it with the input number
    begin	\ start of loop
      dup 1 <	\ check if the input number is less than 1
      while	\ loop while it is true
      dup 1 -	\ duplicate the input number and subtract 1 from it
      swap	\ swap the result with the input number
      *		\ multiply the top two numbers on the stack
    repeat	\ end of loop
    drop	\ drop the original input number
  then
;			\ end of the function definition
 
15 Factorial	\ call the function and pass 15 as the input number
\ Output: 1307674368000	\ the factorial of 15
