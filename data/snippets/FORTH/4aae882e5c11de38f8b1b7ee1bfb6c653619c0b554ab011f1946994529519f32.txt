\ Define a recursive function to calculate factorials of a number
: factorial ( n -- result )
    dup 1 = if (exit) 1 else dup 1 - factorial * then ;

\ Define a helper function to print the values of the factorial calculation step by step
: print-factorial ( n -- )
    1 ?do
        i 1 = if (exit) ." 1 " else 1 - factorial . then ( print the number and calculate factorial )
    loop ;

\ Define a word to ask for a number and call both functions to calculate and print the factorial
: ask-factorial ( -- )
    ." Enter a number: "
    ' n1 get nip cr ( get the number and save it to n1 )
    n1 factorial print-factorial
    cr ; ( print a line break )

\ Call the ask-factorial word
ask-factorial
