\ Example of a complex Forth code snippet \
\ This snippet implements a simple Fibonacci sequence calculator. \
 
: fibonacci
variable previous \ create a variable to hold previous result
variable current \ create a variable to hold current result

1000 previous ! \ initialize previous variable to hold first value
1000 current ! \ initialize current variable to hold second value

." 0 1 " \ output first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence

begin
  current @ \ get current result from variable
  previous @ \ get previous result from variable
  + \ add previous and current results
  ." " dup \ print result and duplicate it
  current ! \ store result in current variable
  previous ! \ store previous result in previous variable
  dup 1000 < \ check if result is less than 1000
while \ if result is greater than 1000, exit loop
\ end of loop \

2drop \ drop excess variables

; \ end of definition \

fibonacci \ call subroutine to start calculation of Fibonacci sequence
