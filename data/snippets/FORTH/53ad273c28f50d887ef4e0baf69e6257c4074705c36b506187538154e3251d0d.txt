\ This code snippet is written in FORTH, a stack-based language that uses reverse Polish notation for its syntax.

: FIB ( n -- m)
\ This function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion
   dup 0 = if 
      drop 0 
   else 
      dup 1 = if
         drop 1 
      else 
         dup 1- FIB swap 1- FIB + 
       then
   then
;

\ Example:
5 FIB . \ Output: 5 (the 5th Fibonacci number)
