(also known as "forth")

This is a code snippet for a FORTH program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion:

` : fac ( n -- n! ) dup 2 < if drop 1 else over 1- fac * then ;`

This program defines a word (subroutine) called "fac", which takes in a number (n) as input and outputs its factorial (n!) as output. 

To achieve this, the program checks if the input number (n) is less than 2. If it is, then it drops the input number (n) and pushes 1 as the result. If it is not, then it uses the FORTH word "over" to duplicate the input number (n) and subtracts 1 from it ("over 1-"). This new number is then used as the input for the "fac" word, which calls itself (recursion). Finally, the output of "fac" is multiplied with the duplicated input number (n * fac) and that is the final result.

For example, if we input the number 5, the program will go through the following steps:

1) Duplicate 5 (5 dup) and check if it is less than 2 (5 dup 2 <):
    - Since it is not less than 2, the program proceeds to the "else" statement.
2) Duplicate 5 again (5 dup) and subtract 1 from it (5 dup 1-):
    - Now we have the number 4 as the input for the "fac" word.
3) Call the "fac" word with 4 as the input (4 fac):
    - This leads to another recursive call of "fac", but this time with the input of 3.
4) Continue with recursive calls until we reach the "if" statement with an input of 2.
5) Since 2 is less than 2, the program drops 2 (since it is not needed for calculating factorial), and pushes 1 as the result.
6) The program then multiplies the result (1) with the duplicated input (2 * fac) which in this case is trivial.
7) Finally, the result of 2 * fac is returned, giving us the final result of 120 (5!).

To use this code snippet, you will need a FORTH interpreter/compiler and input any number you want the factorial of in the "( n -- n! )" format, where "n" is your input number and "n!" is the factorial of that number.
