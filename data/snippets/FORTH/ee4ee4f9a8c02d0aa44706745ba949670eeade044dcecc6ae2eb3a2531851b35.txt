: FIBONACCI ( n1 n2 -- n3 n4 ) \This word takes two inputs, n1 and n2, and gives two outputs, n3 and n4, according to the Fibonacci sequence
  2DUP + DUP   \Duplicate n1 twice, add them and copy the result 
  SWAP         \Swap the top two inputs, n2 is now on top
  SWAP         \Swap again, n1 is now on top
  DUPDUP       \Duplicate n1 twice 
  +            \Add the top two inputs, n1 + n2
  SWAP         \Swap n1 and n2, swap top two elements on stack
  2DUP +       \Duplicate n1 and add it to n2, this gives n3
  OVER         \Copy n1, which is now top of stack
  SWAP         \Swap to get n4 on top of stack
  2SWAP ;      \Exchange n1 and n3, then swap n2 and n4
