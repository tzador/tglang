\ Define a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! )
    1 SWAP ( set result to 1 and swap with input n )
    BEGIN ( start of loop )
        DUP 1 > ( duplicate the top of the stack and check if it is greater than 1 )
        WHILE ( conditional to continue loop )
            DUP SWAP ( duplicate the top of the stack and swap it with the second stack element )
            * SWAP ( multiply the top two stack elements and swap them )
        REPEAT ( end of loop )
        2DROP ( drop the last two stack elements, leaving only the factorial result )
    ;

\ Example usage:

5 FACTORIAL . ( output: 120 )
6 FACTORIAL . ( output: 720 )
10 FACTORIAL . ( output: 3628800 )
