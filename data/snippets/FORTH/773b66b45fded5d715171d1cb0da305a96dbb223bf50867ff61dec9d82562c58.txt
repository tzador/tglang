: SHUFFLE ( arr -- arr' )  \ defines a new word called SHUFFLE with the parameter stack 'arr' and returning 'arr' at the end
  ( here we shuffle the elements in the array )
  COUNT ?DUP 0= IF EXIT THEN \ checks if the array has zero length, if so, exits the function
  1-                    \ stores the index of the last element in the array
  DUP 0 ?DO              \ starts a loop from index 0 to the last index (inclusive)
    I 1+ RANDOM         \ generates a random number from index 1 to the last index
    SWAP I PICK         \ picks the element at the random index and swaps it with the current element at index 'I'
    DUP I = IF 1- THEN   \ checks if the index is the same as the last index, if so, decrements the index by 1
  LOOP                   \ ends the loop
