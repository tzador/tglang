\ Below is a complex code snippet in FORTH that calculates the area of a circle given the radius

\ Initialize variables for radius and pi
variable radius
variable pi

\ Set the value of pi
3.14159265358979 pi f!

\ Get input for radius and store it in the variable
." Enter the radius:" radius input

\ Calculate the area using FORTH's built-in DUP and * functions
radius f@ DUP * pi f@ * 2swap /

\ Output the result to the screen
." The area of the circle is: " f. 

\ Sample output for radius = 5:
\ The area of the circle is: 78.53981633974483
