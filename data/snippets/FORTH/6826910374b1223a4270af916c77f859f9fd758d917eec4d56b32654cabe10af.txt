\ An example FORTH code snippet that calculates the factorial of a given number

: FACTORIAL \ Define a new word for calculating factorial 
    DUP 0 = IF           \ Check if the input is 0

    ELSE 
        DUP 1 -          \ Decrement the input by 1 
        FACTORIAL        \ Calling the newly defined word recursively
        *                \ Multiply the result by the input number
