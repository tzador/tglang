dup 0 = \ Duplicate the number and check if it is equal to 0
if \ If it is equal to 0, then stop and output 0
  drop 0 \ Drop the duplicate and output 0
else \ If it is not equal to 0, proceed with the following
  dup 1 = \ Duplicate the number and check if it is equal to 1
  if \ If it is equal to 1, then stop and output 1
    drop 1 \ Drop the duplicate and output 1
  else \ If it is not equal to 1, proceed with the following
    dup 1 - \ Duplicate the number, subtract 1, and duplicate it again
    fibonacci swap \ Call the "fibonacci" word with the duplicated number as input
    1 swap - \ Swap the top two items, subtract 1, and swap them back
    fibonacci + \ Call the "fibonacci" word with the new input, which is the previous number minus 1
    swap \ Swap the top two items
    rotate \ Rotate the top three items
    + \ Add the top two numbers 
  then \ End the if statement
then \ End the if statement and end the definition of "fibonacci" word
