\ This snippet creates a recursive word to find the nth Fibonacci number

: f
  dup 2 < if          \ if number is less than 2, return 1
    drop 1
  else                \ if number is greater than 2, recursively calculate previous two Fibonacci numbers and add them
    dup 1 - f         \ recursively call f to find n-1 Fibonacci number
    swap              \ swap top two stack elements (n-1 and n-2 Fibonacci numbers)
    1 - f             \ recursively call f again to find n-2 Fibonacci number
    +                 \ add the two Fibonacci numbers together
  then ;

9 f                   \ find the 9th Fibonacci number (should return 34)
