1 value n \ create a variable n and assign it a value of 1

: factorial ( n -- n! ) \ define a word (function) called factorial that takes in a number and outputs its factorial
    dup 1 = if \ check if the number is equal to 1
        drop 1 exit \ if true, return 1 and exit the word
    else \ if not equal to 1
        dup 1 - factorial * \ recursively call factorial on the number minus 1 and multiply the result
    then \ end if statement
; \ end word definition
