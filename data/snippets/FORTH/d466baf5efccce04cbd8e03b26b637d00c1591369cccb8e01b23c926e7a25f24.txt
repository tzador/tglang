: CYLINDER    \ creates a function for calculating volume of a cylinder
  ( pi * )    \ multiplies the radius by pi
  \ input: radius
    DUP      \ duplicates the radius on the stack
    DUP      \ duplicates the radius again
    ROT      \ rotates the top three items on the stack
  ( r^2 )    \ squares the radius
  *          \ multiplies the squared radius by pi
  \ input: height
  DUP      \ duplicates the height on the stack
  *           \ multiplies the squared radius by the height
  *           \ multiplies both results together
  'VOL:      \ creates a named constant for the output
  \ output: volume of cylinder
