\ This code snippet demonstrates a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
\ It takes one argument from the stack and returns the factorial of that number
: factorial ( n -- n! )
  dup 0 = if  \ base case: if the argument is 0, return 1
    drop 1 exit 
  else  \ recursive case: calculate n-1 factorial and multiply by n
    dup 1 - factorial * exit
  then
