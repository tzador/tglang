\ This program finds the sum of even numbers from 0 to 50
: even-sum ( n -- n ) \ defines a new word for calculating sum of even numbers
  0 swap 1 swap \ sets a counter and initializes sum value to 0
  begin \ starts a loop
    2dup > while   \ duplicates top two values and checks if the second is greater than the first
      dup 2 mod 0 =  \ duplicates top value, calculates remainder when divided by 2 and checks if it is equal to 0
      if \ if the remainder is 0, execute the following
        swap over + swap \ swaps top two values, adds them, swaps again and stores the result in the sum
      else \ otherwise execute the following
        drop drop \ drops top two values as they are not added to the sum
      then \ ends the if statement
      1+ \ increments counter by 1
    repeat \ repeats the loop until the condition is false, i.e. counter is greater than 50
  2drop \ drops the remaining two values on the stack, as they are no longer needed
;
50 even-sum .  \ calls the defined word and prints the sum of even numbers from 0 to 50
