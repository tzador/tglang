: TRIANGLE ( n -- ) ` define a new word called TRIANGLE`
  DUP 1 > (check if input is larger than one)\
  IF (if input is larger than one, execute the following code)

    SWAP (move input to top of stack)
    . (print the current input)
    2DUP (duplicate input twice)
    - (subtract top two inputs)
    ROT (rotate stack so that top input is back at the bottom)
    2 + (add 2 to top input)
    TRIANGLE (call the TRIANGLE word recursively with new input)
  THEN (end if statement)
  DROP (drop the input from the stack)
