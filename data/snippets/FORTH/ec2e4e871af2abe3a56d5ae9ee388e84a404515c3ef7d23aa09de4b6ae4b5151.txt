\ This code snippet generates the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
: fibonacci       \ Define a new word called "fibonacci"
  swap dup         \ Swap the top two numbers on the stack and duplicate the second number
  over +           \ Duplicate the top number on the stack and add it to the second number
  swap             \ Swap the top two numbers on the stack
;                 \ End of the "fibonacci" word

0                 \ Push the first number in the sequence (0) onto the stack
1                 \ Push the second number in the sequence (1) onto the stack
10                \ Set an upper limit for the sequence
0 do              \ Start a loop from 0 to 9 (10 numbers)
  i fibonacci .   \ Call the "fibonacci" word, passing in the current index (0 to 9)
                  \ and print the result with a space
loop              \ End the loop
