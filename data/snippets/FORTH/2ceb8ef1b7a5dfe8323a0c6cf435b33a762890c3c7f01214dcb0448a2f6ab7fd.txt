1 CONSTANT UPPER-LIMIT \ Creates a constant with the value of 1
: SQUARE DUP * ; \ Creates a word that duplicates the top of the stack and multiplies it, effectively squaring it
: CUBE DUP SQUARE * ; \ Creates a word that duplicates the top of the stack, squares it, and then multiplies by the original value, effectively cubing it
: RANGE ( n1 n2 -- n3 ) \ Creates a word that takes in two numbers on the stack and outputs a range of numbers (inclusive) between them
    OVER - 1 + SWAP \ Takes the duplicate of the upper limit, subtracts it from the lower limit, adds 1 to account for the lower limit, and swaps the two values on the stack
    0 DO \ Starts a loop from 0 to the calculated range
        DUP I + \ Duplicates the current range value and adds it to the loop index
        I ROT \ Rotates the stack so that the loop index is at the bottom
        OVER + SWAP \ Adds the loop index to the lower limit and swaps the two values on the stack
        DUP . \ Duplicates the calculated value and prints it
    LOOP \ Ends the loop
    DROP \ Drops the remaining values on the stack
; \ Ends the word definition
EVALUATE \ Executes the following code
UPPER-LIMIT 1 RANGE \ Calls the RANGE word with the upper and lower limits set to 1
