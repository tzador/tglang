variable x       \ defines a variable named x

: factorial    \ creates a new word called factorial
  dup 1 = if     \ duplicates top stack item and checks if its value is 1
    drop 1      \ if so, drops the duplicated item and pushes a 1 as the result
  else           \ if not, executes the following
    dup 1 -      \ duplicates top stack item and subtracts 1 from its value
    factorial   \ recursively calls the factorial word
    *           \ multiplies the top two stack items (the current value and the result of the recursive call)
  then           \ ends the if statement
;

: print-hello   \ creates a new word called print-hello
  ." Hello, World!" \ prints the string "Hello, World!" to the output
;

: main          \ creates a new word called main
  5 factorial   \ calls the factorial word with 5 as the argument
  print-hello   \ calls the print-hello word to print "Hello, World!"
;

main            \ calls the main word to execute the program
