\ Program to calculate the Fibonacci series

\ define variables
variable n       ( used to store user input for number of terms )
variable fib1    ( used to store first number in the series )
variable fib2    ( used to store second number in the series )
variable fibNext ( used to store the next number in the series )

: fibonacci
  begin

    \ ask user for number of terms in the series
    ." Enter the number of terms in Fibonacci series: " cr
    n !

    \ set initial values for the first and second number
    fib1 0 !
    fib2 1 !

    \ print first and second numbers
    ." The first number in the series is " fib1 . cr
    ." The second number in the series is " fib2 . cr

    \ loop for n-2 times to calculate remaining terms
    n @ 2 - times
      fib2 fibNext  \ calculate next number in the series
      fibNext fib2 ! \ store next number as second number
      fibNext . cr   \ print next number
    loop

  \ end loop
  again
