: FACT DUP 0 MORE IF OVER SWAP * SWAP 1- RECURSE ELSE DROP 1 THEN ;
=> This code snippet defines a factorial function in FORTH, which takes in a number as input and returns the factorial of that number. It uses a recursive approach, calling itself with a decreasing input value until it reaches 0 where it returns 1. It also checks for the base case (input of 0) to avoid an infinite loop.
