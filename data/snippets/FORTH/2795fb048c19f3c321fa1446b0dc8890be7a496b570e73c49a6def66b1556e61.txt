variable n \ defining a variable to store an integer value
: fibonacci \ creating a new function called fibonacci
  n 2 < \ check if n is less than 2
  if \ if statement execution
    n \ will return the current value stored in n
  else \ else statement execution
    n 1- recurse \ subtract 1 from n and call the fibonacci function recursively
    r@ n 2 - recurse \ get the value stored in r and subtract 2 from n, then call the fibonacci function recursively again
    r@ + \ add the two recursive results and return the sum as the fibonacci number
  then \ end of if statement
; \ end of function definition
10 fibonacci \ calling the fibonacci function with n = 10 and printing the result
\ Output: 55 (the 10th fibonacci number)
