**Explanation:** This code defines a factorial function which takes in a number and returns its factorial value. It uses a recursive approach, calling itself with the number decremented by 1 until it reaches 1, at which point it returns 1. The syntax and flow control in FORTH can be a bit obscure but essentially this code checks if the number is 1, if yes then it drops it and outputs 1. If not, it decrements the number, multiplies it with the result of calling the factorial function again, and outputs the result. The last part of the code snippet calls this function with different numbers and outputs their factorial values.
