\ The following code snippet demonstrates how to find the Fibonacci series up to a given number

: fib	\ start of the fib function definition
	0 1	\ initialize first two digits of the series
	begin	\ start of the loop
	  over over + swap	\ add last two digits and swap to the top for next round
	  dup .	\ duplicate top value and print to screen
	until	\ repeat until the given number is reached
	drop	\ drop the last value (which is above the limit)
;

10 fib	\ calling the fib function with a limit of 10
\ Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
