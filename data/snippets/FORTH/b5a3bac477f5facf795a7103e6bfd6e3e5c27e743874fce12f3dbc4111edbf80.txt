( This is a complex code snippet in FORTH that generates a recursive factorial function )

: factorial ( n -- n! )
    dup 0 =       ( if n is 0, return 1 )
    if
        drop 1
    else           ( else, call recursive function with n-1 and multiply by n )
        dup 1 -     ( decrement n by 1 )
        factorial   ( call recursive function )
        *           ( multiply result of function with n )
    then ;

( example usage )
6 factorial      ( calculates 6 factorial, output: 720 )
