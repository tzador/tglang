\ This code snippet generates a random sequence of numbers using the FORTH programming language.

Randomize \ initializes the random number generator

: ?seed \ function to set the seed for the random number generator
    new-seed  \ assigns the new seed value to the variable 'seed'
    <filter>  \ applies any necessary filters to the seed value
    seed !    \ stores the filtered seed in the variable 'seed'

: new-seed \ function to generate a new random seed
    r>id \ retrieve the current date and time in seconds as a number
    swap \ swap the first and second values on the data stack
    + \ add the two values together
    >r \ move the result to the return stack

: <filter> \ function to apply filters to the seed value
    even? \ check if the seed is an even number
    0= \ determine if the seed is equal to zero
    if \ if the seed is zero or even, increment it by 1
        1 +
    then
    2* \ multiply the seed by 2 to increase randomness

: #random \ function to generate a random number between 0 and the given limit
    m* \ multiply the seed by the limit to get a random integer
    drop \ drop the remaining seed value from the data stack

: random \ function to generate a random number between 0 and 1
    0 ?seed \ set the seed using the current date and time in seconds
    0 #random \ generate a random number between 0 and 1
    f/float \ convert the integer to a floating-point number between 0 and 1
    1+ \ add 1 to include 1 in the possible range of numbers

: random-sequence \ function to generate a sequence of random numbers
    depth dup 1 = if \ check if there is only one element on the stack
        2dup \ duplicate the sequence limit and limit values
        1 = if \ if the sequence is only 1 number, drop the limit value
            1drop \ drop the limit value
        else \ if the sequence is more than 1 number, swap the limit values
            swap
        then
    then
    \ loop through the sequence
    begin
        dup #random \ generate a random number between 0 and 1
        swap #random \ generate a random number between 0 and the limit value
        swap #random \ generate a random number between 0 and the limit value
        swap #random \ generate a random number between 0 and the limit value
        rot \ rotate the sequence limit to the top of the stack
        1 - \ decrement the sequence limit by 1
    until
    dup 2 = if \ if the sequence has 2 numbers, drop the limit value
        1drop
    then
    swap \ swap the sequence and limit values
    1- \ decrement the limit value by 1 to get the correct range of numbers
    #random \ generate a random number between 0 and the limit value

: .sequence \ function to print a sequence of numbers
    begin depth dup ?dup while \ while there are still numbers to print
        dup #. \ print the top of the stack
        drop \ drop the top of the stack
    repeat \ repeat the loop until all numbers have been printed

10 random-sequence .sequence \ generate and print a sequence of 10 random numbers between 0 and 9
