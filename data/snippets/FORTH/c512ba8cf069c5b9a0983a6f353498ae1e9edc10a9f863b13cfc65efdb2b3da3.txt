\ calculate the factorial of a given number

: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! ) \ defines a word called FACTORIAL that takes in a number and returns its factorial value
  DUP 0 = IF  \ checks if the input is 0, if it is, return 1
    DROP 1
  ELSE \ if input is not equal to 0, continue
    DUP 1 = IF \ checks if the input is equal to 1, if it is, return 1
      DROP 1
    ELSE \ if input is not equal to 1, continue
      DUP 1 - \ subtracts 1 from the input
      FACTORIAL  \ recursively calls the FACTORIAL word
      * \ multiplies the result from the recursive call with the current input value
    THEN \ ends the IF statement
  THEN \ ends the IF statement

; \ ends the word definition

10 FACTORIAL \ calls the FACTORIAL word with the input value of 10 and prints the result on the stack
