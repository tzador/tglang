( Defines a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number )

: fact ( n -- n! )
  dup 1 = (checks if n is equal to 1)
  if (if equal, end recursion by returning 1)
    drop 1 (dropping argument and returning 1)
  else (if not equal, calculate n!)
    dup 1 - (decreasing n by 1)
    fact * (recursive call to calculate n-1!)
  then 
; (end of function definition)
