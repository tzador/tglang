\ Define a word that will check if a number is prime
: prime? ( n -- flag )
    dup 0 > ( check if number is positive )
    if ( if positive, continue )
        0 ( initialize a counter )
        dup 2 ( store a copy of the number and initial counter value )
        do ( loop from 0 to number-1 )
            dup ( duplicate the counter )
            i ( get current loop index )
            rem ( get remainder of number divided by counter )
            0 = ( check if remainder is equal to 0 )
            if ( if remainder is 0, number is divisible )
                drop ( drop the counter value )
                0 ( set flag to false )
                leave ( exit loop )
            else ( if remainder is not 0 )
                i ( increment counter )
            then
        loop ( end loop )
    else ( if number is not positive )
        drop ( drop the number )
        0 ( set flag to false )
    then
; ( end word definition )
