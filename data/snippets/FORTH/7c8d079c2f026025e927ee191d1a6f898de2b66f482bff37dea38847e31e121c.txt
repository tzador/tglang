Variable stack       \ defines a variable called stack
: push               \ creates a word called push
    stack dup !      \ pushes the top item of the stack onto itself
    1 stack +!       \ adds 1 to the top item of the stack
    cr               \ moves cursor to next line
;                    \ ends the word definition for push
: pop                \ creates a word called pop
    stack @          \ retrieves the top item of the stack
    stack dup @ !    \ sets the top item of the stack to itself
    cr               \ moves cursor to next line
;                    \ ends the word definition for pop
: dup                \ creates a word called dup
    stack @          \ retrieves the top item of the stack
    stack dup !      \ pushes the top item of the stack onto itself
    cr               \ moves cursor to next line

: swap               \ creates a word called swap
    stack @ 2         \ retrieves the top two items of the stack
    -rot              \ rotates the stack, swapping the top two items
    stack dup @ !      \ sets the top item of the stack to itself
