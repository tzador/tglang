\ Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
: factorial \ name of the function
  dup 1 = if (when the input is 1) 
    drop 1  \ return 1
  else (when the input is not 1) 
    dup 1 - factorial * \ multiply the input with the factorial of the input - 1 
  then ; \ end function definition

\ To test the factorial function
5 factorial . \ this should output 120 (5! = 120)
