This code snippet defines a function called GCD, which stands for Greatest Common Divisor.
The function takes in two values, a and b, and returns their greatest common divisor.
To begin, the first value is duplicated using the DUP command and checked if it is equal to 0.
If it is, then the value is dropped and the process is repeated with the second value.
Once a non-zero value is found, the loop exits.
The values are then swapped so that the second value becomes the first value.
Next, a BEGIN loop is initiated, which will continue to loop until the top value on the stack is 0.
Within the loop, the top value on the stack is duplicated and used to mod the second value.
The result is then pushed back onto the stack using the TUCK command.
This process is repeated until the top value on the stack becomes 0.
Once the loop exits, the top value on the stack is dropped, leaving only the greatest common divisor.
