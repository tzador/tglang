: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! ) \ Creates a new word called FACTORIAL that calculates the factorial of a given number n
    1 SWAP   \ Initialize the factorial result with 1 and swap it with the number on the top of the stack
    BEGIN \ Begin a loop
        DUP \ Duplicate the topmost element on the stack
        1 - \ Decrement by 1
        DUP 0 > \ Duplicate and check if the duplicated number is greater than 0
    WHILE \ While the duplicated number is greater than zero, continue the loop
        *  \ Multiply the factorial result and the duplicated number
    REPEAT  \ End the loop
    DROP \ Drop the duplicated number
