\ This code snippet implements a binary search algorithm in FORTH

variable array \ creates a variable to hold the array of values
10 array allot \ allots 10 cells of memory to store the array

: populate-array ( n -- ) \ creates a word to populate the array with random values
    0 array ! \ sets the starting address of the array
    0 do \ loop n number of times to populate the array
        i array + random \ adds a random value to the current array index
        array ! \ stores the value in the array
    loop
; \ end of populate-array word

: binary-search ( key -- index|0 ) \ creates a word to perform binary search on the array
    0 array ! \ sets the starting address of the array
    array @ 1- array @ / 2 \ calculates the middle index of the array
    begin
        dup array + \ moves to the middle index of the array
        dup @ key < \ compares the array value at the middle index with the key
        if \ if the key is smaller than the array value
            swap drop 1- \ moves the index to the element before the middle index
        else \ otherwise
            1+ swap drop \ moves the index to the element after the middle index
        then
        dup array = \ checks if the key is equal to the array value at the current index
    until \ repeats the loop until the key is found or all elements have been checked
    if \ if the key is found
        drop \ removes the key on top of the stack and returns 0 as the index
    else \ if the key is not found
        drop -1 \ returns -1 as the index
    then
; \ end of binary-search word

: main \ creates a word to execute the binary search algorithm
    "Enter key to search: " . \ prompts the user to enter the key to search
    key number . cr \ reads the input key and displays it
    populate-array \ calls the populate-array word to generate the array with random values
    dup 0= \ checks if the array is empty
    if \ if the array is empty
        ."Array is empty" cr \ prints a message indicating the array is empty
    else \ if the array is not empty
        "Enter key to search: " . \ prompts the user to enter the key to search
        binary-search . cr \ calls the binary-search word and displays the index of the key
    then
; \ end of main word

main \ calls the main word to execute the program
