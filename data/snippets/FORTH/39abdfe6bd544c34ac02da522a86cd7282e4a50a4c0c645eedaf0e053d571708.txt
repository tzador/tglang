  \ This word calculates a complex hash value based on three input parameters. 
  \ The hash is calculated by first squaring the first two parameters, multiplying by 3, 
  \ then rotating the top three items and adding their product to the top of the stack. 
  \ Next, the top two items are squared, multiplied by 5 and rotated right by 5 bits, 
  \ then XORed with the bottom item, multiplied by the top item, rotated left by 7 bits, 
  \ and finally added to the current hash value. This process is repeated twice, 
  \ ensuring a complex and unique hash.
