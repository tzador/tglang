\ This code snippet is a FORTH program that implements a binary tree and its associated functions \
: binary-tree ( n -- t ) \ create a binary tree with n nodes \
   0 list allot \ allocate space for the tree \
   1 swap \ bring n to top of stack \
   begin \ loop until n is 0 \
      dup \ duplicate n \
      0 list allot \ allocate space for a new node \
      over rot \ bring new node to top of stack \
      -rot \ bring tree to top of stack \
      swap \ swap tree and new node \
      ! \ store new node in tree \
      dup 1- \ decrement n \
   0= until \ end of loop when n is 0 ;
   
: add-node ( t v -- t ) \ add new node with value v to tree t \
   0 ?DO \ loop through all nodes in tree \
      over dup \ duplicates value v on top of stack \
      1?null \ check if node is empty \
      if \ if it is empty, create new node \
         over rot \ bring new node to top of stack \
         -rot \ bring tree to top of stack \
         swap \ swap tree and new node \
         ! \ store new node in tree \
         2drop \ drop value v from stack \
         exit \ exit loop \
      else \ if not empty, compare values and place in left or right branch \
         dup @ \ get value of current node \
         over @ < \ if value is less than current node, go to left branch, else go to right branch \
         if \ if value is less, go to left branch \
            dup left @ >R \ save current node as new tree to explore \
            left R> dup add-node \ recursively call function to add node to left branch \
            swap ! \ store updated left branch in current node \
         else \ if value is greater, go to right branch \
            dup right @ >R \ save current node as new tree to explore \
            right R> dup add-node \ recursively call function to add node to right branch \
            swap ! \ store updated right branch in current node \
         then \ end if for comparison \
      then \ end if for null check \
      1+ \ increment loop counter \
   LOOP \ end loop ;
   
: print-tree ( t -- ) \ print tree in order \
   \ recursive function \
   dup 1?null \ check if node is empty \
   0= \ if not empty, print tree \
   if \ if not empty, print left branch \
      dup left @ >R \ save current node as new tree to explore \
      left R> print-tree \ recursively call function to print left branch \
   then \ end if for null check \
   . \ print value of current node \
   dup right @ >R \ save current node as new tree to explore \
   right R> print-tree \ recursively call function to print right branch ;
   
\ Example usage: \
5 binary-tree \ creates a binary tree with 5 nodes \
10 5 add-node \ adds a node with value 10 to the tree \
2 5 add-node \ adds a node with value 2 to the tree \
1 5 add-node \ adds a node with value 1 to the tree \
print-tree \ prints the tree in order, output: 1 2 5 10
