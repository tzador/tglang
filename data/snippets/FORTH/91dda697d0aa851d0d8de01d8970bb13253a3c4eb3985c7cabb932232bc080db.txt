: power ( n1 n2 -- n3 )       \ defines a word named "power" that takes two numbers and returns their power
    1 swap                    \ swap the numbers so that the exponent is on top
    0 0 do                    \ start a do-loop with two variables set to 0
        2dup                 \ duplicate the exponent and base numbers 
        -                    \ subtract the two numbers
        i =                  \ compare them and return the result (true or false)
