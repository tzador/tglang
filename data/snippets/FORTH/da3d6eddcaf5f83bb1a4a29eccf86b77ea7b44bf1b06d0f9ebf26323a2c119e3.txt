\ This code snippet calculates the maximum value of two given numbers using the FORTH programming language.

\ Define function to swap top two numbers on stack
: swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1)
    begin  \ Start loop to swap
        over  \ Duplicate second number on stack
        rot \ Rotate top three numbers on stack
        rot \ Rotate top three numbers on stack
        1 - \ Decrement loop counter
    dup while \ Loop while counter is not equal to 0
    drop \ Drop loop counter from stack
;

\ Function to calculate maximum value of two numbers
: max ( n1 n2 -- max)
    dup \ Duplicate second number on stack
    swap \ Swap numbers on stack
    > \ Check if first number is greater than second number
    if \ If condition is true, first number is maximum
        drop \ Drop second number from stack
    else \ If condition is false, second number is maximum
        swap \ Swap numbers on stack to bring second number to top
        drop \ Drop first number from stack
    then \ End if statement

\ Main program
: main
    4 3 max . \ Call max function with two numbers and print result
