." This snippet is a FORTH program that calculates and prints the factorial of a given number." \ This is a comment that explains the purpose of the code

: factorial \ This defines a procedure called 'factorial'
  dup 0=                          \ Duplicate the top of the stack and check if it is equal to zero
  if                              \ If it is, go to the next instruction
    drop 1                         \ Drop the top of the stack and replace it with a 1
  else
    dup 1 =                        \ Duplicate the top of the stack and check if it is equal to 1
    if                              \ If it is, go to the next instruction
      drop 1                       \ Drop the top of the stack and replace it with a 1
    else
      dup 1- factorial *           \ Duplicate the top of the stack, subtract 1, call 'factorial' and multiply the results
    then
  then
;

: print-factorial \ This defines a procedure called 'print-factorial'
  . cr                          \ Print the top of the stack (factorial) and add a new line
;

8 factorial print-factorial \ Call the procedures 'factorial' with the number 8 and then call 'print-factorial'
