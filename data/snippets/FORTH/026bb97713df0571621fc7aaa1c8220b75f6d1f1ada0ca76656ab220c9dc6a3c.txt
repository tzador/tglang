\ This code snippet uses FORTH's stack-based reverse polish notation to calculate the factorial of a given number

: fact dup 1 > if dup 1 - recurse * then ; \ this word recursively multiplies the number on top of the stack by the factorial of one less than that number

: factorial 1 swap fact ; \ this word swaps the given number and then calls the fact word to calculate its factorial

20 factorial . \ outputs the factorial of 20 on the console
