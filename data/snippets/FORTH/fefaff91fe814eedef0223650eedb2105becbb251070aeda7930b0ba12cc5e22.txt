: PRIME-FACTORS ( n -- factors ) \ Forth code to find prime factors of a given number
  2 DUP 0 DO \ Starts a loop from 2 to given number
    DUP OVER MOD = IF \ Checks if current number is divisible by current loop index
      I \ If yes, push index to stack (prime factor)
      / \ Divide current number by index
      SWAP DROP \\ Push current number to stack and drop index
      I 1 - DO DVPOS LOOP \ Uses DVPOS word to divide by the prime factor n times
    THEN
    DUP 2 > IF \ Checks if number is greater than 2, else no more factors
      1+ \ If yes, increment number by one
    ELSE
      DROP \ If no, drop number and continue loop
    THEN
  LOOP \\
  DROP ; \\ Ends the definition of the word
