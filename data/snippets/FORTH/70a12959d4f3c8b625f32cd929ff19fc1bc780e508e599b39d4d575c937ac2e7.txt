\ a FORTH program that calculates the Nth term in the Fibonacci sequence

\ initialize variables
variable n \ holds the Nth term
variable result \ holds the calculated result

: fibonacci \ defines the fibonacci word
  dup 0 = \ checks if n = 0
  if \ if it is, set result to 0
    drop 0 \ drops n and sets result to 0
  else \ if n is not 0, continue with the calculation
    dup 1 = \ checks if n = 1
    if \ if it is, set result to 1
      drop 1 \ drops n and sets result to 1
    else \ if n is not 1, continue with the calculation
      2 - dup fibonacci swap 1 - fibonacci + \ recursive calls to fibonacci
      result ! \ stores the calculated value in the result variable
    then
  then 
;

: get-fibonacci \ defines the get-fibonacci word
  n @ fibonacci . \ fetches the input value for n and calls the fibonacci word, prints the result
;

10 get-fibonacci \ calls the get-fibonacci word with an input n = 10
