Variable sum
sum C@ 0= IF 0 THEN C@ sum + sum C!

This code snippet creates a variable `sum` and assigns it a value of 0. Then, it checks the value stored at the memory location of `sum` using the `C@` word and compares it to 0 using the `0=` word. If the comparison is true (meaning the value stored at `sum` is 0), then the `IF` word executes a 0 (representing the number 0) and the `THEN` word ends the conditional statement. If the comparison is false, the `IF` statement is skipped and the code moves on to the next line which adds the value stored at `sum` (0) to the current value of `sum` and then stores the new sum back in the memory location of `sum` using the `C!` word.
