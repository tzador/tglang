: SWAP ( a b -- b a ) \ This word takes 2 inputs and swaps their positions on the stack
     2DUP  OVER  ROT  ROT  2SWAP  ; \ This line creates a word SWAP
     \ What is happening: \ 2DUP duplicates the top 2 items on the stack
                          \ OVER duplicates the item below the top item on the stack
                          \ ROT rotates the top 3 items on the stack, making the third item the top item
                          \ 2SWAP swaps the top two items on the stack with the next two items
