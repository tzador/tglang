\ A program to calculate the value of a Fibonacci number
 
: fib \ start of fib definition
  0 1 swap \ initialize stack with variables 0 and 1, then swap them
  dup 0= if \ if top of stack is 0, jump to recursive case
    drop drop exit \ remove unused variables and exit
  else \ start of recursive case
    dup 1- swap \ duplicate top of stack, decrement it, then swap top two variables
    dup fib swap + \ call fib recursively, swap the variables, and add them together
  then \ end of if statement
; \ end of fib definition
 
8 fib . \ output the value of the 8th Fibonacci number
