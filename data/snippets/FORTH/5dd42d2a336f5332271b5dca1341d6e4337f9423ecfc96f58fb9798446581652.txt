\ Calculates the factorial of a given number

: factorial ( n -- n! )
    dup 0 = (if)          \ if n = 0, then return 1
        drop 1 exit
    else
        dup 1 -             \ decrement n by 1
        dup factorial       \ recursively call factorial with n-1
        *                   \ multiply result by n
    then ;

5 factorial .            \ output: 120
8 factorial .            \ output: 40320
