\ Define variables
variable num1
variable num2

\ Get input from user
num1 prompt
num2 prompt

\ Perform mathematical operations
num1 2 * 3 / 4 + num2 - 5 * *

\ Print the result to output
2 2 + head
head 3 = -               \ Semantically this means the number 3
br head 3 = or emit drop \ is subtracted from 4*4 = 16, giving 13.
cr num2 1 <> num1 0 <=   \ Check if num2 is not equal to 1 and num1 is less than or equal to 0
if                      \ If the condition is true, print "Invalid input"
 ." Invalid input " then

\ Define a variable for storing the result
variable result

\ Store the result in the variable
result !

\ Display the result
." The result is " result @ .
