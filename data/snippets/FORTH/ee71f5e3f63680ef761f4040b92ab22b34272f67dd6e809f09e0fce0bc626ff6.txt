: DISTANCE ( x1 y1 x2 y2 -- d ) \ This function calculates the distance between two points in a Cartesian coordinate system
  DUP \ Duplicates the top item on the stack (x1 y1 x2 y2 x1)
  OVER \ Copies the second item from the top of the stack to the top (x1 y1 x2 y2 x1 y1)
  ROT \ Rotates the top three items of the stack (x1 y1 y2 x2 y1 x1)
  2DUP \ Duplicates the top two items on the stack (x1 y1 y2 x2 y1 x1 y1)
  - \ Subtracts the top two items on the stack and pushes the result to the top (x1 y1 y2 x2 y1 d) \ d = x1 - x2
  2DUP \ Duplicates the top two items on the stack (x1 y1 y2 x2 y1 d d)
  * \ Multiplies the top two items on the stack and pushes the result to the top (x1 y1 y2 x2 d^2) \ d^2 = (x1-x2)^2
  OVER \ Copies the second item from the top of the stack to the top (x1 y1 y2 x2 d^2 d^2)
  + \ Adds the top two items on the stack and pushes the result to the top (x1 y1 y2 d^2 r^2) \ r^2 = (x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2
  SQRT \ Takes the square root of the top item on the stack (x1 y1 y2 d r) \ r = sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)
  2DROP \ Drops the top two items on the stack, leaving only the distance (x1 y1 y2 d)
