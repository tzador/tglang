\ This program calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive approach

: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! )
  DUP 0 = IF   \ checks if n is equal to 0
    DROP 1 EXIT    \ if so, returns 1 and exits the recursive call
  THEN
  DUP 1- SWAP FACTORIAL   \ calls the FACTORIAL word recursively on n-1
  * ;   \ multiplies the result of the recursive call with the current value of n and returns it

\ Example calculation of 5!
5 FACTORIAL
\ Output: 120
