\ Code snippet to calculate the factorial of a number in FORTH

: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! )
    1 SWAP           \ Set accumulator variable to 1 and swap with n
    BEGIN           \ Start of loop
        DUP         \ Duplicate top of stack (n)
        > 0         \ Check if n is greater than 0
    WHILE           \ End of loop if n is 0
        DUP         \ Duplicate top of stack (n)
        *           \ Multiply accumulator by n
        1 -         \ Decrement n by 1
        SWAP        \ Swap accumulator with n
    REPEAT          \ Repeat loop while n is greater than 0
    DROP ;          \ Drop remaining n from stack, leaving only n!

9 FACTORIAL .       \ Output the factorial of 9 (362880)
