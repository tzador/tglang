: FIB ( n -- ) \ Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive approach
  1 1 SWAP \ Push 1 and 1 onto the stack, swap them so 1 is on top
  2 DUP \ Push a copy of 2 onto the stack
  > IF \ If the input is greater than 2, execute the following code
    BEGIN \ Begin a loop
    ROT ROT + \ Rotate the top three stack elements and add the top two together
    DUP \ Duplicate the sum
    \ Since we are using two DUPs, we now have three copies on the stack
    DUP \ Push a copy of the third element onto the stack
    2 > IF \ If the third element is greater than 2, execute the following code
      DUP \ Duplicate the third element
      2 - \ Subtract 2 from the duplicated element
      RECURSE \ Call the FIB function recursively with the new input
    THEN \ End the IF statement
    LOOP \ End the loop
  ELSE \ If the input is 2 or less, execute the following code
    DROP \ Drop the second copy of 2 from the stack
  THEN \ End the IF statement
; \ End the function definition

10 FIB \ Call the FIB function with 10 as the input
