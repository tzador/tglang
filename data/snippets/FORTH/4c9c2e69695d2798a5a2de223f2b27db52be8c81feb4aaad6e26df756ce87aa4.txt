\ This is a FORTH code snippet that implements a recursive factorial function
: factorial ( n -- n! ) \ Defines the factorial function
    dup 0 = if \ Checks if n is equal to 0
        drop 1 \ If so, drops n and returns 1 
    else \ Otherwise, proceeds to else block
        dup 1 - \ Duplicates n and subtracts 1 
        factorial \ Calls recursive factorial function
        * \ Multiplies top two items on the stack
    then \ Ends the if statement
; \ End of factorial definition
20 factorial . \ Calculates factorial of 20 and prints the result
