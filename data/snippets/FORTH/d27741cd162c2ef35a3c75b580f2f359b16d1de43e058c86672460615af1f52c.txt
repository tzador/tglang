: depth-recursive //Starting a definition to recursively find the depth of a stack
  depth //Gets the depth of the stack and pushes it onto the stack
  1 - //Subtracts 1 from the depth value
  depth //Recursively calls the depth-recursive definition
  depth //Gets the current stack depth
  1 + //Adds 1 to the current stack depth

//Example usage
2 4 6 8 10 depth-recursive //Calls the depth-recursive definition, which returns the value 5
