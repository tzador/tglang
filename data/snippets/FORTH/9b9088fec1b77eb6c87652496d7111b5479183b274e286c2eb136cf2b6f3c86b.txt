\ This is a code snippet in FORTH that uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number

: factorial ( n -- n! ) 
    dup 1 = if 
        drop 1 
    else 
        dup 1 - 
        1 - factorial 1 + * 
    then 
; 

\ The factorial function takes in a number and returns its factorial value 
\ The 'dup' command duplicates the top element on the stack 
\ The '1 =' command checks if the number is equal to 1 
\ If it is, the number is dropped and 1 is returned 
\ If not, the number is decreased by 1 and the factorial function is called recursively 
\ Once the factorial function reaches 1, the number is multiplied by 1 and added to the current stack element 
\ This process continues until the original number is reached 
\ Example input: 5 
\ Example output: 120
