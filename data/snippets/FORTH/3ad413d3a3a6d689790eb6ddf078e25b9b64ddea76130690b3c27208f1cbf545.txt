: CALCULATE ( x y -- x+y ) \ This is a word that takes two inputs, x and y, and returns x+y
  + \ Addition operation
;
: QUADRATIC ( a b c -- x1 x2 ) \ This is a word that takes three inputs, a, b, and c, and uses the quadratic formula to solve for the roots, x1 and x2
  DUP \ Duplicate the input values
  2 /ROT \ Rotate the inputs to make them easier to work with
  DUP * \ Square the value of a
  SWAP * NEGATE \ Calculate -4ac
  SWAP SQRT \ Calculate the square root of -4ac
  2DUP + \ Add the values of b and the square root of -4ac
  2 / \ Divide the values by 2
  ROT \ Rotate the values again to their original positions
  / * \ Multiply the values of a and the sum of b and the square root of -4ac
  SWAP / \ Divide by the value of a
  SWAP NEGATE \ Negate the value
  OVER \ Duplicate the negated value
  NEGATE + \ Calculate the sum of the negated value and b
  /SWAP \ Swap the values of b and the sum
  2 / \ Divide by 2 to get the value of x2
  SWAP NEGATE \ Negate the value of x2
; \ End of the QUADRATIC word
