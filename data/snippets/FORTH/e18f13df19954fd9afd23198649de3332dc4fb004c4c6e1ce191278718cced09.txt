: FIB ` This code snippet calculates the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive approach
  1 0 ` start the sequence with the first 2 numbers
  0 1 ` (zero is the 0th number and one is the 1st number in the sequence)
  2 ` set a counter to keep track of the number of iterations
BEGIN ` start a loop
  DUP ` duplicate the top number on the stack (the previous number in the sequence)
  SWAP ` move the top number on the stack (the current number in the sequence) below the next number
  OVER ` duplicate the top two numbers on the stack (the previous and current numbers)
  + ` add the previous and current numbers to get the next number in the sequence
  DUP ` duplicate the next number (to be used in the next iteration)
  DUP . ` print the next number
  1+ ` increment the counter
  20 = ` check if 20 iterations have been completed
UNTIL ` continue looping until 20 iterations are completed
DROP ` drop the remaining number on the stack (the counter) to clean up the stack
