\ This code snippet defines a procedure called 'polynomial'
\ that takes in a list of coefficients and a variable 'x', and outputs
\ the value of the polynomial function using Horner's method.
: polynomial ( coefficients x -- value)
    0 swap ( initialize value to 0 and swap coefficients for easier access)
    ?do
        dup rot * + ( multiply value by current coefficient and add it to the running total)
    loop
    swap nip ( swap and remove extra copy of 'x' from the stack)
    + ( add last coefficient to final value)
; \ end of procedure definition
