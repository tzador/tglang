: QUADRATIC ( a b c -- x1 x2 )
    \ This function takes in three numbers and returns the roots of a quadratic equation
    \ The inputs are the coefficients a, b, c of the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0
    \ The outputs are the roots x1 and x2
    \ First, we calculate the discriminant
    DUP * 4 * SWAP * 
    \ Next, we check if the discriminant is positive or negative
    0 < IF
        \ If positive, we calculate the two roots using the quadratic formula
        SQRT SWAP 2DUP * OVER - OVER 2 /
        \ Return the roots in the correct order
        ROT SWAP 
    ELSE
        \ If negative, we return the roots as imaginary numbers
        DROP DUP - SQRT 2DUP 2 */i
        \ Return the roots in the correct order
