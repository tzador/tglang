: FACTORIAL ( n -- n! ) \ defines a function FACTORIAL that takes in a number and outputs its factorial
   1 SWAP \ initializes a counter variable with value 1 and swaps it with the initial input number
   BEGIN \ starts a loop until specified condition is met
      DUP 1 < \ duplicates the counter variable, checks if it is less than 1
      IF \ if condition is true, execute the following code
         DROP EXIT \ drops the top value (counter variable) and exits the function
      THEN \ ends the if statement
      SWAP DUP * \ duplicates current counter variable, multiplies it with the top value (initialized with value 1) and swaps it with the top value (updated counter variable)
      1 - \ decrements the counter by 1
   REPEAT \ repeats the loop until condition is met
