# Introduction

Welcome to my great article! In this main section, we will explore the features and capabilities of **MARKDOWN** language.

## Basics

First, let's start with the basic syntax of **MARKDOWN**. It is a lightweight markup language that is easy to write and read. Here's an example of a list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

You can also use **bold** and *italic* formatting, and create [links](https://example.com) to other websites.

## Advanced Features

**MARKDOWN** also has advanced features that can enhance the formatting of your text. For example, you can create tables:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Value 1  | Value 2  |
| Value 3  | Value 4  |

You can also add images to your article:
