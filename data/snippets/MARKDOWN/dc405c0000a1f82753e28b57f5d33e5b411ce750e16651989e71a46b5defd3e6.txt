# Introduction
Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text documents. It is designed to be easy to read and write, while also converting easily to HTML for publishing on the web. Markdown is widely used for writing documentation, creating project wikis, and more.

## Basic Syntax
### Headings
To create a heading, simply add one or more # symbols before your text. The number of # symbols indicates the level of heading, with one # being the largest heading and six # symbols being the smallest.

### Emphasis
To emphasize text, you can use either * or _ symbols before and after the text. Single symbols will italicize the text, while double symbols will bold the text.

### Lists
#### Ordered List
To create an ordered list, simply add numbers before each line of text. Markdown will automatically format the numbers into a numbered list.

#### Unordered List
To create an unordered list, simply add a dash or asterisk before each line of text. Markdown will automatically format the symbols into bullet points.

### Links
#### Inline Links
To create an inline link, use square brackets [] to surround the text you want to display and parenthesis () to surround the URL.

#### Reference Links
To create a reference link, use square brackets [] to surround the text you want to display and square brackets with an ID before the URL. The ID is then defined at the bottom of the page using square brackets followed by a colon and the URL.

### Images
#### Inline Images
To add an inline image, use exclamation marks before and after the text, with square brackets for alt text and parenthesis for the image URL.

#### Reference Images
To add a reference image, use exclamation marks before and after the alt text, followed by square brackets with an ID before the image URL. The ID is then defined at the bottom of the page using square brackets followed by a colon and the image URL.

## Advanced Syntax
### Code blocks
#### Inline Code
To add inline code, use backticks (`) before and after the code. For longer code snippets, use backticks before and after the code, separated by a space.

#### Fenced Code Blocks
To create a fenced code block, use three backticks (
