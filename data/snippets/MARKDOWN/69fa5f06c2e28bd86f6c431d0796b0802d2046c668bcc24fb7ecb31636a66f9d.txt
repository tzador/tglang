<!-- This is a code snippet demonstrating the use of nested lists and formatting in Markdown language -->

# Welcome to my Markdown code snippet!

1. First, we need to create a list of programming languages in markdown:

  - Java
  - Python
  - C++
  - Ruby

2. Next, let's create a list of different types of code formatting:

  - *italics*
  - **bold**
  - `code`
  - ~~strikethrough~~
  
3. Now, let's combine these lists into nested lists:

  - Programming Languages:
    - Java
    - Python
    - C++
    - Ruby
  - Code Formatting:
    - *italics*
    - **bold**
    - `code`
    - ~~strikethrough~~

4. We can also add a table to our code snippet:

| Programming Language | Popularity |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| Java                  | High       |
| Python                | High       |
| C++                   | Medium     |
| Ruby                  | Low        |

5. Lastly, let's add in some code syntax highlighting:
