# List of items
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

/// This is a long and complex markdown code snippet that demonstrates how to create a numbered list in markdown. In markdown, a numbered list is created by starting each item with a number followed by a period and a space. This can be seen in the example above, where we have a list of three items. The numbers do not have to be in sequential order, they can also be customized to suit the needs of the writer. Markdown also automatically adds the correct numbers to each item, so the writer does not have to keep track of the numbering manually. In addition, the forward slashes at the beginning of the line are used to denote a comment in markdown code, which is not displayed in the final output.
