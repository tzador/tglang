 > ## 1. Introduction
 >Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to make writing and
 >formatting content for the web as easy as possible. It is widely used by
 >developers, bloggers, and technical writers for creating documentation and
 >blog posts. It is simple to learn and allows you to focus on writing
 >content rather than worrying about complex formatting.
 >
 >## 2. Syntax
 >
 >### Headings
 >Headings in markdown are designated by using one to six pound signs (#), with
 >one being the largest and six being the smallest. For example:
 >
 >`# Heading 1`
 >`## Heading 2`
 >`### Heading 3`
 >
 >### Emphasis
 >Markdown allows you to add emphasis to your text using asterisks (*)
 >or underscores (_). You can use single or double asterisks/underscores
 >depending on how much emphasis you want to add. For example:
 >
 >`*This text will be italic*`
 >`**This text will be bold**`
 >
 >### Lists
 >Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. To create an unordered list,
 >use asterisks (*), plus signs (+), or hyphens (-) before each list item. For example:
 >
 >`* Item 1`
 >`* Item 2`
 >`* Item 3`
 >
 >To create an ordered list, use numbers followed by a period before each list item. For example:
 >
 >`1. Item 1`
 >`2. Item 2`
 >`3. Item 3`
 >
 >### Links
 >You can add links in markdown by using square brackets followed by the link in parentheses.
 >For example:
 >
 >`[Link to Google](https://www.google.com/)`
 >
 >### Images
 >To add images in markdown, use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for the alt text
 >and parentheses for the image URL. For example:
 >
 >`![Alt text](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)`
 >
 >### Code Blocks
 >To add code blocks in markdown, use triple backticks followed by the language name (optional)
 >and the code within the backticks. For example:
 >
