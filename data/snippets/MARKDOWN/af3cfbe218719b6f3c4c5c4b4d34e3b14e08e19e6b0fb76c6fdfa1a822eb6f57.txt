# Table of Contents
### Overview
This is a complex code snippet written in MARKDOWN that aims to demonstrate how to create a table of contents with links using headings and a horizontal rule.
Headings are denoted by adding one or more # symbols before the text, with more # symbols indicating lower-level headings.
For example:
# This is a level one heading
## This is a level two heading
### This is a level three heading
To create a table of contents, first create a heading with a title for the table of contents, such as "Table of Contents" or "Contents".
After that, create another heading with a title for the first section of the document.
Below both headings, use a horizontal rule by typing three or more dashes (-) between empty lines.
For each section of the document, create a heading with a title and add a link to that heading using the title in square brackets and a colon and the hashtag symbol followed by the heading title in parentheses.
For example:
[Section One:](#section-one)
[Section Two:](#section-two)
Once you have created the necessary headings and links, the table of contents will be automatically generated and will allow readers to easily navigate through your document.
Happy coding!
