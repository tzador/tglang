<!--Code for creating a table with headers, rows, and cells in markdown-->

Table Header 1 | Table Header 2 | Table Header 3
--- | --- | ---
Row 1, Cell 1 | Row 1, Cell 2 | Row 1, Cell 3
Row 2, Cell 1 | Row 2, Cell 2 | Row 2, Cell 3

<!--Explanation: This code creates a table with three headers and three rows with three cells each. The "---" indicates the beginning of the table and separates the headers from the rows. Each row is separated by a new line and cells within each row are separated using "|" symbol. This table can be used to organize data in a more visually appealing way and can be especially useful for displaying data in a presentation or report.-->
