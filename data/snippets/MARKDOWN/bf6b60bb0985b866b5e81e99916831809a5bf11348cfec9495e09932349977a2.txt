<!-- This is a complex code snippet in MARKDOWN -->
<!-- First, we declare a variable called 'num' and assign a value of 5 -->
num = 5

<!-- Next, we create a loop that will iterate 10 times -->
for i in range(10):
    <!-- Inside the loop, we check if the current iteration is greater than or equal to 5 -->
    if i >= 5:
        <!-- If it is, we print out the current iteration number and its square -->
        print("The square of " + str(i) + " is " + str(i*i))
    <!-- If the current iteration is less than 5, we print out a message indicating that it is less than 5 -->
    else:
        print("Iteration number " + str(i) + " is less than 5.")
