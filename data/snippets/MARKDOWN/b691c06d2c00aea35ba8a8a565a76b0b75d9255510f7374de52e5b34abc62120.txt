There are many different ways to style text in Markdown. One option is to use
    a combination of asterisks, underscores, and tildes to create bold, italicized, 
    and strikethrough text.

    **Bold** text can be achieved by enclosing the desired text in double asterisks or underscores. For example, `**Bold text**` or `_Bold text_` will both result in bold text. 

    *Italicized* text can be achieved by enclosing the desired text in single asterisks or underscores. For example, `*Italicized text*` or `_Italicized text_` will both result in italicized text.

    ~~Strikethrough~~ text can be achieved by enclosing the desired text in double tildes. For example, `~~Strikethrough text~~` will result in strikethrough text. 

    Markdown also allows for creating headings of various sizes. Headings are created by using one or more hashtags (`#`) before the text you want to turn into a heading. The number of hashtags used will determine the size of the heading, with one hashtag creating the largest heading and six hashtags creating the smallest heading.

    # Heading 1
    ## Heading 2
    ### Heading 3
    #### Heading 4
    ##### Heading 5
    ###### Heading 6

    Ordered and unordered lists can also be created in Markdown by using numbers or dashes, respectively, before each item. Nested lists can also be created by indenting the items with tabs or spaces.

    1. First item
    2. Second item
    3. Third item

    - First item
    - Second item
    - Third item

    - First item
        - Nested item 1
        - Nested item 2
    - Second item
        - Nested item 1
        - Nested item 2

    Lastly, Markdown also allows for creating links and images by using square brackets to enclose the text of the link or alt text of the image, followed by the URL or file path enclosed in parentheses.
