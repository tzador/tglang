> **Some sample text**: "This is just a quick snippet of MARKDOWN code that shows how to create a table."

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
|   data   |   data   |   data   |

The above code snippet creates a simple table with three columns and one row.
It uses the pipe symbol (|) to separate the columns and dashes (-) to create the table's borders.
The table's elements are placed between the pipes, and each new row is created by adding a new line.
To add data to the table, simply replace "data" with the desired information.
