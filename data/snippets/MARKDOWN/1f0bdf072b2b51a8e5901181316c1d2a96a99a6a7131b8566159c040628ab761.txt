- Each subsequent row represents a row in the table and is separated by a new line
- Text within the pipes represents the contents of each cell
- Adding a colon before or after the dashes sets the alignment of the corresponding column
- The first column is left-aligned, the second is center-aligned, and the third is right-aligned
- Images can also be included in cells, just make sure to keep them aligned with the text
