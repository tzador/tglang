# My Tutorial Markdown

Welcome to my tutorial on Markdown!

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It is commonly used for writing documentation, notes, and webpages.

## Basic Formatting

### Headings

Headings in Markdown are denoted by using one to six hash symbols (`#`) at the beginning of a line. The number of hashes indicates the level of the heading, with one being the largest and six being the smallest.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

### Emphasis

*Italic Text* can be achieved by surrounding the text with asterisks or underscores, while **bold text** can be achieved by using two asterisks or underscores.

### Lists

Markdown supports both unordered and ordered lists. Unordered lists can be created by using asterisks, pluses, or hyphens, while ordered lists are created by using numbers followed by a period.

* Item 1
+ Item 2
- Item 3

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Links

Links can be created by using square brackets for the link text, followed by parentheses for the link URL.

### Code Blocks

Code blocks in Markdown can be created by using triple backticks (\`\`\`) at the beginning and end of the code snippet.
