**This is a table in Markdown.** 
* Each row starts and ends with a pipe (|) symbol, and each column is separated by a pipe symbol.
* The first row represents the table header, and all subsequent rows represent table data.
* Use the colon (:) symbol in the header row to specify text alignment. Left-aligned columns have a colon on the left, and right-aligned columns have a colon on the right.
* You can also add a colon to both sides of the column to center align the text.
* Empty cells can be represented with two consecutive pipe symbols.
* The table should be surrounded by three hyphens (-) before and after the table to represent a border.
