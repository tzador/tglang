# Introduction
Welcome to my Markdown document! This is an example of a complex code snippet that showcases various formatting and styling options in Markdown. It includes a title, author, and date, and also uses various YAML options such as a table of contents, floating table of contents, numbered sections, and code folding.

## Heading 1
This is a heading that uses the `#` symbol to create a primary heading in Markdown. You can also add multiple `#` symbols to create subheadings.

### Subheading 1.1
This is a subheading that uses two `#` symbols to create a secondary heading in Markdown. You can continue adding more `#` symbols to create more levels of headings.

## Formatting
You can add bold and italic formatting to text in Markdown. Simply use `**` to add bold and `_` to add italic, like this: **bold** and _italic_.

You can also create lists in Markdown, both ordered and unordered. For ordered lists, use numbers followed by periods, like this:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

For unordered lists, use `*` or `-` before each item, like this:
* First item
* Second item
* Third item

## Links and Images
You can create clickable links and add images in Markdown. To create a link, use `[text](url)`. For images, use `![alt text](image url)`.

Here is an example of a link to [Google](https://www.google.com/) and an image of the Markdown logo:
