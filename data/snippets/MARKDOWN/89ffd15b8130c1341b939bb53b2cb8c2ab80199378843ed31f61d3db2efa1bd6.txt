Markdown offers a variety of formatting options to help you create visually appealing text.

To make text **bold**, wrap it in two asterisks or underscores. Similarly, to make text *italic*, wrap it in one asterisk or underscore.

Markdown has six levels of headings, denoted by the number of hashtags (#) at the beginning of the line. In this code snippet, we are using a level one heading (denoted by one hashtag) for the main title and a level two heading (denoted by two hashtags) for the introduction.

### Lists

You can create both ordered and unordered lists using markdown. For unordered lists, use an asterisk, dash, or plus sign at the beginning of the line. For ordered lists, use numbers followed by a period.
