# Introduction
Welcome to my markdown code snippet! This is a demonstration of how to create a blog post in markdown format.

## Heading
Use `#` for headings. The number of `#` determines the heading level.

### Subheading
You can also use `##` or more `###` for subheadings.

## Styling Text
You can make text **bold** by surrounding it with two asterisks. You can also make it *italic* by using single asterisks.

## Lists
Here's an ordered list:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

And an unordered list:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

## Code
To include code snippets in your markdown, use three backticks followed by the programming language, then end with three backticks.
