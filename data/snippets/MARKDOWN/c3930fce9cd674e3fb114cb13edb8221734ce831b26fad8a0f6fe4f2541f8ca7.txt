# Introduction
This is an example of a complex code snippet in the markdown language. It includes various tags and formatting elements to demonstrate the versatility of markdown.

## Headings
Headings in markdown use the `#` symbol, where the number of `#`s indicates the heading level. This is a level 1 heading.

### Lists
Markdown supports both unordered and ordered lists. This is an unordered list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And this is an ordered list:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

### Links
Links are created using square brackets for the link text, followed by parentheses for the URL. For example, [Google](https://www.google.com/) is a link to the Google website.

### Images
Images can also be added using similar syntax, but with an exclamation mark in front of the square brackets. Like links, images also use parentheses for the image URL. For example: ![Markdown Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg/1920px-Markdown-mark.svg.png)

### Code Blocks
Code can be highlighted using backticks. Language-specific highlighting can also be specified after the first set of backticks. For example, here is a code block in Python:
