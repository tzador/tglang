# Markdown Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of Markdown and how to use it to format our text.

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses a simple syntax to format text. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the goal of making writing and reading text on the web easier. Markdown is commonly used for creating documentation, READMEs, and blog posts.

## Basic Formatting

### Headers
To create headers, you use a number sign (#) followed by a space and the text you want in your header. This corresponds to heading levels 1-6, with one # creating a level 1 heading and six #s creating a level 6 heading.

# Level 1 Header
## Level 2 Header
### Level 3 Header

### Emphasis
To make text bold, surround it with double asterisks (**). To make text italic, surround it with single asterisks (*).

**This text is bold**
*This text is italic*

### Lists
Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. To create an ordered list, use numbers followed by periods. To create an unordered list, use asterisks, dashes, or plus signs.

1. List item 1
2. List item 2

* Unordered list item 1
* Unordered list item 2

### Links
To create a link, use square brackets to surround the linked text, followed by parentheses containing the URL.

[Google](https://www.google.com/)

### Images
To add images, use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets containing alt text, and then parentheses containing the URL.

### Code Blocks
To create a code block, surround your code with three backticks (`) on each side.
