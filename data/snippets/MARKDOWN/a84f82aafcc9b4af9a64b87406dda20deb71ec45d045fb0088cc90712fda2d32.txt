## This is a smaller heading in markdown

Regular text in markdown has no special syntax.

However, you can use *italics* by using a single asterisk on each side of the word or phrase.

For **bold** text, use two asterisks on each side.

1. Numbered lists are easy with markdown.
2. Simply start each item with a number followed by a period and a space.
3. Markdown will automatically number the items for you.

* Bulleted lists can be created by using asterisks for each item.
* This is another item in the bulleted list.
* And this is a third item.

[Link text](https://www.example.com) can be created by using brackets for the link text and parentheses for the URL.

Images can also be added using a similar syntax:

![Alt text](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)

> Blockquotes can be used to highlight important information or quotes.

`Inline code` can be added by using backticks.
