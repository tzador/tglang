## Introduction
Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting and creating documents. It is widely used for writing documentation, notes, and even creating websites. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the help of Aaron Swartz. Markdown is easy to learn and use, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced writers.

## Syntax
Markdown uses simple and intuitive syntax to format text. Here are some examples of basic formatting:

- `*Italic text*` will appear as *Italic text*
- `**Bold text**` will appear as **Bold text**
- `~~Strikethrough text~~` will appear as ~~Strikethrough text~~

You can also create headings using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols will determine the heading level. For example:

- `# Heading 1` will appear as # Heading 1
- `## Heading 2` will appear as ## Heading 2

To create a list, you can use either the `*` or `-` symbol:
