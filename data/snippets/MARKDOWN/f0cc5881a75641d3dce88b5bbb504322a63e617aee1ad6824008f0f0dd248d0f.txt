<!-- Example table -->
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |  <!-- Table header -->
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| row 1, column 1 | row 1, column 2 | row 1, column 3 |  <!-- Table body -->
| row 2, column 1 | row 2, column 2 | row 2, column 3 |
| row 3, column 1 | row 3, column 2 | row 3, column 3 |

To create a table in markdown, use the pipe symbol "|" to separate columns and dashes "-" to create table borders. This example table has 3 columns and 3 rows.

The first row is the header, which contains column titles. Each column title should be separated by a pipe "|".

The second row and beyond are the body, which contain the data for each row and column. Make sure that the number of cells in each row matches the number of columns in the header.

To add more rows, simply add another row of pipe and dashes. To add more columns, add another pipe in the header and add another cell in the corresponding row in the body.

The end result should be a neatly formatted table with a header and body. Remember to enclose the entire table in triple backticks to create a code snippet in markdown.
