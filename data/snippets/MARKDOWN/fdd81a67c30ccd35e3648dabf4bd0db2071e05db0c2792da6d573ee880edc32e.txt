### 1. Markdown and its uses
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is commonly used for formatting and structuring text. It is especially popular in the world of blogging and content creation because of its simplicity and readability. Some common uses for Markdown include:

* Creating headers using the `#` symbol
* Making text **bold** or *italic* using `**` or `*`
* Creating lists with `*` or `-`

Markdown is also highly customizable and can be used to create more complex elements such as tables, code blocks, and images.

| John | 28  | Software Engineer  |
| Sarah | 32   | Graphic Designer |
| Emma | 25  | Writer |
