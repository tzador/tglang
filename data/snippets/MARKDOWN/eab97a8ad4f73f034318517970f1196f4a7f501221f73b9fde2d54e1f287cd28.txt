``LIMITATIONS:

This code snippet was tested in Python 3.8.2, so it may not work in older versions.

DESCRIPTION:

This code snippet allows you to generate a random password with a given length that includes letters, numbers, and special characters. The special characters are taken from the default special characters available in the string module.

The function first creates an array with all the possible characters to be included in the password. Then, using the random module, it selects a random character from the array and appends it to a new password string until the desired length is reached.
