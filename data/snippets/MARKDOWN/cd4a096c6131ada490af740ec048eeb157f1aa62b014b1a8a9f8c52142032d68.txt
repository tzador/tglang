# Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text on the web. This snippet demonstrates how to create a basic article in markdown.

## Heading

Creating headings in markdown is simple, just use `#` symbol followed by a space and the heading text. You can use up to six `#` symbols for different levels of headings.

# This is a level 1 heading
## This is a level 2 heading
### This is a level 3 heading
#### This is a level 4 heading
##### This is a level 5 heading
###### This is a level 6 heading

## Text formatting
You can use markdown syntax to format your text in different ways. For example:
- Use `**` or `__` to bold text: **this text is bold**
- Use `*` or `_` to italicize text: *this text is italicized*
- Use `~~` to strikethrough text: ~~this text is strikethrough~~
- Use `>` to create block quotes:
> This is a block quote
- Use backticks to highlight code: `code snippet`

## Lists
Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. The syntax for creating lists is simple:
- For unordered lists, use `-` or `*` followed by a space:
  - This is a nested list item
  * This is another nested list item
- For ordered lists, use numbers followed by a period and a space:
1. This is a ordered list item
2. This is another ordered list item

## Images and Links
You can also add images and links to your markdown document. The syntax is similar for both:
- For images, use `![alt text](image link)`
