<!-- This is a multi-line comment in markdown -->
# Title of Document

- This is a list item in markdown
- Another list item in markdown

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This is a sample of a long and complex markdown code snippet.

The code snippet above includes a comment, a title, and a bulleted list. To add comments in markdown, use `<!-- comment goes here -->`. To create a title, use `# Title of Document` (the number of hashtags determines the heading size). And to create a bulleted list, use `-` before each list item.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text on the web. It is commonly used for documentation, README files on GitHub, and other platforms. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and can also be easily converted to HTML for formatting.

To learn more about markdown, check out the official documentation or other online resources. Happy coding!
