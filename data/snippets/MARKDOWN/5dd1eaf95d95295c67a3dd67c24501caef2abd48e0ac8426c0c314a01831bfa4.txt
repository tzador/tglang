# Welcome to My Markdown Guide

## Introduction

This is my comprehensive guide to using Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text documents. It is widely used for creating documentation, blogging, and writing plain text notes.

## Headings

To create a heading in Markdown, use the '#' symbol followed by a space and the heading text. Markdown supports up to six levels of headings. For example:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Emphasis

To add emphasis to text in Markdown, use asterisks or underscores around the text. One asterisk or underscore will create *italicized* text, while two will create **bold** text. You can also use three asterisks or underscores for ***bold and italicized*** text.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. To create an unordered list, use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens followed by a space before each item. To create an ordered list, use numbers followed by a period and a space before each item. For example:

* First item
* Second item
* Third item

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links

To add a hyperlink in Markdown, use square brackets around the linked text followed by parentheses around the link URL. You can also add a title for the link after the URL in parentheses. For example:

[Visit my website](https://www.example.com)
[Visit my website](https://www.example.com "My personal website")

## Images

Adding images in Markdown is similar to adding links, but with an exclamation point before the square brackets. Inside the square brackets, add a description for the image, then in parentheses, add the image URL. You can also add a title for the image after the URL in parentheses. For example:

![Logo](https://www.example.com/logo.png "Company logo")

## Code Blocks

To display code snippets in Markdown, use triple backticks before and after the code. You can also specify the language after the first set of backticks for syntax highlighting. For example:
