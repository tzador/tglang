### Welcome to my Markdown Guide!

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to easily format text on the web. It is widely used and supported by many tools such as GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Reddit.

To create headers, use ### followed by a space and your header text.

Lists can be created using either asterisks, dashes, or numbers followed by a space and your list item.

* List item 1
- List item 2
1. Numbered list item 3

Links can be inserted by placing the link text in brackets followed by the link in parentheses.

Images can also be inserted using a similar format, with an exclamation mark before the brackets.

To create emphasis, surround your text with asterisks, underscores, or tilde symbols.
*This text is italicized*
_This text is also italicized_
**This text is bold**
__This text is also bold__
~~This text is strikethrough~~

Code can be displayed using backticks, with the option to specify the programming language for syntax highlighting.
`print("Hello world!")`
