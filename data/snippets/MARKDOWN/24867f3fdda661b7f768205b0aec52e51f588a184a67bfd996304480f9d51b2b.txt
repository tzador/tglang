This code snippet creates a table of contents for a markdown document with four sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Conclusion. Each section is linked to its corresponding heading within the document using anchor links (#introduction, #methods, #results, #conclusion). The table of contents is enclosed in triple backticks (\`\`\`) to indicate a code block in markdown.
