# Sample Markdown Document
 
## Introduction
 
Hello! Welcome to my sample document written in Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting text. It is commonly used for creating documentation, readme files, and online content.
 
## Formatting
 
Markdown allows for easy formatting of text. For example, this document uses single asterisks to make text *italic* and double asterisks to make text **bold**. Backticks can also be used to create `code snippets` within a sentence.
 
## Lists
 
Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. This section includes a bullet point list:
 
- Apples
- Bananas
- Oranges
 
And this section includes a numbered list:
 
1. Red
2. Blue
3. Green
 
## Links
 
Links can be easily created in Markdown using square brackets and parentheses. For example, here's a link to the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org).
