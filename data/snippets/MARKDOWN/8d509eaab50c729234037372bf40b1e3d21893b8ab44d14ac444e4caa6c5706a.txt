# Markdown Table

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |
| Row 3, Col 1 | Row 3, Col 2 | Row 3, Col 3 |

This is an example of a table in markdown. The table has 3 columns and 3 rows, with the first column aligned to the right, and the rest centered. Each row and column is separated by a pipe symbol (|).

To create a table in markdown, we use a combination of pipes (|), dashes (-), and colons (:). The number of dashes in the header should match the number of columns in the table.

The first line contains the column headers, with the alignment specified by adding a colon on either side of the dashes. The second line contains the table divider, with at least 3 dashes for each column. The following lines contain the row data, separated by pipes.

To add text or formatting within a cell, simply type it between the pipes. For example, to make the text bold, you can use asterisks (*) on either side.

This is an example of a table with more complex formatting:

| Name | Age | Occupation |
|:--------|--------:|:----------:|
| **John** | 25 | *Developer* |
| _Maria_ | 30 | **Designer** |
| Ryan | 35 | Researcher |
