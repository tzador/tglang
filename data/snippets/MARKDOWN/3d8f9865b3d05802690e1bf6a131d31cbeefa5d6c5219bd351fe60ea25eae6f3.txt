**Code explanation:**

This is a list of some of my favorite movies, listed in no particular order. Each movie is displayed as a bullet point using the dash symbol (-). To add a new favorite movie, simply add a new line with a dash followed by the movie title. This list can also be customized by adding additional information such as the release year or director's name next to each movie title. The dashed line after the list acts as a visual divider between the list and any other content that follows.
