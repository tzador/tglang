## Headers
Headers are used to create titles and subtitles in a Markdown document. There are six levels of headers, denoted by the number of pound symbols (#) before the text. In Markdown, headers are also used to create table of contents.

# First level header
## Second level header
### Third level header
#### Fourth level header
##### Fifth level header
###### Sixth level header

## Emphasis
Markdown allows for emphasis to be added to text by using asterisks (*) or underscores (_) before and after the text. It can be used to make text appear bold, italicized, or strikethrough.

**Bold text**
*Italicized text*
~~Strikethrough text~~

## Lists
There are two types of lists in Markdown: ordered and unordered. Both types are created by using asterisks (*) or hyphens (-) before the text. Ordered lists are created by using numbers.

* Unordered list item 1
* Unordered list item 2
* Unordered list item 3

1. Ordered list item 1
2. Ordered list item 2
3. Ordered list item 3

## Links
Links can be added to text in Markdown by enclosing the link text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses.

## Images
Images can also be added in Markdown by using an exclamation mark (!) before the link syntax.

To add code snippets in a Markdown document, use triple backticks (\`\`\`) before and after the code.
