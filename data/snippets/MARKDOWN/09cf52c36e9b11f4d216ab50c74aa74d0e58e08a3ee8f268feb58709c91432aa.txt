# Welcome to my Markdown code snippet!

## Markdown Basics

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to easily format text without using HTML tags. 

### Headings
Headings are created using different numbers of `#` symbols. The number of `#` symbols corresponds to the heading level. For example:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

### Lists
Markdown supports ordered and unordered lists. Unordered lists are created using `*`, `-`, or `+` symbols, while ordered lists are created using numbers followed by a period (`1.`, `2.`, etc.). For example:

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 1
  - Sub-item 2
- Item 3

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Emphasis
You can add emphasis to text using `*` or `_` symbols. Surrounding a word with one `*` or `_` will make it *italicized*, surrounding it with two `**` or `__` will make it **bold**, and surrounding it with three `***` or `___` will make it ***bold and italicized***.

### Links
Links can be created using `[link text](url)`. For example: [Google](https://google.com)

### Blockquotes
Blockquotes are created using `>` symbols at the beginning of a line. For example:

> This is a blockquote.

### Code Blocks
To add inline code, wrap the code in single backticks, like this: `code`. For larger blocks of code, use triple backticks.
