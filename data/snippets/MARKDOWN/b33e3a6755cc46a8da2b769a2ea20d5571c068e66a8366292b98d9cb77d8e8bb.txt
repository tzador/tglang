# Markdown Code Snippet

## Paragraphs

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text. It allows you to easily create rich documents with simple syntax. This makes it a popular choice for writing documentation or creating web content.

In Markdown, a paragraph is simply one or more lines of consecutive text. You can create a new paragraph by leaving an empty line between two blocks of text.

## Headers

Headers in Markdown are denoted by the '#' symbol, followed by a space and the header text. There are six levels of headers, with one being the largest and six being the smallest.

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

## Lists

There are two types of lists in Markdown: unordered and ordered. Unordered lists use asterisks, dashes, or plus signs as bullet points, while ordered lists use numbers.

**Unordered List**
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

**Ordered List**
1. First Item
2. Second Item
3. Third Item

## Code Blocks

To insert a code block in Markdown, wrap your code in three backticks (\`\`\`) on the lines above and below the code. This will format the text as a monospaced code block.
