# Data Structure Class
A `Data Structure` class is used to represent common data structures in programming. This class generally contains various methods for manipulating and organizing data.

## Properties
* `name`: the name of the data structure as a string
* `size`: the number of elements in the data structure as an integer

## Methods
* `add(value)`: adds a new element to the data structure
* `remove(index)`: removes the element at the given index from the data structure
* `get(index)`: returns the element at the given index from the data structure
* `search(value)`: searches the data structure for the given value and returns its index if found
* `sort()`: sorts the elements in the data structure in ascending order
* `reverse()`: reverses the order of the elements in the data structure
* `clear()`: removes all elements from the data structure
