## Description:
# This code implements a variation of the game Nim, where two players take turns removing a certain number of objects from a pile. The player who removes the last object wins.

## Global variables:
var pileSize: int # The initial size of the pile
var currentPlayer: int # Keeps track of which player's turn it is
var mode: string # The mode the game is played in (either standard or misere)

## Function to initialize game:
proc initGame(pileSize, mode):
    pileSize = pileSize
    currentPlayer = 0
    mode = mode

## Function to check if game is over:
proc isGameOver():
    if pileSize == 0:
        echo "Game over"
        return true
    else:
        return false

## Function for player to make a move:
proc playerMove(move):
    if mode == "standard":
        pileSize = pileSize - move
    elif mode == "misere":
        pileSize = pileSize + move
    currentPlayer = (currentPlayer + 1) % 2

## Function for computer to generate a move:
proc computerMove():
    var move: int = 0
    if mode == "standard":
        # Find largest power of 2 less than pile size
        var power: int = 0
        while pileSize > 2**power:
            power += 1
        # Remove necessary objects to make pile size a power of 2
        move = pileSize - 2**(power - 1)
        pileSize = pileSize - move
    elif mode == "misere":
        # Find largest power of 2 less than pile size
        var power: int = 0
        while pileSize > 2**power:
            power += 1
        # Remove necessary objects to make pile size a power of 2
        move = 2**(power - 1) - pileSize
        pileSize = pileSize + move
    currentPlayer = (currentPlayer + 1) % 2
    return move

## Main code:
initGame(10, "standard") # Initialize game with 10 objects in the pile
while not isGameOver():
    if currentPlayer == 0:
        # Player's turn
        echo "Player's turn"
        var move: int = readInt() # Player inputs the number of objects to remove
        playerMove(move)
    else:
        # Computer's turn
        echo "Computer's turn"
        var move: int = computerMove()
        echo "Computer removed ", move, " objects."
