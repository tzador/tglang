# This code snippet implements a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
# The factorial function uses recursion and dynamic programming to optimize the calculation time
# Input: Integer representing the number to calculate factorial for
# Output: Integer representing the factorial of the input number

proc factorial(n: int): int =
    var dp: array[1..n,int]
    # Dynamic programming array to store previously calculated values
    dp[1] = 1 # 1! = 1
    for i in 2..n:
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] * i
        # Use previously calculated values to optimize calculation time
    return dp[n]
