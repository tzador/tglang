# This is a NIM code snippet
# It generates a list of prime numbers below a specified limit

var
    primes: array[2..limit] of bool     # array to hold the indication of primes
    i, j: int                           # loop variables

#set all elements in array to true
for i in 2..limit:
    primes[i] = true

# set 1 to false as it is not a prime number
primes[1] = false

#loop through the list
for i in 2..limit:
    if primes[i] == true:
        #set all multiples of current prime number to false
        for j in i * i..limit by i:

#display all prime numbers
for i in 2..limit:
    if primes[i] == true:
