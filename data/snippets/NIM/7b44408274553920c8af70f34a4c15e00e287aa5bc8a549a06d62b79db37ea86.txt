##This is a code snippet in NIM that generates a complex number
var real_part: int = 3 #declare variable for real part of complex number
var imag_part: int = 2 #declare variable for imaginary part of complex number
var complex_num = Complex(real_part,imag_part) #create complex number object
echo "The complex number is ", complex_num.toSring() #print complex number
