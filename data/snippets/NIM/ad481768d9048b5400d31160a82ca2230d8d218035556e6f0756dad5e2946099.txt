# This code snippet creates a custom sequence of numbers using a for loop

# Declare the size of the sequence
var size: int = 10

# Create an empty sequence
var nums: seq[int] = @[]

# Use a for loop to iterate through the sequence and add a number to it
for i in 0..size-1:
  nums.add(i * 2)

# Print out the sequence
echo "The numbers are: "
for num in nums:
  echo " - " & $num
