### This is a code snippet in NIM language
## It prints the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence 

## Creating a function to calculate Fibonacci numbers
proc fib(n: int): int =
    ## Using the recursive formula to calculate Fibonacci numbers
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

## Taking user input for number of terms in the sequence
echo "Enter the number of terms: "
var n = readInt()

## Printing the first n numbers in the sequence
for i in 0..n-1:
    ## Calling the fib function and printing the result
    echo fib(i)
