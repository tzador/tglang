# This is a code snippet in the NIM programming language.
# NIM is a statically typed, imperative programming language with a focus on performance and speed.
# In this snippet, we will create a function called "fibonacci" that will calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

proc fibonacci(n: int): int =
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

echo fibonacci(10) # Output: 55
