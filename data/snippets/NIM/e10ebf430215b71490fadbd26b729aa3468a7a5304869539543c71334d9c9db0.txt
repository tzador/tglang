# This code snippet uses a recursive function to find the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

proc fibonacci(n: int): int =
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

echo fibonacci(10) # prints the 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence, which is 55.
