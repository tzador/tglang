## This is a complex code snippet in NIM

# Define a function to find the maximum of two integers
proc max(x, y: int): int =
    if x > y:
        return x
    else:
        return y
        
# Create a list of numbers
var numbers = [3, 7, 9, 1, 4, 8, 5]

# Use a for loop and the max function to find the largest number in the list
var largest = numbers[0]
for num in numbers:
    largest = max(largest, num)
    
# Print the largest number and its index in the list
echo "The largest number in the list is ", largest, " at index ", numbers.find(largest)
