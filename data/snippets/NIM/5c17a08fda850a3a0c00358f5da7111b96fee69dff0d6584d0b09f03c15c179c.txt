## Nim implementation of a recursive factorial function
# This function takes in an integer n and returns its factorial value

# Define the recursive function with integer argument and int return value
proc factorial(n: int): int =
  if n == 0: # Base case: if n is 0, return 1
    result = 1
  else: # Recursive case: recursively call factorial function and multiply by n
    result = n * factorial(n-1)
  # End of if statement
  result # Return the result

# Main program
echo "Enter a number to find its factorial: "
var num: int = readInt() # Get user input and store in num variable
result = factorial(num) # Call factorial function and store result in result variable
echo "Factorial of ", num, " is ", result # Print the result
