# This code snippet is in the NIM programming language.
# It demonstrates the implementation of a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

proc factorial(n: int): int =
  if n == 0:

  else:
    result = n * factorial(n - 1)

# Here, we call the function for a given number and print the result.
