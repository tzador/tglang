type 
    Person = object 
        name: string
        age: int

# Creating an instance of the custom type
var john = Person(name: "John", age: 30, location: "New York")

# Creating a procedure to display the information about the person
proc displayPerson(p: Person): string =
    result = "[Name: ", p.name, " | Age: ", $p.age, " | Location: ", p.location, "]"

# Displaying the information about the person
echo displayPerson(john)
