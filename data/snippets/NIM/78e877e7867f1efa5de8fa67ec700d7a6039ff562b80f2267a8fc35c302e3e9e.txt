# This is a complex Nim program that sorts a list of numbers using the QuickSort algorithm
# QuickSort is a divide and conquer algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element
# All elements less than the pivot are placed in a "left" list and all elements greater than the pivot are placed in a "right" list
# The process is then repeated recursively on the "left" and "right" lists until the entire list is sorted

# define a function for QuickSort
proc quicksort(data: seq[float]): seq[float] =
    # check if the list contains more than one element
    if len(data) > 1:
        # select the pivot element as the first element of the list
        var pivot = data[0]
        # create an empty "left" list and "right" list
        var left, right: seq[float]

        # loop through the list to compare each element with the pivot
        for i in data[1..^0]:
            # if element is less than the pivot, add it to the "left" list
            if i < pivot:
                left.add(i)
            # if element is greater than the pivot, add it to the "right" list
            else:
                right.add(i)
        
        # recursively apply QuickSort on the "left" and "right" lists and concatenate them with the pivot element in between
        return quicksort(left) & [pivot] & quicksort(right)

    # if the list contains only one element or is empty, return the list as is
    else:
        return data
    
# function call to test the QuickSort implementation
var numbers = [5, 2, 7, 1, 9, 3, 8]
echo quicksort(numbers)

# output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9]
