# This is a NIM code snippet that calculates the factorial of a number

# A function that takes in a number and recursively calculates its factorial
proc factorial(n: int): int =
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# A variable to store the number whose factorial needs to be calculated
var number: int = 5

# Printing the output
echo "Factorial of ", number, " is ", factorial(number)

# Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
