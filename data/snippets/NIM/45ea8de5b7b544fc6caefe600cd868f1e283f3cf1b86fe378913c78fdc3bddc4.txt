# This NIM program takes in two numbers and finds their product

# Define a function to calculate product
proc product(x, y: int): int =
  return x * y

# Take input from user
echo "Enter first number: "
var num1 = readLine(parseInt)
echo "Enter second number: "
var num2 = readLine(parseInt)

# Calculate product
var result = product(num1, num2)

# Print output
echo "The product of ", num1, " and ", num2, " is: ", result
