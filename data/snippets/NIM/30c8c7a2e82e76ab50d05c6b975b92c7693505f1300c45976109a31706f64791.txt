# This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
# Based on an algorithm by Alex Kaschalk

# Define a variable to hold the given number
var inputNumber: int = 10

# Define a variable to hold the previous number in the sequence
var prevNumber: int = 0

# Define a variable to hold the current number in the sequence
var currentNumber: int = 1

# Define a variable to hold the next number in the sequence
var nextNumber: int = 0

# Create an array to hold the sequence numbers
var fibonacciSequence: array[0..inputNumber] of int

# Loop through the sequence up to the given number
for i in 1..inputNumber:

    # Store the current number in the array
    fibonacciSequence[i] = currentNumber

    # Calculate the next number in the sequence
    nextNumber = prevNumber + currentNumber

    # Update the previous and current numbers
    prevNumber = currentNumber
    currentNumber = nextNumber

# Output the array of sequence numbers in a formatted string
echo "The Fibonacci sequence up to " & $inputNumber & " is: "
echo fibonacciSequence.format("[$]")
