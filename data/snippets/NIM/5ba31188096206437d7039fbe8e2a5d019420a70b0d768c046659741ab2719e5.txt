# This code snippet generates a list of numbers in ascending order using a for loop
# The numbers range from 1 to 50 (including both 1 and 50)

# Defining a list variable to store the numbers
var numbers: array[1..50] of int

# Looping through the list and assigning a value to each index
for i in 1..50:
    numbers[i] = i

# Printing the numbers in ascending order
echo "Ascending order: "
for num in numbers:
    echo $num
