# Calculate the sum of the first n numbers recursively

proc sum(n: int): int =
    if n == 0:
        return 0 # base case, sum of first 0 numbers is 0
    else:
        return n + sum(n-1) # recursively add numbers from n-1 to n
 
echo(sum(10)) # output: 55 (sum of first 10 numbers)

# Explanation:
# The proc keyword is used to define a procedure in NIM, which is similar to a function.
# The procedure is named sum and takes in an integer parameter n.
# Inside the procedure, we have an if-statement to check if n is equal to 0, indicating that we have reached the base case.
# If n is 0, the procedure returns 0 as the sum of the first 0 numbers is 0. 
# If n is not 0, the procedure recursively adds n to the sum of the numbers from n-1 to 1. 
# This continues until n reaches the base case of 0, at which point the sum is returned.
# Finally, the echo statement is used to print the output of calling the sum procedure with the input value of 10.
