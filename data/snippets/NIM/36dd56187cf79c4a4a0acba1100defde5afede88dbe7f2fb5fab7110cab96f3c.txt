# This program calculates the BAC (Blood Alcohol Concentration) of a person.

# Declare constants for the average alcohol elimination rate and the legal BAC limit
const AVERAGE_RATE = 0.015

# Declare variables for user input and BAC calculation
var drinkCount: int
var drinkOunces: float
var weightPounds: float

# Get user input for drink count, drink ounces, and weight in pounds
echo "How many drinks have you had?"

readLine(drinkOunces)
echo "What is your weight in pounds?"

# Calculate the total alcohol consumed in ounces
var totalAlcohol: float = drinkCount * (drinkOunces * 0.05)

# Calculate the BAC using the BAC formula
bac = (totalAlcohol * 5.14) / (weightPounds * 0.68) - (AVERAGE_RATE * 5)

# Output the BAC to the user
echo "Your BAC is: ", bac

# Check if the BAC is above the legal limit and output an appropriate message
