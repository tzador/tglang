###This code snippet is a function in NIM that calculates the sum of two numbers and then squares the result###
###The function takes in two input parameters of type `int`
###and returns the squared sum as an output of type `int`

func sumSquare(a: int, b: int): int =
    var sum = a + b  ###Declaring and initializing a variable `sum` as the sum of input parameters###
    var square = sum * sum ###Declaring and initializing a variable `square` as the squared sum###
    result = square ###Assigning the value of `square` to the output variable `result`###
