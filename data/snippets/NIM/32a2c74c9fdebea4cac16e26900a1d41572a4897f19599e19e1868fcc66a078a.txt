# This is a complex code snippet in NIM

# First, we define a custom data type called 'Person'
type Person = object
    name: string
    age: int
    address: string

# We create a new instance of the 'Person' type
var p: Person = Person(name: "John Smith", age: 30, address: "123 Main Street")

# We define a proc (similar to a function) to print out the person's details
proc printPerson(person: Person) =
    echo "Name: ", person.name, ", Age: ", $person.age, ", Address: ", person.address

# Now, we can call the 'printPerson' proc on our person 'p'
printPerson(p)

# We create an array of Persons
var personArray: array[3, Person] = [
    Person(name: "Jane Doe", age: 25, address: "456 Elm Street"),
    Person(name: "Bob Johnson", age: 45, address: "789 Maple Street"),
    Person(name: "Samantha Brown", age: 35, address: "555 Pine Avenue")
]

# We use a for loop to iterate over the array and print each person's details
for person in personArray:
    printPerson(person)

# Finally, we create a dictionary (similar to a map) of Persons
var personDict: Table[string, Person] = {
    "John": Person(name: "John Smith", age: 30, address: "123 Main Street"),
    "Jane": Person(name: "Jane Doe", age: 25, address: "456 Elm Street"),
    "Bob": Person(name: "Bob Johnson", age: 45, address: "789 Maple Street"),
    "Samantha": Person(name: "Samantha Brown", age: 35, address: "555 Pine Avenue")
}

# We can then access a specific person in the dictionary using their name
printPerson(personDict["Bob"])
