#This is a code snippet written in the Nim programming language.
#The snippet demonstrates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

#The `proc` keyword is used to declare a procedure.
#Here, we declare a function called `factorial` that takes in an integer argument `x`.
#The `:` indicates the start of the code block for the function.
proc factorial(x: int): int =

    #The `if` statement checks if the input number is equal to 0.
    #If it is, then the function returns a factorial of 1.
    #This serves as the base case for the factorial calculation.
    if x == 0:
        result = 1
    #If the number is not equal to 0, the function recursively calls itself while decrementing the input number.
    else:
        result = x * factorial(x - 1)

    #The function returns the calculated factorial.
    return result

#We can call the `factorial` function and store the result in a variable.
var calculated_factorial = factorial(5)

#We can then print out the result to the console for viewing.
echo "The factorial of 5 is:", calculated_factorial

"""
Output:
The factorial of 5 is: 120
