## A Nim game class
## This class represents a game of Nim and has methods to play and track the game.

## Define variables for the current players turn and the last player who made a move
var currentPlayer: string
var lastPlayer: string

## Define the starting number of stones in the game
const startingStones = 21

## Set the current player and last player variables to empty strings to start
currentPlayer = ""
lastPlayer = ""

## Define a function to display the current player's turn
proc displayPlayerTurn(currentPlayer: string) =
  echo "It is " & currentPlayer & "'s turn to make a move."

## Define a function to determine if a move is valid
proc isValidMove(stonesToTake: int): bool =
  return stonesToTake > 0 and stonesToTake < startingStones div 2

## Define a function to make a move and update the current and last player variables
proc makeMove(stonesToTake: int) =
  if isValidMove(stonesToTake):
    ## Update the current and last player variables
    lastPlayer = currentPlayer
    if currentPlayer == "Player 1": 
      currentPlayer = "Player 2"
    else:
      currentPlayer = "Player 1"
    ## Update the starting number of stones
    startingStones = startingStones - stonesToTake
    echo lastPlayer & " took " & $stonesToTake & " stones. There are now " & $startingStones & " stones left."
  else:
    echo "Invalid move. Please try again."

## Define a function to check if the game is over
proc isGameOver(): bool =
  return startingStones == 0

## Initialize the game
currentPlayer = "Player 1"
displayPlayerTurn(currentPlayer)

## Loop while the game is not over
while not isGameOver():
  ## Prompt the current player for a move
  echo "How many stones would you like to take?"
  var move = readInt()
  ## Make the move
  makeMove(move)

## Once the game is over, declare the winner
if lastPlayer == "Player 1":
  echo "Player 1 wins!"
else:
  echo "Player 2 wins!"
