# Define a proc (procedure) with a generic type
proc echo[T](input: T): T =
  result = input # assign result to be the input value

# Create a variable with a default value of 10
var myVar: int = 10

# Use the echo proc to print the value of the variable
echo(myVar) # prints 10

# Create a list with multiple types
var myList: seq[Any] = [1, 2.5, "hello"]

# Loop through the list and print each element
for element in myList:
  echo(element) # prints 1, 2.5, and "hello"

# Create a type with properties and methods
type
  Person = object
    name: string
    age: int

# Create a new instance of the Person type
var myPerson: Person = Person(name: "John", age: 30)

# Use dot notation to access and print the properties of the Person instance
echo(myPerson.name) # prints "John"
echo(myPerson.age) # prints 30

# Create a proc that takes in two integers and returns their sum
proc sum(x: int, y: int): int =
  result = x + y # assign result to be the sum of x and y

# Use the sum proc to add two numbers and print the result
echo(sum(5, 10)) # prints 15
