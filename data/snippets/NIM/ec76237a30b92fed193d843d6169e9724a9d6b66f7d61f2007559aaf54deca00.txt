# Define procedure to play Nim
proc play_nim():

  # Define global variables
  global
    pile = 12 # Number of sticks in the pile
    player = 1 # Player number who starts the game
    turn = 1 # Number of turns taken

  # Print instructions
  echo "Welcome to the game of Nim! The goal is to take the last stick from the pile. Each player can take 1, 2, or 3 sticks on their turn."

  # Start game loop
  while true:

    echo "There are " & pile & " sticks left in the pile."

    # Check if all sticks have been taken, end game if true
    if pile == 0:
      echo "Player " & player & " has taken the last stick and wins!"
      break

    # Ask player for input
    echo "Player " & player & ", how many sticks do you want to take? (1-3)"

    # Get player input and convert to integer
    let input = parseInt(readLine(stdin))

    # Check if input is valid
    if input >= 1 and input <= 3:
      pile -= input # Update pile status
      turn += 1 # Update turn number
      player = (player mod 2) + 1 # Change player turn

    # If input is invalid, ask again
    else:
      echo "Invalid input. Please enter a number from 1 to 3."
