# This is a custom object type in NIM called Person, with four fields: name (string), age (integer), salary (float), and married (boolean).

# Define a proc (procedure) called "createPerson" with parameters for the person's name, age, salary, and marital status:
proc createPerson(name: string, age: int, salary: float, married: bool): Person =
    var newPerson = Person()
    newPerson.name = name
    newPerson.age = age
    newPerson.salary = salary
    newPerson.married = married
    result = newPerson # result is a reserved keyword in NIM that indicates the value to be returned by the proc

# Define a proc called "displayPerson" that takes in a Person object as its parameter and prints out their information:
proc displayPerson(person: Person) =
    echo "Name: ", person.name
    echo "Age: ", $person.age # the $ symbol converts the integer value to a string for printing
    echo "Salary: $", person.salary
    if person.married:
        echo "Married: Yes"
    else:
        echo "Married: No"

# Create a new Person object named "John" using the createPerson proc:
var John = createPerson("John", 35, 50000.50, true)

# Display John's information using the displayPerson proc:
displayPerson(John)

# Output:
# Name: John
# Age: 35
# Salary: $50000.50
# Married: Yes
