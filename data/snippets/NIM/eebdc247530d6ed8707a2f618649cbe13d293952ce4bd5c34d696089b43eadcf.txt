#This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number. 
#It utilizes a recursive function and loop to perform the calculation.

proc factorial(n: int): int =
    #define a recursive function to calculate the factorial
    if n <= 1: 
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
        
for i in 1..10:
    #loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10
    echo "Factorial of ", i, " is ", factorial(i)
    #print the result using the recursive function
    
#Output:
#Factorial of 1 is 1
#Factorial of 2 is 2
#Factorial of 3 is 6
#Factorial of 4 is 24
#Factorial of 5 is 120
#Factorial of 6 is 720
#Factorial of 7 is 5040
#Factorial of 8 is 40320
#Factorial of 9 is 362880
#Factorial of 10 is 3628800
