# This is a program that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion in Nim

# Defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number
func factorial(n: int): int =
    if n == 0:
        # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive case: factorial of n is n * factorial(n-1)
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Prompts user to enter a number
echo "Enter a number: "

# Reads user input and converts it to an integer
var num = readLine(parseInt)

# Calls the factorial function with the user input
var result = factorial(num)

# Prints the result
echo "Factorial of ", num, " is ", result
