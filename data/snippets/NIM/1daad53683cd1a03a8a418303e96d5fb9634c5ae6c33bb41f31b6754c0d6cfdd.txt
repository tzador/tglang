# This is a function that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list
# Parameters:
#   - numbers: sequence[int] - a list of integers
# Returns:
#   - int - the sum of all even numbers in the list
proc sumOfEvens(numbers: seq[int]): int =
    var sum = 0 # initialize sum variable to 0
    for num in numbers: # loop through each number in the list
        if num mod 2 == 0: # check if number is even
            sum += num # add number to sum variable
    return sum # return final sum of even numbers
