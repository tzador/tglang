# Defining a procedure called "fibonacci" that takes in a parameter "n"
proc fibonacci(n: int): int =
    # if n is less than or equal to 1, return n
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        # otherwise, use recursion to calculate the Fibonacci sequence
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Declaring a variable "num" and assigning a value to it
var num: int = 6

# Calling the "fibonacci" procedure with the value of "num" as an argument
echo "The Fibonacci number of n = " & $num & " is: " & $fibonacci(num)

# Output:
The Fibonacci number of n = 6 is: 8
