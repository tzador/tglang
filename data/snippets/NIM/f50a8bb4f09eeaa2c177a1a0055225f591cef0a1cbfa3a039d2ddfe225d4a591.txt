# This is a code snippet in NIM that calculates the factorial of a number
# using a recursive function and prints the result

# Define a recursive function to calculate factorial
proc factorial(n: int): int =
  if n == 1 or n == 0:
    result = 1
  else:
    result = n * factorial(n-1)

# Get input from user
var num: int = int.parse(readLine(stdin))

# Call the factorial function and store the result in a variable
var result: int = factorial(num)

# Print the result to the console
echo "The factorial of ", num, " is ", result

# Output:
# The factorial of <input number> is <factorial result>
