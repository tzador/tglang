# The 'shuffleDeck' procedure shuffles a deck of cards given as an array
# of strings and returns the shuffled deck as an array.
proc shuffleDeck(deck: array[string]): array[string] =

  # Create a new random number generator
  var rng = newRandom()

  # Loop through the deck and randomly select a card to add to the shuffled deck
  for i in 0 ..< deck.len:

    var randomIndex = uniform(0, i + 1)

    # Add the randomly selected card to the shuffled deck

    # Swap the randomly selected card with the last card in the deck

# Example
var deck = ["Ace of Hearts", "King of Diamonds", "Queen of Spades", "Jack of Clubs"]
var shuffledDeck = shuffleDeck(deck)
echo shuffledDeck # output: [Jack of Clubs, Ace of Hearts, Queen of Spades, King of Diamonds]
