# This code snippet uses the Nim programming language.
# The following code creates a function that checks if a given number is a prime number.

proc isPrime(num: int): bool =
  var count = 0
  # loop through numbers from 2 to the given number
  for i in 2 .. num:
    if num mod i == 0:
      # if remainder is 0, increase count
      count += 1
  # if count is equal to 1, the number is prime
  return count == 1
  
# Sample usage of the function
echo isPrime(17)  # Output: true
echo isPrime(21)  # Output: false
