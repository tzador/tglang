# This code calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n
# Input: n - integer representing the maximum number
# Output: p - integer representing the sum of all even numbers

proc calculateSum(n: int): int =
  var p: int = 0 # initialize p to 0
  for i in 1..n:  # loop from 1 to n
    if i mod 2 == 0:    # check if current number is even (remainder of 0 when divided by 2)
      p += i    # add current number to p
  return p    # return sum p

echo calculateSum(10)  # output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30)
