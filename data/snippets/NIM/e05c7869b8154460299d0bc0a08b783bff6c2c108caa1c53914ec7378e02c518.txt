## This is a code snippet in NIM that shows how to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

# Function to calculate factorial recursively
proc factorial(n: int): int =
  # Check base case
  if n <= 1:
    return 1
  else:
    # Recursive call to factorial function
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Main program
var number: int

# Get input from user
echo "Enter a number to calculate its factorial:"
read number

# Call factorial function and print result
echo "Factorial of " & $number & " is: "
echo factorial(number)
