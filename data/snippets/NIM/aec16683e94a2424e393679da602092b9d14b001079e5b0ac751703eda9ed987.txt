# This code snippet uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number.
proc factorial(n: int): int =
  if n == 0: # base case, factorial of 0 is 1
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n-1) # recursive call, multiplying current number with factorial of previous number
  
echo factorial(5) # prints the factorial of 5, which is 120
