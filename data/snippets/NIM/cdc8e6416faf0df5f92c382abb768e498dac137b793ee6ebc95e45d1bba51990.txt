# Definition of a procedure to calculate the factorial of a given number
# This procedure takes in a parameter 'n' of type int and returns its factorial
proc factorial(n: int): int =
  # Initialize the result variable to 1
  var result: int = 1

  # Loop through all numbers till n
  for i in 1..n:
    # Multiply the result by the current number
    result = result * i

  # Return the final result
  return result

# Call the factorial procedure and print the result
