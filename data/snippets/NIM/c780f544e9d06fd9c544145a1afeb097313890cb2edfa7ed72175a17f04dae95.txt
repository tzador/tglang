# This is a program that utilizes recursion to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
# Define a procedure to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion
proc fib(n: int): int =
    if n < 1:
        # Base case, return 0 for n = 0 and 1 for n = 1
        return n

        # Recursive case, call fib function for n-1 and n-2 and add them together
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

# Get input from user for the nth Fibonacci number to calculate
echo "Enter a positive integer: "
var num: int = parse(stdin.readLine())

# Call the fib procedure and store the result in a variable
var result: int = fib(num)

# Print the result to the user
echo "The nth Fibonacci number is: ", result

# Output:
# Enter a positive integer:
# 6
# The nth Fibonacci number is: 8
