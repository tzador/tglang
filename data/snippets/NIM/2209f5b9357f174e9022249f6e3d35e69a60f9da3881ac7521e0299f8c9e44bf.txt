# Nim is a programming language that focuses on speed, efficiency, and expressiveness.

# Define a class called "Product"
type
    Product = object
        name: string
        price: float
        quantity: int
        description: string

# Create an instance of the class and assign values to its properties
var product: Product = Product(
    name: "Nim Programming Book", 
    price: 30.50,
    quantity: 10,
    description: "A comprehensive guide to mastering the Nim programming language."
)

# Create a new variable "total_price" and calculate the total price of the product
var total_price: float = product.price * product.quantity

# Print out the details of the product using string interpolation in Nim
echo "Product Name: $(product.name)"
echo "Product Price: $$(product.price)"
echo "Product Quantity: $$(product.quantity)"
echo "Product Description: $(product.description)"

# Print out the total price of the product
echo "Total Price: $$(total_price)"

# Define a new procedure "update_quantity" that takes in a Product object and updates its quantity
proc update_quantity(product: Product) =
    product.quantity += 5

# Call the "update_quantity" procedure on the product instance
update_quantity(product)

# Print out the updated quantity of the product
echo "Updated Quantity: $$(product.quantity)"
