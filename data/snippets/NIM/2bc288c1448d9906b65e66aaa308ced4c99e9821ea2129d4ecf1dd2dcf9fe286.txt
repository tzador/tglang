## This is a game of NIM
## The rules are:
## 1. A starting number of sticks is set
## 2. Players can take 1, 2 or 3 sticks from the pile on their turn
## 3. The player who takes the last stick loses
## This code snippet creates a function that runs the NIM game

# Defining the function to play the game
proc playNIM(starting_sticks: int) =

    # Setting up the initial game state
    var current_sticks: int = starting_sticks
    var player_turn: int = 1

    # Main game loop
    while true:

        # Displaying the current game state
        echo "There are ", current_sticks, " sticks remaining"
        echo "Player ", player_turn, " turn"

        # Asking for user input
        var chosen_sticks: int = inputInt("How many sticks do you want to take? (1/2/3)")

        # Validating user input
        if chosen_sticks < 1 or chosen_sticks > 3 or chosen_sticks > current_sticks:
            echo "Invalid input, please select 1, 2 or 3 sticks"
            continue

        # Updating the game state with user's move
        current_sticks -= chosen_sticks

        # Checking if the game is over
        if current_sticks == 0:
            echo "Player ", player_turn, " loses!"
            break

        # Switching player turn
        if player_turn == 1:
            player_turn = 2
        else:
            player_turn = 1

# Starting the game with 10 sticks
