#This program finds the average of ten numbers using NIM programming language.

# Create an array of size 10 to store the numbers
var numbers: array[10, float]

#Use a for loop to get user input and store in the array
for i in 0..<10:
    echo "Enter number #$(i + 1): "
    let num = parseFloat(stdin.readLine())
    numbers[i] = num

#Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the array
var sum: float
for i in 0..<10:
    sum += numbers[i]

#Calculate the average
var average: float = sum / 10

#Output the average to the user
echo "The average is $(average)"

#If the average is above 50, print "Above average", else print "Below average"
if average > 50:
    echo "Above average"
else:
    echo "Below average"
