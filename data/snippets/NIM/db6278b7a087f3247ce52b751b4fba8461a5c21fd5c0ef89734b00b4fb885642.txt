# This code snippet creates a game of Nim with customizable settings
# First, we initiate our variables that will hold the game settings and results
var num_piles: int # number of piles in the game
var max_stones: int # maximum number of stones in each pile
var players: seq[string] # list of players in the game
var turn: string # current turn of player
var winner: string # winner of the game

# Next, we prompt the user to enter the game settings

echo "What is the maximum number of stones in each pile?"
readLine(max_stones)

# Then, we print the initial state of the game with the number of piles and maximum number of stones
echo "--------------------------------------------"
echo "Game Settings:"

# Next, we create a loop to initialize the piles with random number of stones
for i in 0..num_piles-1:
  piles.add(rand(max_stones)+1)

# Then, we randomly select the first player to start the game
turn = players[rand(players.len)]

# Next, we start the game loop until all the stones in the piles are taken
while piles.sum > 0:
