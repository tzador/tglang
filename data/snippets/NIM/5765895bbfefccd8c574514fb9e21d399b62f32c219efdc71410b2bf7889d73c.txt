When we want to create a new type of data, we can use the `type` keyword to define it.

type
    Person = object
        name: string
        age: int
        address: string

This creates a new type called `Person` which has three fields: `name`, `age`, and `address`. We use the `object` keyword to indicate that this is an object type. 

Now, let's create a `proc` (procedure) that will print out a message using the data from our `Person` type.

proc printPerson(person: Person) =
    echo "Name: ", person.name
    echo "Age: ", person.age
    echo "Address: ", person.address

To use our new `Person` type and `printPerson` procedure, we first need to create an instance of the `Person` type.

var john: Person = Person(name: "John", age: 30, address: "123 Main Street")

This creates a new variable called `john` of type `Person` and initializes its three fields with the values provided.

We can now call our `printPerson` procedure and pass `john` as an argument.

printPerson(john)

This will output the following:
