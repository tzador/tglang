## Fibonacci Sequence Generator
# Program to generate the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence

# Define a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence
func fibonacci(n: int): seq[int] =
    var fib_sequence = newSeq[int]  # create a new sequence to store the Fibonacci terms
    for i in 0..n-1:
        if i <= 1:
            # first two terms of the sequence are 0 and 1
            fib_sequence.add(i)
        else:
            # every term after the first two is the sum of the previous two terms
            fib_sequence.add(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])
    return fib_sequence

# Define a variable to store the number of terms to generate
var n = 10

# Call the function to generate the first n terms of the sequence
var sequence = fibonacci(n)

# Print the generated sequence
