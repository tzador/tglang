# This code snippet generates a random password of 12 characters using the `rand` function from the `os` module.

# Import the `os` module.
import os

# Define the characters to be used in the password.
var characters: string = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%&?_"

# Initialize an empty string to store the generated password.
var password: string = ""

# Loop through 12 times to generate 12 characters for the password.
for i in 0..11:
    # Use the `rand` function from the `os` module to generate a random number between 0 and the length of `characters`.
    var rand_num = rand(len(characters))
    # Use the `[]` indexing operator to access a random character from `characters` using the `rand_num`.
    var char = characters[rand_num]
    # Concatenate the randomly chosen character to the `password` string.
    password = password & char

# Output the generated password.
