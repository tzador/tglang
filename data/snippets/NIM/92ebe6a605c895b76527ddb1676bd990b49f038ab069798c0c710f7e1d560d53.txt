# This code calculates the exponent of a number using recursion

# Declaring a function with a base number and exponent as parameters
proc exp(base: int, exponent: int): int =
    if exponent == 0: # base case
        result = 1
    else:
        # Recursive call, multiplying base with exponent
        result = base * exp(base, exponent - 1)

# Calling the function with base = 10 and exponent = 5
echo "10 to the power of 5 is ", exp(10, 5) # Output: 10 to the power of 5 is 100000
