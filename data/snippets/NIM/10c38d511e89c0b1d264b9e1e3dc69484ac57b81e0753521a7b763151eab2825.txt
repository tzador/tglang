# This is a comment line.
# This code snippet uses the NIM programming language, which is a language similar to Python.

var x:int = 5
var y:float = 3.14
var stringVariable:string = "Hello World"

# This is a block comment.
# This code snippet also uses the NIM standard library functions, such as calculating the square root of x.

var square_root:float = math.sqrt(x)

# This code snippet also demonstrates the use of conditionals and loops in NIM.

if x > 0:
    for i in range(x):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            echo "Even Number"
        else:
            echo "Odd Number"

# This code snippet also shows how to work with files in NIM.

var file:File = open("test.txt", "w")
if file != nil:
    file.write(stringVariable)
    file.close()

# This is the end of the code snippet.
