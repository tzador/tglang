# This is a function in NIM that calculates the factorial of a given number

proc factorial(num: int): int =
  var result = 1 # initialize the result variable to 1
  for i in 1..num: # loop from 1 to the given number
    result = result * i # multiply the current result with the current number
  return result # return the final result of the factorial

echo factorial(5) # prints the factorial of 5, which is 120
