# NIM Programming Language
# This code snippet generates a random list of numbers and calculates its average
# Importing the random module
import random
# Setting the range of numbers
let minValue = 1
let maxValue = 10
# Generating 10 random numbers and storing them in a list
var numbers: array[10, int]
for i in 0..10:
    numbers[i] = random(low=minValue, high=maxValue)
# Calculating the sum of all numbers in the list
var sum = 0
for num in numbers:
    sum += num
# Calculating the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list
var average = sum / len(numbers)
# Printing the list of numbers
echo "Generated list of numbers: ", numbers
# Printing the average
echo "Average of the list of numbers: ", average
