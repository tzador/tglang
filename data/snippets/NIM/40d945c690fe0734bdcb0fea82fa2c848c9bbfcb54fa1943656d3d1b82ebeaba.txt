# This code snippet calculates the sum of two numbers using the add operator. 

# Defining a proc takes two float numbers as parameters 
proc add(x, y: float): float =
    result = x + y       # Adding the two numbers and storing the sum in a variable called 'result'
    return result       # Returning the sum as the output of the proc 

# Taking user input for the two numbers 
echo "Enter the first number: "
var num1 = readFloat()

echo "Enter the second number: "
var num2 = readFloat()

# Calling the add proc with user input as arguments 
var sum = add(num1, num2)

# Displaying the sum to the user 
echo "The sum of" & $num1 & " and " & $num2 & " is " & $sum
