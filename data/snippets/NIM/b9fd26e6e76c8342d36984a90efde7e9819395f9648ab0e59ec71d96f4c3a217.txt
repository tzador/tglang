## This is a code snippet for computing the nth Fibonacci number in NIM
proc fib[N: int]: int =                        ## Declare a procedure that takes in an integer as input and returns an integer
    var a, b, c: int                           ## Declare three variables of type int
    if N < 2:                                  ## If statement to check if N is less than 2
        result = N                             ## If N is less than 2, set result to N
    else:                                      ## Else statement if N is equal to or greater than 2
        a = 0                                   ## Set a to 0
        b = 1                                   ## Set b to 1
        result = 1                              ## Set result to 1
        for i in 2..N:                          ## For loop to iterate from 2 to N
            c = a + b                           ## Calculate the next Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers
            a = b                               ## Move a to b
            b = c                               ## Move b to c
            result = c                          ## Set result to c, which is the current Fibonacci number
    result                                      ## Return the result
