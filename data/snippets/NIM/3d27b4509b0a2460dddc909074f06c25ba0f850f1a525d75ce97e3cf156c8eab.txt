# This code snippet creates a function that checks if a given number is prime or not

proc isPrime(num: int): bool =
    # Check if number is equal to 2, which is the first prime number
    if num == 2: return true
    # Check if number is less than 2 or even, which means it is not prime
    elif num < 2 or num mod 2 == 0: return false
    
    # Loop through odd numbers starting from 3, up to the square root of the given number
    for i in 3..int(sqrt(num)+1) by 2:
        # Check if the given number is divisible by any odd number
        if num mod i == 0: return false
    
    # If no factors are found, the number is prime
    return true

# Define an example variable to test the function
var num = 17

# Call the isPrime function and print the result
echo isPrime(num)

# Output: true
