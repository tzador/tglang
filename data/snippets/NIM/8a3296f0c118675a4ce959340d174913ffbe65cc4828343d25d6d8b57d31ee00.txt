### This is a code snippet in NIM

# This is a simple NIM program that finds the factorial of a given number

# Define a function to find the factorial
proc factorial(num: int): int =
    # Check for base case
    if num == 0:
        result = 1
    else:
        # Use recursion to find factorial
        result = num * factorial(num - 1)

    return result

# Take user input
echo "Enter a number: "
var number = readInt()

# Call the factorial function and store the result
var result = factorial(number)

# Print the result
echo "The factorial of ", number, " is ", result

### The expected output should look something like this:
"Enter a number: "
10
"The factorial of 10 is 3628800"
