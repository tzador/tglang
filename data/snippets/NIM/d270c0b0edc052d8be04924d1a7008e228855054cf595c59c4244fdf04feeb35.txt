# This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the average of the numbers.
# It uses a for loop and if statement to check for invalid inputs and calculates the average.
proc calculateAverage(numbers: seq[int]): float =
    var total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num < 0:
            echo "Invalid input!"
            return 0.0
        total += num

# This is an example of calling the function with a list of numbers.
# Note: The function must be called after it has been defined.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let avg = calculateAverage(numbers)
echo "The average of ", numbers, " is ", avg # Output: The average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 3.0
