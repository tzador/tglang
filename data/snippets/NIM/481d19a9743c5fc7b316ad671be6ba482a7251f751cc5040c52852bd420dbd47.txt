# Nim is a cross-platform, statically typed, imperative programming language.

# Variables can be declared using var, let, and const keywords.
var firstName: string = "John"
let age: int = 25
const isEmployee: bool = true

# Control flow statements:
if age < 18:
    echo "You're not an adult"
elif age < 65:
    echo "You're an adult but not yet a senior citizen"
else:
    echo "You're a senior citizen"

# Looping through a range of numbers:
for i in 0..10:
    echo i
# Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

# Arrays can be declared using square brackets:
var fruits: array[string] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Procedure that takes in parameters:
proc greet(name: string) =
    echo "Hello, " & name

# Calling the procedure:
greet(firstName)
# Output: "Hello, John"
