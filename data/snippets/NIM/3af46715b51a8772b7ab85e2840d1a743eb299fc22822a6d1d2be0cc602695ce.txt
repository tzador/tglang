# A sample NIM program that calculates the factorial of a given number
proc factorial(num: int): int =
    # declare a variable to store the result
    var result: int = 1

    # use a for loop to multiply the numbers from 1 to num
    for i in 1..num:
        result = result * i
    
    # return the final result
    result

# call the factorial function with an input of 5 and print the result
echo factorial(5)

# output: 120
