#This is a complex code snippet in the NIM programming language

#Define a type called "person"
type
  person = object:
    name: string
    age: int
    occupation: string

#Create a procedure to display a person's information
proc displayPerson(person: person) =
  echo "Name: ", person.name
  echo "Age: ", person.age
  echo "Occupation: ", person.occupation

#Create a sequence of persons
var persons: seq[person]
persons.add(person(name: "John", age: 27, occupation: "Software Engineer"))
persons.add(person(name: "Emily", age: 32, occupation: "Data Analyst"))
persons.add(person(name: "Michael", age: 24, occupation: "Graphic Designer"))

#Sort the sequence by age in ascending order
sort(persons, proc(a, b) => a.age < b.age)

#Loop through the sequence and call the displayPerson procedure
for person in persons:
  displayPerson(person)

#Output:
Name: Michael
