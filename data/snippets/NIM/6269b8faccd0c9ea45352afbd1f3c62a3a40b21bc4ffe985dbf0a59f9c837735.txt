### This code calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion ###
### The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number ###

proc factorial(n: int): int =
    if n == 0:         # base case
        result = 1     # if input is 0, the factorial is 1
    else:              # recursive case
        result = n * factorial(n - 1)    # multiply current number with factorial of n-1
    return result

var x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = factorial(x)
echo("The factorial of ", x, " is ", result)

'''
Sample Output:
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120
