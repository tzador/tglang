# This is a complex code snippet in the NIM programming language.

# First, we declare a multi-dimensional array with 3 dimensions
var array: array[3,3,3] of int 

# This for loop will iterate through the first dimension of the array
for i in 0..2: 
    # This for loop will iterate through the second dimension of the array 
    for j in 0..2: 
        # This for loop will iterate through the third dimension of the array 
        for k in 0..2:
            # We assign a random integer between 1 and 10 to each element in the array 
            array[i,j,k] = rand(1..10)
            
# This function takes in the array and prints out the sum of all elements in the array
proc printSum(arr: array[3,3,3])=
    var sum = 0 
    # This for loop iterates through all dimensions of the array 
    for i in 0..2:
        for j in 0..2:
            for k in 0..2:
                # We add each element to the sum variable 
                sum += arr[i,j,k]
    # Finally, we print out the sum 
    echo "The sum of all elements in the array is: ", sum 

# We call the printSum function with our randomly generated array 
printSum(array)

# Output: The sum of all elements in the array is: 135
