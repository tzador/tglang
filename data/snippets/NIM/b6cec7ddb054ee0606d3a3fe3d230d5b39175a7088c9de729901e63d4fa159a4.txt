## Examples:
## 
## - How to initialize an empty sequence with '0':
var mySeq: seq[int] = @[]

# - How to create a sequence with initial values:
var mySeq2: seq[string] = @["Hello", "World"]

# - How to access elements in a sequence:
echo mySeq2[0]  # Output: "Hello"

# - How to add new elements to a sequence:
mySeq.add(1)
echo mySeq  # Output: [1]
 
# - How to insert elements at specific index in a sequence:
mySeq.insert(0, 2)
echo mySeq  # Output: [2, 1]

# - How to remove elements from a sequence:
mySeq.removeAt(1)
echo mySeq  # Output: [2]

# - How to check if a sequence contains a element:
if "Hello" in mySeq2:
  echo "Sequence contains 'Hello'."  # Output: "Sequence contains 'Hello'."
else:
  echo "Sequence does not contain 'Hello'."

# - How to sort a sequence in ascending order:
mySeq.sort()
echo mySeq  # Output: [1, 2]

# - How to iterate through a sequence:
for elem in mySeq:
  echo elem  # Output: 1 2
