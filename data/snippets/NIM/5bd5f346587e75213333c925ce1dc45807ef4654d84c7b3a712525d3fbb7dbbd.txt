## This is a NIM code snippet for generating random numbers
# Import the random module
import random
 
# Define the number of random numbers to generate
num_of_numbers = 10
 
# Define the maximum possible value for the random numbers
max_val = 100
 
# Initialize an empty array to store the generated numbers
var arr: seq[int] = newSeq [num_of_numbers]
 
# Loop through the array and generate random numbers within the designated range
for i in 0 ..< num_of_numbers:
    arr[i] = random.randint(1, max_val)
 
# Print the array of random numbers
echo "Generated random numbers: ", arr
 
# Sort the array in ascending order
arr.sort()
 
# Print the sorted array
echo "Sorted numbers: ", arr
 
# Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the array
var sum: int = 0
for i in 0 ..< num_of_numbers:
    sum += arr[i]
 
# Print the sum of the numbers
echo "Sum of all numbers: ", sum
 
# Calculate the average of the numbers
var avg: float = sum / num_of_numbers
 
# Print the average
echo "Average of numbers: ", avg
