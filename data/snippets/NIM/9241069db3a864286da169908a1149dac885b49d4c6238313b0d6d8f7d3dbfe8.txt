# This program iterates through a list of numbers and
# prints out the sum of the even numbers in the list.

# Define a list of numbers
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Define a variable to store the sum
var sum = 0

# Use a for loop to iterate through the list
for number in numbers:
    # Check if the number is even
    if number mod 2 == 0:
        # Add the number to the sum
        sum += number

# Print out the sum
echo "The sum of even numbers is: " & sum
