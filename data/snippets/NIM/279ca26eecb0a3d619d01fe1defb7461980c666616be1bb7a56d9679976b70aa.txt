# This is a code snippet in NIM

# This is a simple example of a function in NIM that calculates the square of a given number

# Define the function with the 'proc' keyword and give it a name, in this case 'square'
# Include a parameter, 'x', which is an integer
# Indentation is important in NIM, so we use four spaces for each line
# Use the 'return' keyword to specify the output of the function
proc square(x: int): int =
    return x * x

# Create a variable to store the input number
var number: int = 5

# Print a message to the user
echo "Calculating the square of", number, "..."

# Use the function and pass the number variable as the input
var result = square(number)

# Print the result
echo "The square of", number, "is", result

# Output:
#
# Calculating the square of 5...
# The square of 5 is 25
