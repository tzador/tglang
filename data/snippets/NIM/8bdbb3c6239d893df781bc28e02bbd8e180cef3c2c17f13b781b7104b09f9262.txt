#A simple program to calculate and print the square root of a number

#Importing the math library for access to its square root function
import math

#Creating a constant variable for the maximum number of iterations
const MAX_ITERATIONS = 100

#Function to calculate the square root of a number using the Newton's method
proc newton_square_root(num: float): float =
    var x = num #Initial guess for square root
    var i = 0 #Variable for iteration count

    #Loop until desired accuracy is achieved or maximum iterations are reached
    while i < MAX_ITERATIONS:
        
        #Calculating the derivative of the current guess
        var derivative = (2 * x) / num

        #Using Newton's method to calculate a new guess for the square root
        x = x - ((math.square(x) - num) / derivative)

        #Increasing the iteration count by 1
        i += 1

    #Returning the final calculated square root
    return x

#Taking user input for the number to calculate the square root of
echo "Enter a number:"
var num = parseFloat(stdin.readLine())

#Calling the newton_square_root function and storing the result in a variable
var square_root = newton_square_root(num)

#Printing the result to the console
echo "The square root of" & num & "is" & square_root 

#Example input: 9
#Example output: The square root of 9 is 3
