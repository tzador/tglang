# This is a code snippet in NIM
# It defines a procedure that calculates the Factorial of a given number
proc factorial(n: int): int =
  ## Recursive function that calculates the factorial of n.
  if n <= 1:
    return 1
  else:
    result = factorial(n-1)
    return result * n

# Main function that calls the factorial procedure
proc main() =
  var num = 5 # Change this value to test different inputs
  echo "Factorial of ", num, " is: ", factorial(num)

main()

# Output:
# Factorial of 5 is: 120
