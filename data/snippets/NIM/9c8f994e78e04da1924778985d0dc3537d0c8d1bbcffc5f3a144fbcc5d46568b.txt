## This is a code snippet in NIM to calculate the factorial of a number.

proc factorial(num: int): int =
    ## This is a recursive procedure that calculates the factorial
    ## of a given number.

    if num == 0:
        ## Base case, factorial of 0 is 1.
        return 1
    elif num < 0:
        ## Error case, factorial of a negative number is not defined.
        raise newException(ValueError, "Factorial of negative number is undefined.")
    else:
        ## Recursive case, calculates factorial using num * (num - 1).
        return num * factorial(num - 1)

echo factorial(5) ## Outputs 120, the factorial of 5.
