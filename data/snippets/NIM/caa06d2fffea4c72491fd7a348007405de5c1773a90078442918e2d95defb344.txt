## A program to calculate the Fibonacci sequence

# Define the starting terms of the sequence
var n0 = 0
var n1 = 1

# Define the maximum number of terms to be calculated
var max_terms = 10

# Print the starting terms
echo n0
echo n1

# Loop through the remaining terms
for i in 2..max_terms:
  # Calculate the next term in the sequence
  var next_term = n0 + n1

  # Print the next term
  echo next_term

  # Reassign n0 and n1 to prepare for the next iteration
  n0 = n1
  n1 = next_term
