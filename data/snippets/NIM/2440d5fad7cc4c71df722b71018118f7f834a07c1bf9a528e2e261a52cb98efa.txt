pytest code snippet with written explanationsP
In this code snippet, we have declared several custom data types in the NIM programming language. These include a `Person` type with `name` and `age` fields, an `enum` `Message` type with `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `ERROR` values, a generic `Book` type which takes in a `string` as its type parameter, a `Sequence` type with a `len` field and a `data` array, an `AVLTree` type which is a self-balancing binary search tree, and an `MyObject` type which is a subtype of `Root`. 

We have also declared several variables of these types - `person`, `book`, `sequence`, `avlTree`, and `myObject`.

The code also includes several procedures, such as `initializePerson` which takes in a `Person` type and sets its `name` and `age` fields, and `createBook` which creates and returns a `Book` type with the given `title`, `author`, and `year`. We also have an `insertMessage` procedure which takes in an `AVLTree` and inserts a new node with the given `key` and `value`. 

The code makes use of conditional statements, loops, and variable assignments to effectively insert new nodes into the AVL tree. This implementation ensures that the tree remains balanced and provides efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.

In conclusion, this code snippet showcases some of the data types and structures available in the NIM programming language, as well as the use of procedures and control flow to manipulate and interact with them.
