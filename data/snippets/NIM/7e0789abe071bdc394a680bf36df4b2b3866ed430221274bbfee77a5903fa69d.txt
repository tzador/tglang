# This code snippet uses the NIM programming language.
# It calculates the fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number.

# Define a function to calculate the fibonacci sequence
proc fibonacci_seq(num: int): seq[int] =
  # Create a dynamic array to store the sequence
  var sequence: seq[int] = @[0, 1]

  # Iterate through the numbers from 2 up to the user-specified number
  for i in 2..num:
    # Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
    let next_num = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]

    # Append the next number to the sequence
    sequence.add(next_num)

  # Return the final sequence
  return sequence

# Ask the user for a number and convert it to an integer
echo "Enter a number: "
let user_input = stdin.readLine().parseInt()

# Calculate the fibonacci sequence for the user's input
let fib_sequence = fibonacci_seq(user_input)

# Print the sequence to the console
echo "Fibonacci sequence up to" & $user_input & ": " & $fib_sequence
