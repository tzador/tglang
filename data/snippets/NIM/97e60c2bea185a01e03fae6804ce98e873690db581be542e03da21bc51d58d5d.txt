# This program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

# Function to calculate factorial
proc factorial(num: int): int =
  if num == 0:
    return 1 # Base case, factorial of 0 is 1
  else:
    return num * factorial(num - 1) # Recursive call to calculate factorial of num-1

# Main code
var numToCalculate: int = 7 # Number whose factorial needs to be calculated
var result: int = factorial(numToCalculate) # Calling factorial function, storing result in variable
echo "The factorial of ", numToCalculate, " is ", result # Printing the result

# Output:
# The factorial of 7 is 5040
