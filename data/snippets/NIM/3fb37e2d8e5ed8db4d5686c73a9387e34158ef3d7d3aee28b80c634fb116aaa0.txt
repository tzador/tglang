# This is a code snippet in NIM

# Create a type with a field that takes in a tuple of two integers
type
    Point = object
        x, y: (int, int)
        
# Define a procedure that takes in a Point type as an argument and returns a string
proc getPointString(p: Point): string =
    result = "The point has coordinates (" & $p.x & ", " & $p.y & ")"
    
# Create an instance of the Point type and assign values to its fields
var myPoint: Point
myPoint.x = 5
myPoint.y = 7

# Print the string generated by the getPointString procedure for the myPoint instance
echo getPointString(myPoint)

# Output: The point has coordinates (5, 7)
