#This is a code snippet in NIM language that calculates the factorial of a number recursively.
#It takes in a value n and returns the factorial of n.
#Define a procedure called "factorial" that takes in a value n of type Int and returns an Int:
proc factorial(n: int): int = 
    #Check if n is equal to one:
    if n == 1:
        #Return one:
        return 1
    else:
        #Calculate the factorial of n-1 using recursion:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

#Call the procedure with an input value of 5 and store the result in a variable called "result":
var result = factorial(5)

#Print the result:
echo result
