# This is a code example of finding the sum of two numbers in Nim
# Start of program
# Declaring variables
var

  second_number: int
  sum: int

# Capturing user input
echo "Enter first number: "
first_number = readInt()

echo "Enter second number: "
second_number = readInt()

# Calculating sum
sum = first_number + second_number

# Displaying result
echo "The sum of ", first_number, " and ", second_number, " is ", sum
