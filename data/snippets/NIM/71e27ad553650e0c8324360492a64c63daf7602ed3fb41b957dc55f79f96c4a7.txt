# This is a complex code snippet in the programming language NIM.
# It demonstrates the use of various built-in functions and control structures.

# First, we define a variable to store an integer value
var myInt: int = 10

# Next, we create a for loop that iterates from 1 to 10
for i in 1..10:
    # Within the loop, we check if the current value of i is equal to the value of myInt
    if i == myInt:
        # If they are equal, we print a message using the `echo` function
        echo "Match found!"
    else:
        # Otherwise, we print the value of i
        echo i

# Next, we define a function with parameters and a return type
func sum(x: int, y: int): int =
    # The function adds the two parameters and returns the sum
    return x + y

# We call the function and store the returned value in a variable
var result: int = sum(5, 10)

# Finally, we use a switch statement to check the value of result
switch result:
    # If the value is less than 10, we print a message
    < 10:
        echo "Result is less than 10"
    # If the value is between 10 and 20, we print a different message
    > 10 and < 20:
        echo "Result is between 10 and 20"
    # If the value is greater than 20, we print a third message
    > 20:
        echo "Result is greater than 20"
