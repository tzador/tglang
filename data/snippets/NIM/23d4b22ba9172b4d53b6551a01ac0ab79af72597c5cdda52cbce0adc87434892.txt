# This is a sample code snippet in NIM programming language
# It generates a random number and checks if it is even or odd
var
  randomNumber: int = rand(100) # generates a random number between 0 and 100 and stores it in 'randomNumber' variable
if randomNumber mod 2 == 0: # checks if randomNumber is divisible by 2, which means it is even
  echo "The random number is even: ", randomNumber # prints a message along with the random even number
else: 
  echo "The random number is odd: ", randomNumber # prints a message along with the random odd number
