# This code snippet is a simple program to calculate the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
# It uses a recursive function to find the term and prints the result
# Define the recursive function that takes in the term number as the parameter
proc fibonacci(n: int): int =
  # Check if the term number is either 1 or 2
  if n == 1 or n == 2:
    # If yes, return 1
    return 1
  else:
    # If not, use the recursive function to find the previous two terms
    # Add them together to get the nth term
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Ask the user to input the nth term they want to calculate
echo "Enter the term number you want to calculate: "
# Read and store the input
let userInput = readLine(stdin)
# Convert the input to an integer
let termNum: int = parseInt(userInput)
# Call the fibonacci function and store the result
let result: int = fibonacci(termNum)
# Print the result
echo "The nth term in the Fibonacci sequence is: ", result
