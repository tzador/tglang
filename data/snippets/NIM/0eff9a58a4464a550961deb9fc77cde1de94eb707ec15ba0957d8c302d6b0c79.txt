## Calculating Factorial of a Number 

proc factorial(n: int): int =
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

let num = 7
echo "Factorial of " & $num & " is " & factorial(num)

## Explanation:
# This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the factorial of a given number in NIM programming language.
# First, a proc (procedure) named factorial is defined, which takes in an integer as a parameter and returns an integer.
# Inside the proc, a base case is defined where if the input number is 0, the factorial will return 1.
# Otherwise, the factorial will recursively call itself and multiply the input number by the factorial of (n - 1).
# The function ends with a let statement to define a variable num and an echo statement to print the factorial of that number.
# The output of the code is: Factorial of 7 is 5040
