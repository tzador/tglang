# First, we declare a variable named 'name' and assign it a string value
var name = "John"

# Next, we declare a constant named 'AGE_LIMIT' and assign it an integer value
const AGE_LIMIT = 18

# Then, we ask the user for their age and convert it to an integer
echo "Please enter your age: "
var age = parseInt(read())

# We use a conditional statement to check if the user's age is above the age limit
# If it is, we print a message informing them they are eligible
if age > AGE_LIMIT:
    echo "Congratulations, " & name & "! You are eligible to sign up."

# If the user's age is below the age limit, we print a message stating they are not eligible
else:
    echo "Sorry, " & name & ", you are not old enough to sign up."

# Finally, we print a goodbye message
echo "Thank you for using our program, " & name & "!"
