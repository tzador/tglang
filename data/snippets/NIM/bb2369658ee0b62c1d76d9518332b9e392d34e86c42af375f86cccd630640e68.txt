## This is a complex code snippet in NIM language.
## It calculates the factorial of a given number recursively.

# Declare a procedure to calculate factorial recursively
proc factorial(n: int): int =
  if n <= 1:
    result = 1
  else:
    result = n * factorial(n - 1)

# Ask user for input
echo "Enter a number: "

# Get input and convert to integer
let num = readLine(parseInt)

# Call the recursive function and print the result
echo "Factorial of ", num, " is ", factorial(num)
