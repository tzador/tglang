#This code snippet is a game of NIM, where two players take turns
#removing sticks from a pile. The player who takes the last stick
#wins.
#This code uses variables, loops, and conditions.

#Initialize the starting number of sticks
var sticks: int = 21

#Start the game loop
while sticks > 0:
    #Player 1 turn
    echo("Player 1's turn:")
    echo("There are ", sticks, "sticks left.")
    #Ask for the number of sticks to remove
    let move: int = readLine(stdin)
    #Check if the input is valid
    if move < 1 or move > 3 or move > sticks:
        echo("Invalid move, please choose 1, 2, or 3 sticks.")
        continue
    #Remove the chosen number of sticks
    sticks -= move
    #Check if player 1 wins
    if sticks == 0:
        echo("Player 1 wins!")
        break

    #Player 2 turn
    echo("Player 2's turn:")
    echo("There are ", sticks, "sticks left.")
    #Ask for the number of sticks to remove
    let move: int = readLine(stdin)
    #Check if the input is valid
    if move < 1 or move > 3 or move > sticks:
        echo("Invalid move, please choose 1, 2, or 3 sticks.")
        continue
    #Remove the chosen number of sticks
    sticks -= move
    #Check if player 2 wins
    if sticks == 0:
        echo("Player 2 wins!")
        break
