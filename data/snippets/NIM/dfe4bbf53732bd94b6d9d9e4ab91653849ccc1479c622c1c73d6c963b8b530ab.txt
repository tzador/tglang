## an example code in NIM

# define a tuple type containing employee's information
type
    Employee = tuple[
        name: string,
        age: int,
        position: string,
        salary: float,
    ]

# create a variable of type Employee and assign values
var employee1: Employee = (
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 25,
    position: "Manager",
    salary: 5000.00,
)

# create an empty dynamic array of employees
var employees: seq[Employee]

# append employee1 to the dynamic array
employees.add(employee1)

# create a function that calculates the total salary of all employees
proc calculateTotalSalary(employees: seq[Employee]): float =
    var totalSalary: float = 0.0
    for employee in employees:
        totalSalary += employee.salary
    result = totalSalary

# call the function and print the result
echo "Total salary of all employees: ", calculateTotalSalary(employees)
