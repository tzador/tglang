# This code snippet uses the Nim programming language
# to define a recursive function that calculates the
# factorial of a given number.

# Define the factorial function with a parameter n
proc factorial(n: int): int =
  # Check for base case of n equal to 1
  if n == 1:
    # Return 1 as the factorial of 1 is 1
    return 1
  else:
    # Use recursion to calculate factorial of n-1
    # and multiply it by n to get factorial of n
    return n * factorial(n-1)

# Main function to test the factorial function
proc main() =
  # Define a variable to hold the input number
  var number: int = 5
  # Call the factorial function with the input number
  var result = factorial(number)
  # Print the result
  echo "Factorial of " & $number & " is " & $result

# Call the main function to run the program
main()

# Output:
# Factorial of 5 is 120
