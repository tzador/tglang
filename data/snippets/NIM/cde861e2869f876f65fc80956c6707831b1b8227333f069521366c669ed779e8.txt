# This code snippet is written in NIM programming language
# It is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
proc factorial(n: int): int =
    if n == 0:                     # base case
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)  # recursive call

# calling the function
echo factorial(5)  # output: 120 (5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
