# This is a code snippet in the NIM programming language
# This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

# Declare a procedure for calculating the Fibonacci sequence
proc fibonacci(num: int): int =
    # Check for base cases
    if num < 0:
        return -1
    elif num == 0 or num == 1:
        return num
    else:
        # Call the fibonacci procedure recursively
        return fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci(num - 2)

# Initialize an empty array to store the sequence
var sequence: seq[int] = @[]

# Prompt user to input a number
echo "Enter a number: "

# Read the user input and convert it to an integer
var num: int = readInt()

# Loop from 0 to the user input number
for i in 0..num:
    # Call the fibonacci procedure to calculate the current sequence number
    var result: int = fibonacci(i)
    # Append the result to the array
    sequence.add(result)

# Print the final sequence
echo "The Fibonacci sequence up to $num is: "
echo sequence

# Output:
#
