# This code snippet uses a Nim macro to print "Hello, World!" 10 times

# Declare a macro named "manyTimes" that takes in two parameters: the number of times to print and the code to be printed
macro manyTimes(n: int, codeToRun: untyped) =
  # Create a for loop that loops from 1 to n using a variable named "i"
  for i in 1 .. n:
    # Use Nim's printf function to print the code passed in
    printf(codeToRun)

# Call the manyTimes macro with 10 as the value for n and the code "Hello, World!" to be printed
manyTimes(10, "Hello, World!")
