## This is a code snippet in NIM that generates a random password of a given length

import random

## Declare a global constant for the characters used in the password generation
const CHARACTERS = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+"

## Define a password generator function which takes in the length of the password as a parameter
proc generate_password(length: int): string =
    var password: string = ""

    ## Use a for loop to iterate through the length of the password
    for i in 0 ..< length:
        ## Generate a random index within the range of the characters string
        var index = random(0 ..< CHARACTERS.len)
        ## Add the character at the generated index to the password string
        password &= CHARACTERS[index]

    ## Return the generated password
    return password

## Store the length of the desired password in a variable
var password_length = 10
## Call the password generator function with the password length variable as the argument and store the generated password in another variable
var password = generate_password(password_length)

## Print out the generated password
echo "Your randomly generated password of length " & $password_length & " is: " & $password
