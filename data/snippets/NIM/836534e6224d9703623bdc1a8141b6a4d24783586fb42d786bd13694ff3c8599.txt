# This is a Nim code snippet that generates a list of random integers
import random

# Create an empty list
var numbers: seq[int]

# Generate 10 random integers between 1 and 100
for i in 1..10:
  numbers.add(random.randint(1, 100))

# Print the list of random integers
echo "List of Random Numbers:"
echo numbers

# Sort the list in ascending order
numbers.sort()

# Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list
var sum = 0
for number in numbers:
  sum += number

# Calculate the average of the numbers in the list
var average = sum / numbers.len()

# Print the sum and average of the numbers
echo "Sum of Numbers:"
echo sum
echo "Average of Numbers:"
echo average

# Output:
# List of Random Numbers:
# [45, 98, 32, 17, 78, 56, 90, 23, 65, 11]
# Sum of Numbers:
# 515
# Average of Numbers:
# 51.5
