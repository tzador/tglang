# Define a variable
var = "NIM is a programming language used for creating efficient and concise code."

# Create a function that returns the square root of a number
proc squareRoot(x: float): float =

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Use an algorithm to find the sum of the list
var sum = algorithm.sum(numbers)

# Print the sum and the square root of the sum
echo "The sum of the list is: ", sum

# Use a loop to iterate through the list and print each number
for i in numbers:

# Create a dictionary of programming languages
