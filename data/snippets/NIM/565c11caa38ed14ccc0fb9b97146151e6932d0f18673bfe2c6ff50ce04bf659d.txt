## Fibonacci Sequence using Dynamic Programming
proc fibonacci(n: int): int =
  # Base case
  if n <= 1:
    return n
  else:
    # Initialize two variables to store previous values of the sequence
    var prev1 = 0
    var prev2 = 1
    # Loop from 2 to n to calculate the fibonacci sequence
    for i in 2..n:
      # Calculate the next value in the sequence by summing the previous two values
      var next = prev1 + prev2
      # Update the previous values with the current value
      prev1 = prev2
      prev2 = next
    return next

# Call the fibonacci function and print the first 10 numbers in the sequence
for i in 0..9:
  echo fibonacci(i)
