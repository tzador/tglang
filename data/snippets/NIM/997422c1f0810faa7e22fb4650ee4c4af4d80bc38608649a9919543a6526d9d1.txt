# Define a sequence of integers from 1 to 10 using the range function
let nums = range(1, 11)

# Create an empty list to store the squared values
var squared = []

# Loop through the sequence and square each number
for num in nums:
    squared.add(num**2)

# Convert the list into a set to remove duplicates
var squared_set = squared.toSet()

# Print the set of squared numbers
print(squared_set)
