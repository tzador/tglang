# This is a code snippet in NIM programming language
# It calculates the sum of odd numbers from 1 to n using recursion

# Declare a function that takes in an integer as an argument
proc odd_sum(n: int): int = 
    if n <= 0: # If n is less than or equal to 0, return 0 as the sum
        return 0
    else:
        return n + odd_sum(n - 2) # Calculate the sum of n and the sum of odd_numbers(n-2)

# Declare a variable to store the input
var n: int = 10

# Call the function and store the result in a variable
var result: int = odd_sum(n)

# Print the result
echo "Sum of odd numbers from 1 to ", $n, " is ", $result # Output: Sum of odd numbers from 1 to 10 is 25
