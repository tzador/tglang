# This program calculates the area of a circle

# Import the math library for accessing mathematical functions
import math

# Define a constant for the value of pi
const pi = 3.14159

# Create a variable to store the radius of the circle
var radius: float

# Prompt user to enter the radius of the circle
echo "Enter the radius of the circle: "

# Read user input and convert it to a float
radius = parseFloat(readLine(stdin))

# Calculate the area of the circle using the formula A = πr²
var area = pi * radius * radius

# Print the result to the console with 4 decimal places
echo "The area of the circle with radius ", radius, " is ", "%.4f" % area

# Additional comments and annotations can be added below
# This code follows the proper structure of a NIM program
# The math library is imported to access the pi constant and perform calculations
# The radius is stored as a float variable to allow for decimal values
# The readLine() function reads user input from the console and the parseFloat() function converts it to a float
# The math formula for calculating the area of a circle is used to calculate and store the result in the area variable
# The final result is printed to the console with 4 decimal places using the "%.4f" syntax
