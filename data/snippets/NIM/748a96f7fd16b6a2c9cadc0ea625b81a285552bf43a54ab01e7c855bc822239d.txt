# NIM game in Nim programming language 
# NIM is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps. 
# The goal of the game is to be the player who removes the last object.
# The variables to be used in this game are defined as follows:

var
  heaps: array[int] # the heaps of objects
  current_player: int # the current player, 1 for player 1 and 2 for player 2
  current_heap: int # the index of the current heap being played

# Function to check if the game is over
proc game_over(): bool = 
  # The game is over if there are no more objects in any heap
  for heap in heaps:
    if heap != 0:
      return false
  return true

# Function to print the current status of the game
proc print_game_status() =
  # Prints the number of objects in each heap
  for i in 0 ..< heaps.len:
    echo "Heap ", i+1, ": ", heaps[i]
  # Prints the current player
  echo "Current player: ", current_player

# Function to get valid user input for the number of objects to remove from a heap
proc input_objects_to_remove(): int = 
  var
    objects_to_remove: int
  objects_to_remove = readLine(stdin).parseInt()
  # Validates the user input
  while objects_to_remove < 1 or objects_to_remove > heaps[current_heap]:
    echo "Invalid input. Please enter a number from 1 to ", heaps[current_heap], "."
    objects_to_remove = readLine(stdin).parseInt()
  return objects_to_remove

# Function for handling the turn of a player
proc play_turn() =
  # Print game status
  print_game_status()
  # Get valid input for the heap to be played
  echo "Player ", current_player, ", choose a heap to play: "
  current_heap = readLine(stdin).parseInt() - 1
  # Validate input
  while current_heap < 0 or current_heap >= heaps.len or heaps[current_heap] == 0:
    echo "Invalid input. Please choose a valid heap (1 to ", heaps.len, ") with at least one object."
    current_heap = readLine(stdin).parseInt() - 1
  # Get valid input for number of objects to remove
  echo "Player ", current_player, ", choose the number of objects to remove: "
  var objects_to_remove: int = input_objects_to_remove()
  # Update heap
  heaps[current_heap] -= objects_to_remove

# Main game loop
while game_over() == false:
  # Alternate the current player
  if current_player == 1:
    current_player = 2
  else:
    current_player = 1
  # Play the turn of the current player
  play_turn()
  
# Print the game result 
echo "Player ", current_player, " has won the game!"
