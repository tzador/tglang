#This is a Nim code snippet that calculates the factorial of a given number
#Input number to calculate factorial for
var input_num: int = 10 
#Variable to store the factorial result
var factorial: int = 1 

#Loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to input_num
for i in 1..input_num: 
  #Multiply the current factorial value with the current value of i
  factorial *= i
  
#Output the factorial result 
echo "The factorial of ", input_num, " is ", factorial
