# This is a code snippet in NIM
# It generates a simple sorting algorithm
# Declare the array to be sorted

# Variable to track if any swaps were made during sorting
var swaps_happened = true
# Loop through the array until no swaps are made
while swaps_happened:

    # Loop through the array and compare consecutive elements
    for i in 0..len(arr)-2:
