# This code will calculate the average of numbers using a user-defined function.

# Define a function named 'calculate_average' that takes in a variable number of arguments.

    # Check if there are no numbers passed in as arguments.
    if numbers.len == 0:

        return 0
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of all numbers.
    var sum:int = 0
    # Loop through each number in the varargs argument.
    for number in numbers:
        # Add the current number to the sum.
        sum += number
    # Calculate the length of the numbers argument to use as the denominator for calculating average.
    var length:int = numbers.len
    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length.
    var average:float = float(sum) / float(length)
    # Print out the average.
    echo "The average of the numbers passed in is: " & $average
    # Return the calculated average.
    return average

# Call the 'calculate_average' function passing in 5 numbers.
