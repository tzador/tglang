# This code snippet takes a list of numbers and finds the largest number
# in the list using a nested while loop.

# Function to find the largest number in a list
func findLargest(numbers: list[int]): int =
    # Initialize variables
    var current_largest = numbers[0] # Set it to first number in list
    var index = 0 # Start at index 0

    # Outer while loop to iterate through list
    while index < len(numbers):
        var current_number = numbers[index] # Set current number to current index in list

        # Inner while loop to compare current number to current largest
        var inner_index = 1 # Start at index 1
        while inner_index < len(numbers):
            var next_number = numbers[inner_index] # Set next number to inner index in list
            if next_number > current_number: # Compare next number to current number
                current_number = next_number # If next number is larger, set current number to it

            inner_index += 1 # Increment inner index

        if current_number > current_largest: # Compare current number to current largest
            current_largest = current_number # If current number is larger, set it to current largest

        index += 1 # Increment outer index

    return current_largest # Return largest number in list

# Example usage
var numbers = [12, 45, 23, 67, 9, 105, 81]
echo "The largest number is " & $findLargest(numbers) # Prints "The largest number is 105"
