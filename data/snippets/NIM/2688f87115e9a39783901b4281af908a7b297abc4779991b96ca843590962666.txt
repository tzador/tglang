# This is a code snippet in NIM that generates a Fibonacci sequence
# up to a specified number, input by the user.

# First, we initialize a variable 'limit' to store the user's input.
var limit: int = readInt(stdin)

# We then create an empty sequence, where we will generate our Fibonacci sequence.
var sequence: seq[int] = @[]

# We push the first two numbers (0 and 1) of the sequence into our empty sequence.
sequence.add(0)
sequence.add(1)

# Loop through the rest of the sequence, generating the Fibonacci numbers and pushing them
# into the sequence until the limit is reached.
for i in 2..limit-1:
  # We calculate the next Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers.
  let nextFib: int = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]
  # We push this number into our sequence.
  sequence.add(nextFib)

# Finally, we print out the generated sequence in a formatted string.
echo "The Fibonacci sequence up to " & $limit & " is: " & sequence

# Sample output: The Fibonacci sequence up to 10 is: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
