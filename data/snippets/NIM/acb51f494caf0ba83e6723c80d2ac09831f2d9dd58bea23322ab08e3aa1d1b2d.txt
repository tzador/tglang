# This is a code snippet in NIM programming language
# It generates the Factorial of a given number using recursion

# Define a function to calculate factorial
proc factorial(n: int): int =
    if n == 0:
        # If n is zero, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
        return 1
    else:
        # If n is not equal to 0, recursively call the function with n-1 and multiply it by n
        return factorial(n-1) * n

# Get input from user for the number whose factorial is to be calculated
echo "Enter a number:"
var num = readLine(stdin)

# Convert input to integer and store it in a variable
var number = parseInt(num)

# Calculate the factorial of the input number by calling the factorial function
var result = factorial(number)

# Print the result
echo "The factorial of ", number, " is ", result
