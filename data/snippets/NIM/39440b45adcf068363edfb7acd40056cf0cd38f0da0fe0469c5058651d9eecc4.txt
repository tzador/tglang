## Define a new type called 'Person' with three fields
type
  Person = object
    name*: string
    age*: int
    height*: float

## Create a sequence of Person objects
var people = @[
  Person(name: "John", age: 25, height: 1.75),
  Person(name: "Jane", age: 30, height: 1.65),
  Person(name: "Bob", age: 35, height: 1.85)
]

## Define a procedure called 'get_average' with one parameter of type sequence
proc get_average(people: seq[Person]): float =
  ## Initialize variables to store sum and count
  var sum = 0
  var count = 0
  
  ## Use a for loop to iterate through each person in the sequence
  for person in people:
    ## Add their age to the sum
    sum += person.age
    ## Increase the count by 1
    count += 1
  
  ## Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count
  result = float(sum) / count
  
  ## Return the average
  return result

## Call the get_average procedure and print the result
echo get_average(people)
