# This is a code snippet in the NIM programming language.
# It creates a new sequence, adds elements to it, and prints the final sequence.

# Import the sequtils module
import sequtils

# Define a new sequence named "myList" with type string
var myList: seq[string]

# Add elements to the sequence using the add function
add(myList, "apple")
add(myList, "banana")
add(myList, "orange")

# Print the length of the sequence using the len function
echo("The length of the sequence is: ", len(myList))

# Create a for loop that iterates through the elements in the sequence
for fruit in myList:
  # Print each element in the sequence
  echo("Fruit: ", fruit)

# Sort the sequence in alphabetical order using the sort function
sort(myList)

# Print the sorted sequence
echo("Sorted sequence: ", myList)

# Remove the element at index 1 in the sequence using the delfirst function
delfirst(myList)

# Print the updated sequence
echo("Updated sequence: ", myList)
