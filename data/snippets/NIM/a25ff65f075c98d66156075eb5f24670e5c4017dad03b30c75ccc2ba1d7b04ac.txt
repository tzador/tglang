# This program calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
var
    n: int  # variable to hold the input from user
    first: int = 0  # first element in the sequence

    result: int = 0  # variable to store the result
    
echo "Enter the value of n: " # prompts user for input
n = readInt()  # reads input and assigns to n

# loop through the sequence to calculate the nth term
for i in 2..n:
    result = first + second # calculates the next term
    first = second  # assigns value of second to first
    second = result  # assigns new result to second

echo "The nth term in the Fibonacci sequence is: ", result # prints out the result
