# A simple program that performs a linear search on an array

# Define the function to search for a key in the array
proc linear_search(array: seq[int], key: int): int =

    # Define the variables
    var index, i: int = 0

    # Loop through the array until the key is found or the end is reached
    while i < len(array) and array[i] != key:
        i += 1

    # Check if the key was found
    if i < len(array):
        index = i # Save the index
    else:
        index = -1 # Set index to -1 to indicate key was not found

    # Return the index
    return index

# Define an array to search through
var nums = @[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Perform the search
var result = linear_search(nums, 5)

# Display the result
echo "Result: ", result # Output: Result: 4
