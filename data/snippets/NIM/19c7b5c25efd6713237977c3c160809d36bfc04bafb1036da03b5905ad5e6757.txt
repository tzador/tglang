## This code snippet is a function named 'word_count' that counts the number of words in a string.

proc word_count(M: string): int =
  ## The function takes in a string 'M' and returns an integer value.
  var count = 1  
  ## The 'count' variable initializes to 1, assuming the string contains at least one word. 
  for i in 0..<len(M):  
    ## The for loop iterates through each character in the string.
    if M[i] == ' ':
      ## Checks if the current character is a space.
      count += 1  
      ## If it is a space, increment the count by 1.
  return count 
  ## Return the final count value.

var my_string = "This is a sample string."  
## Example string to test the function.
echo word_count(my_string)  
## Prints the output of the function, which should be 5 since there are 5 words in the string.
