# This code snippet generates a simple sorting algorithm using the Bubble Sort method
# The algorithm takes in a list of numbers and sorts them in ascending order
# It uses a loop to iterate through each number and compare it to the next number
# If the current number is larger than the next number, they are swapped
# This process is repeated until the list is fully sorted, indicated by a boolean variable

# function to perform bubble sort
proc bubbleSort(numbers: seq[int]): seq[int] =
    # variable to indicate if sorting is finished
    var finished = true
    
    # loop through the numbers list
    for i in 0 ..< numbers.len - 1:
        # compare current number with next number
        if numbers[i] > numbers[i+1]:
            # swap numbers if current number is larger
            numbers[i], numbers[i+1] = numbers[i+1], numbers[i]
            # indicate that sorting is not finished yet
            finished = false
    
    # if sorting is not finished, recursively call function again
    if not finished:
        bubbleSort(numbers)
    
    # return sorted list
    return numbers

# example input
var nums = [5, 3, 9, 2, 7]

# perform bubble sort
var sortedNums = bubbleSort(nums)

# print sorted list
echo "Sorted numbers: ", sortedNums
