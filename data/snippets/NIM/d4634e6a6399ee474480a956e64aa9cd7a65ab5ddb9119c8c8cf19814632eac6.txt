# This code snippet is written in NIM, a statically-typed programming language.
# It uses a function to recursively find the factorial of a given number.
proc factorial(num: int): int =
    # Declare and initialize the variable result
    var result = 1

    # Base case: if num is 0 or 1, return 1
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        return result

    # Recursively call the factorial function with num-1 as the argument,
    # then multiply the result with num and assign it to result.
    result = factorial(num-1) * num

    # Return the final result
    return result

# Call the factorial function with the number 5 and print the result
echo factorial(5)
