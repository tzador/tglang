#This is a simple program written in NIM language
#It takes two numbers as input and prints their sum
import math

#declaring variables to store user input
var num1, num2: int

#taking user input
echo "Enter the first number: "
num1 = readLine(parseInt)
echo "Enter the second number: "
num2 = readLine(parseInt)

#calculating sum
var sum: int = num1 + num2

#printing result
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum"
