proc factorial (n: int): int = 
    # This function calculates the factorial of a given number
    if n < 1:
        result = 1

        result = 1

# This is a recursive function that calls itself to solve the problem.
# It uses the if-elif-else structure to handle different scenarios.
# The result variable is used to store the calculated value.
# This snippet can be used for educational purposes in teaching recursion.
