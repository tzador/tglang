# This code snippet is written in NIM, a statically typed, compiled programming language.

# First, we import the 'os' module to use its functions for directory manipulations.
import os

# Next, we define a 'print_directory_contents' procedure that takes in a directory path and prints all its contents.
proc print_directory_contents(path: string) =
    # We use the 'getDirContents' function from the 'os' module to get a list of all the files and sub-directories in the given path.
    var contents = getDirContents(path)
    # We loop through each item in the list and print its name using 'echo' statement.
    for item in contents:
        echo item

# We define a 'main' function to be the entry point of our program.
proc main() =
    # We ask the user for a directory path using 'readLine' function and store it in a variable.
    var dir_path = readLine("Enter a directory path: ")
    # We call the 'print_directory_contents' procedure and pass in the user input as argument.
    print_directory_contents(dir_path)

# Finally, we call the 'main' function to start our program.
main()
