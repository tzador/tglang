# This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
proc factorial(x: int): int =
    # Define a variable to store the result
    var result: int = 1
    
    # Loop through numbers from 1 to x
    for i in 1..x:
        # Calculate the factorial
        result *= i
        
    # Return the result
    return result

# Call the function with input value of 5 and print the output
echo factorial(5)

# Output: 120 

# This code snippet also contains a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number
proc recursiveFactorial(x: int): int =
    # Base case: if x is equal to 0, return 1
    if x == 0:
        return 1
        
    # Recursive case: call the function again with x-1 and multiply it by x
    return x * recursiveFactorial(x-1)

# Call the recursive function with input value of 5 and print the output
echo recursiveFactorial(5)

# Output: 120
