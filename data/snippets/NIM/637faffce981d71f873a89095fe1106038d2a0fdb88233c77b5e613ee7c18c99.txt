# This program generates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
var n, a, b, c: int
a = 0 # Initializing first number of sequence
b = 1 # Initializing second number of sequence
c = 0 # Variable to hold calculated value
for i in 0..9: # Looping 10 times
    c = a + b   # Calculating next Fibonacci number
    echo c      # Outputting calculated value
    a = b       # Moving to next value in sequence
    b = c       # Moving to next value in sequence
