# This is a code snippet in the NIM programming language
# This code takes in a list of numbers and sorts them using the bubble sort algorithm

# Define a procedure to perform bubble sort
proc bubbleSort(inputList: seq[int]): seq[int] =
  var size = inputList.len

  # Loop through the list for each element
  for i in 1..size:
    # For each element, loop through the list from end to i
    for j in (size - 1).downto(i):
      # If the element is larger than the next element, swap them
      if inputList[j] > inputList[j + 1]:
        # Perform the swap
        var temp = inputList[j]
        inputList[j] = inputList[j + 1]
        inputList[j + 1] = temp

  # Return the sorted list
  result = inputList

# Define a list of numbers to be sorted
var numbers = [5, 1, 3, 7, 2, 8, 4]

# Call the bubble sort procedure with our list of numbers
var sortedNumbers = bubbleSort(numbers)

# Print the sorted list
echo("Sorted Numbers: ", sortedNumbers)
