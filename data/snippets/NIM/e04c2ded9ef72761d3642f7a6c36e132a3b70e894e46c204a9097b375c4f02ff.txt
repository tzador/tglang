# This is a NIM code snippet that generates a randomized list of numbers
# In NIM, the 'random' module is used to generate random numbers

import random # Importing the 'random' module

var
    n: int # Declaring a variable 'n' of type integer
    num_list: seq[int] # Declaring a variable 'num_list' of type sequence of integers
    
echo "Enter the size of the list:"  # Outputting to the user to enter the size of the list
readln(n) # Reading the input from the user and storing it in the variable 'n'

for i in 0..<n: # Initializing a loop to iterate from 0 to 'n'
    num_list.add(random(1..100)) # Using the 'random' function to add a random number between 1 and 100 to the list

echo "Random list of numbers:" # Outputting to the user that the list of numbers is generated
for num in num_list: # For loop to iterate over the generated list of numbers
    echo num # Outputting each number in the list
