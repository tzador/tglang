# This is a program that takes in a list of numbers and returns
# the sum of all odd numbers in the list

var
  numbers: seq[int] # declare a sequence of integers
  sum: int = 0 # initialize the variable sum to 0
 
echo "Enter the size of the list: "
var
  size: int = readLine(parseInt()) # read input from user and store as integer

# loop to read in numbers and add to list
for i in 1..size:
  echo "Enter number ", i, ": "
  var
    num: int = readLine(parseInt()) # read input from user and store as integer
    numbers.add(num) # add number to the list

# loop through the list and add all odd numbers to the sum variable
for i in numbers:
  if i % 2 == 1: # check if number is odd
    sum += i # add number to the sum variable
  else:
    continue # if number is even, continue to next iteration
 
echo "The sum of all odd numbers is: ", sum # print the final sum to the console
