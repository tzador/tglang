# This program calculates the mean of given numbers
var
  i, num, sum: int     # declaring variables 'i', 'num' and 'sum' as integers
  numbers: array[1..5] of float   # declaring a 5-element array 'numbers'
  mean: float    # declaring variable 'mean' as float

echo("Enter 5 numbers:")
for i in 1..5:    # loop to iterate 5 times
  input(numbers[i])   # taking input from user for each element of the array
  inc(sum, numbers[i])   # adding the input value to 'sum'
end

mean = sum/5   # calculating mean by dividing 'sum' by the number of elements
echo("The mean of the given numbers is: ", mean)   # printing the mean

# Sample output:
# Enter 5 numbers:
# 10
# 15
# 20
# 25
# 30
# The mean of the given numbers is: 20.0
