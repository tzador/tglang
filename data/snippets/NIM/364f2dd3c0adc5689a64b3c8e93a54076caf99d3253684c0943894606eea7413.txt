# This is a code snippet in Nim programming language.
# It generates a random sequence of numbers that are multiples of 5.

import random # Importing the random module for generating random numbers

# Defining a function to generate a random sequence of multiples of 5 with a specified length
func generateMultiples(numLen: int): seq[int] =
  var result = newSeq[int](numLen)  # Creating a new sequence to store the results
  for i in 0..numLen-1:
    result[i] = random(20) * 5  # Generating a random multiple of 5 between 0 and 100
  return result

let numbers = generateMultiples(10)  # Calling the function to generate a sequence of 10 numbers
echo "Random sequence of multiples of 5 with length 10: ", numbers  # Printing the sequence

# Output:
