# This is an example of a complex code snippet in the NIM programming language.
# It creates a 'Student' class and uses a 'record' to store data for each student.

# The first section of code defines the 'Student' class, setting up its structure and fields.
# The 'name', 'age' and 'grade' fields are defined as strings, integers and floats, respectively.
# The 'init' method is used to initialize a new 'Student' object and assign values to its fields.

class Student:
  var name: string
  var age: int
  var grade: float

  # the 'init' method takes in the values for each field as parameters and assigns them to the object's fields.
  method init(new_name: string, new_age: int, new_grade: float) =
    self.name = new_name
    self.age = new_age
    self.grade = new_grade

# The second section of code creates a new 'record' called 'student_data'.
# This record will be used to store data for each student, such as their name, age and grade.

record student_data:
  name: string
  age: int
  grade: float

# The 'for' statement is used to iterate through a range of numbers, in this case, from 1 to 10.
# Within the for loop, a new 'student_data' record is created and values are assigned to its fields.
# These values are then used to initialize a new 'Student' object, which is added to the 'student_list' array.
# This process is repeated 10 times, creating 10 different 'Student' objects.

var student_list: array[10, Student]
for i in 1..10:
  var data = student_data("Student " & $i, i, i*2.5)
  student_list[i] = Student(data.name, data.age, data.grade)

# The last section of code prints the information for each student in the 'student_list' array.
# This is achieved using a for loop to iterate through the array and print the values of each object.

for student in student_list:
  echo("Name: " & student.name)
  echo("Age: " & $student.age)
  echo("Grade: " & $student.grade)
  echo()
