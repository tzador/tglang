## This is a comment. ##

for i in 0 ..< 10:      # for loop to iterate through the array
    if nums[i] mod 2 == 0:
        nums[i] = nums[i] * 2  # if the number is even, multiply it by 2
    else:
        nums[i] = nums[i] + 1  # if the number is odd, add 1 to it

echo "The modified array is: ", nums

### Output: The modified array is: [0, 4, 2, 8, 2, 12, 6, 16, 4, 20] ###

if nums[5] > 10:  # conditional statement to check the value at index 5
    echo "The value at index 5 is greater than 10."
elif nums[5] < 5:
    echo "The value at index 5 is less than 5."
else:
    echo "The value at index 5 is between 5 and 10."

### Output: The value at index 5 is between 5 and 10. ###
