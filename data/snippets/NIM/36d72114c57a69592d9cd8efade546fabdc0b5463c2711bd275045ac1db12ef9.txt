## This is a NIM Program
# Create empty sequence
var my_sequence: seq[int] = @[]
for i in 0..10:
  # Add random numbers to sequence
  var num = Random(100)
  my_sequence.add(num)
# Sort sequence in descending order
my_sequence.sort(lambda (x, y) => y - x)

# Calculate the sum of all elements in sequence
var sum = 0
for num in my_sequence:
  sum += num

# Print the sorted sequence and the sum of its elements
echo "Sorted sequence: ", my_sequence
echo "Sum of elements: ", sum
