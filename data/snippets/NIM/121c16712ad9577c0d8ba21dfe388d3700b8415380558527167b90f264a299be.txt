# This code snippet generates a list of random numbers and sorts them in descending order

import random  # import the random library for generating random numbers

var numList: seq[int] = []  # declare an empty sequence of integers

# generate 10 random integers between 1 and 100 and add them to the sequence
for i in 0..9:
    numList.add(random.randint(1, 100))

# sort the sequence in descending order using the built-in sort function and the reverse keyword
numList.sort(reverse=true)

# print the sorted list
echo "Sorted list: ", numList
