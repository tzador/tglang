# This program generates the first 100 terms of the Fibonacci sequence
var n:int = 100 # Initialize variable n to store the number of terms to be generated
var first:int = 0 # Initialize variable first to store the first term of the sequence
var second:int = 1 # Initialize variable second to store the second term of the sequence
var next:int # Initialize variable next to store the next term to be generated
echo(first) # Print the first term of the sequence
echo(second) # Print the second term of the sequence
for i in 0..96: # Create a for loop to generate the next 98 terms of the sequence
    next = first + second # Calculate the next term by adding the first and second terms
    echo(next) # Print the next term
    first = second # Update the first term to be the previous second term
    second = next # Update the second term to be the next term
# The output will be the first 100 terms of the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
