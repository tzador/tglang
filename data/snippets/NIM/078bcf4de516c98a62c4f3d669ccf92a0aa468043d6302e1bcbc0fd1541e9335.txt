#NIM - Named Information Modelling Language
#This code snippet creates a class called Person with two
#properties and a method that calculates their age

#Create a class named Person, with two properties
#Name and birthYear
type
    Person = object
        name: string
        birthYear: int

#Create a method to calculate the age of the person
method calculateAge(person: Person): int =
    #Get the current year
    let currentYear = getCurrentYear()

    #Subtract the birth year from the current year
    var age = currentYear - person.birthYear

    #Check if the person has already had their birthday this year
    if getCurrentMonth() > 1:
        if getCurrentDay() > 1:
            age = age - 1

    #Return the age
    result = age

#Create an instance of Person class with name and birth year
var p: Person = Person(name: "John", birthYear: 1985)

#Call the calculateAge method and print the result
echo "John is " & p.calculateAge() & " years old"

#Returns "John is 35 years old" if current year is 2020
