## Nim Game Implementation
# This code snippet creates an implementation of the game Nim, where players take turns removing objects from a pile until there are none left.

# Define variables
var pile: int = 20  # Number of objects in the pile
var turn: int = 0   # Keep track of current player's turn (0 for Player 1, 1 for Player 2)

# While loop to continue game until pile is empty
while pile > 0:
    # Display current state of the game
    echo "Pile size: ", pile
    echo "Current turn: ", turn + 1, "\n"

    # Player's turn to remove objects from pile
    echo "Player ", turn + 1, "'s turn. Enter number of objects to remove: "
    var remove: int = readLine(stdin).parseInt()  # Read user input as integer

    # Validate input
    if remove <= 0 or remove > pile:
        echo "Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and ", pile, "\n"
        continue  # Restart while loop if input is invalid

    # Update pile size
    pile -= remove
    echo "Removed ", remove, " objects from the pile.\n"

    # Switch players for next turn
    turn = 1 - turn
    
# Display final winner
echo "Game over! Winner: Player ", turn + 1
