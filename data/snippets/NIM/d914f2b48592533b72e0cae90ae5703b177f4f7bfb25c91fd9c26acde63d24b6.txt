# Defining a proc to calculate factorial of a number
proc factorial(n: int): int =
  var result = 1
  for i in 1..n:
    result *= i

# Declaring a variable "arr" and assigning a list of numbers to it
var arr = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

# Using the "map" operation to square each element in the list
var squared = arr.map(n => n * n)

# Printing the squared list
echo "Squared List: ", squared

# Defining a table with necessary fields
table Employee:
  name*: string
  age*: int
  department*: string
  salary*: float

# Creating objects of the Employee table
var employee1 = Employee(name: "John", age: 28, department: "Marketing", salary: 50000.0)
var employee2 = Employee(name: "Alice", age: 32, department: "Finance", salary: 75000.0)

# Adding objects to the table
Employee.add(employee1)
Employee.add(employee2)

# Printing the number of objects in the table
echo "Number of employees: ", Employee.len()

# Defining a proc to calculate the distance between two points using Pythagorean theorem
proc distance(x1: float, y1: float, x2: float, y2: float): float =
  var distance_x = x1-x2
  var distance_y = y1-y2
  var distance = math.sqrt(distance_x * distance_x + distance_y * distance_y)
  return distance

# Calling the proc and printing the result
echo "Distance between points (2, 3) and (5, 6) is : ", distance(2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0)
