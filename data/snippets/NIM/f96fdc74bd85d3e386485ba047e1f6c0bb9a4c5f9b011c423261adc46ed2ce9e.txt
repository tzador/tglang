## This is a function that calculates the sum of two numbers
proc sum(x, y: int): int =
    if x == 0:
        return y
    elif y == 0:
        return x
    elif x < 0:
        return sum(x + 1, y - 1)
    else:
        return sum(x - 1, y + 1)

## This is a code block that calls the function and prints the result
let num1 = 5
let num2 = 10
let result = sum(num1, num2)
echo "The sum of " & $num1 & " and " & $num2 & " is " & $result
