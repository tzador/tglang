# Defining a procedure to calculate the factorial of a given number
# The procedure takes in a single parameter, `n`
proc factorial(n: int): int =
    var result = 1 # Initializing the variable `result` with value 1
    for i in 1..n:
        result *= i # Multiplying `result` by `i` on every iteration
    return result

# Printing the factorial of the number 7
echo factorial(7)
