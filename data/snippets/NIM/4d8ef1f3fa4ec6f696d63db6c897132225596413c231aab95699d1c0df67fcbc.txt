## This code snippet simulates a game of NIM

# Defining starting values
var n = 15 # Number of sticks in the pile
var turn = 1 # Tracks the current player's turn

# Game loop that ends when all sticks have been taken
while n > 0:

    # Printing the current state of the game
    echo "Sticks left:", n
    echo "Player", turn, "'s turn"

    # Getting the number of sticks the current player wants to take
    var choice: int = input("How many sticks do you want to take?")

    # Checking if the input is valid
    while choice > n or choice <= 0:
        choice = input("Invalid choice. Please choose a number between 1 and " & $n)

    # Updating the number of sticks left and the current player's turn
    n -= choice
    turn = if turn == 1: 2 else: 1

# Printing the winner
echo "Player ", if turn == 1: 2 else: 1, " wins!"
