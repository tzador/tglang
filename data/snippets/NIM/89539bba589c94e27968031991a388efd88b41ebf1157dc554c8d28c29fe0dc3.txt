# NIM (Not In My Name) is a declarative programming language that allows for interactive programming and easy creation of chatbots

# importing necessary modules
import asyncio
import json

# defining a function to create chatbot responses
proc chatbotResponse(input: string): auto =
  var responses = {"Hi": "Hello!", "How are you?": "I am functioning properly, thank you! How about you?"}

  # searching for a matching key in the 'responses' dictionary
  if input in responses:
    # returning the corresponding value
    return responses[input]
  else:
    # handling unknown input by returning a generic response
    return "I am sorry, I did not understand that."

# creating an infinite loop for the chatbot to run in
while true:
  # getting user input
  var userInput = input()

  # passing the input to the chatbot response function and printing the response
  echo(chatbotResponse(userInput))

  # adding a delay to simulate natural conversation
