##This code snippet generates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence

proc fibonacci(n: int): int =
    ##Create an array to store the sequence
    var sequence: array[0..n] of int

    ##Initialize the first two values in the sequence
    sequence[0] = 0
    sequence[1] = 1

    ##Use a loop to calculate the remaining values
    for i in 2..n:
        sequence[i] = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]

    ##Return the nth value in the sequence
    return sequence[n]

##Call the fibonacci() procedure and assign the result to a variable
var result = fibonacci(10)

##Print the result
echo "The 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence is ", result
