# This is a complex code snippet in NIM
# It calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

# Define a function for calculating factorial
proc factorial(n: int): int =
  if n == 0: # Base case
    result = 1
  else:
    result = n * factorial(n-1) # Recursively call the function
  return result

# Get user input for the number whose factorial is to be calculated
echo "Enter a number: "
var input = readLine(stdin)
let num = parseInt(input)

# Calculate and print the factorial
echo "Factorial of ", num, " is ", factorial(num)
