# This code snippet uses the Nim programming language

# Create a Nim set named "numbers" and add elements to it
var numbers: set[int] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Create a Nim sequence named "squares" and assign values to it
let squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Loop through the set and sequence, and print the result
for num in numbers:
  for sq in squares:
    echo "The square of", $num, "is", $sq + "\n"
