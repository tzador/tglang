# This code snippet is a demonstration of the
# NIM programming language's syntax and features.

# Importing the system module for system related functions

# Defining a custom type for a person
type
    Person = object
        name: string
        age: int
        country: string

# Creating a new instance of the Person type
var john: Person

# Defining a proc (procedure) to greet a person
proc greet(p: Person) =
    echo "Hello, " & p.name & " from " & p.country & "!"

# Populating the john object with data
john.name = "John Doe"
john.age = 30
john.country = "United States"

# Calling the greet proc and passing in the john object
greet(john)

# Defining a proc to print out a countdown
proc countdown(start: int) =
    for i in start.downto(1):
        echo i

# Calling the countdown proc with a starting value of 5
countdown(5)

# Defining an array of programming languages
var languages: seq[string] = @["Python", "Java", "C++", "NIM"]

# Looping through the array and printing out each language
for lang in languages:

# Defining a function to calculate the factorial of a number
