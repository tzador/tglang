# This is a simple program written in NIM.
# It calculates the sum of two numbers and prints the result.

# Define a function that takes in two integers and returns their sum
proc add(a: int, b: int): int =
    return a + b 

# Main function
proc main() =
    # Get input from user and convert it to integers
    echo "Enter first number: "
    let num1 = parseInt(readLine(stdin))
    echo "Enter second number: "
    let num2 = parseInt(readLine(stdin))

    # Call the add function
    # and store the result in a variable
    let result = add(num1, num2)

    # Print the result to the console
    echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $result"

# Call the main function
main()
