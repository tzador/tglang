# This program demonstrates the use of arrays and loops in NIM
# Declare an array of 10 elements
var
  arr: array[1..10] of int

# Use a loop to initialize the array
for i in 1..10:
  arr[i] = 2 * i

# Use another loop to print the elements of the array
for i in 1..10:
  echo arr[i]

# Use a while loop to find the sum of all even numbers in the array
var
  sum = 0
  index = 1
while index <= 10:
  if arr[index] % 2 == 0:
    sum += arr[index]
  index += 1

# Print the sum of even numbers in the array
echo "Sum of even numbers in the array: " & sum
