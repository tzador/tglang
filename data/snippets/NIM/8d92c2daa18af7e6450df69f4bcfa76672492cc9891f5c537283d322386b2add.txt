# This code snippet generates a random sequence of numbers and prints their sum
# Importing the random module
import random

# Declaring a list to store the sequence of numbers
var sequence: seq[int]

# Getting user input for the length of the sequence
echo "Enter the length of the sequence:"
let length = readLine(stdin)

# Converting the user input from string to integer
let num = parseInt(length)

# Using a for loop to generate the random sequence of numbers
for i in 0..<num:
  # Generating a random number between 1 to 100
  let random_num = random(1..100)
  
  # Appending the random number to the sequence list
  sequence.add(random_num)

# Declaring a variable to store the sum of the sequence
var sum = 0

# Using a for loop to iterate through the sequence and calculate the sum
for num in sequence:
  # Adding the current number to the sum
  sum += num

# Printing the sequence and its sum
echo "The sequence is: ", sequence
echo "The sum of the numbers is: ", sum
