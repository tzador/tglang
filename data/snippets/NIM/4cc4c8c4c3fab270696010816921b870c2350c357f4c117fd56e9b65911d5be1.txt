## This is a function that takes in a string and returns the length of the string
proc stringLength(s: string): int =
  var counter = 0 # initialize counter variable
  for c in s: # loop through each character in the string
    counter += 1 # add 1 to counter for each character
  result = counter # set the result to the final value of the counter
  return result # return the result

# Example usage
var s = "Hello, World!"
echo stringLength(s) # outputs 13
