# This is a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of the even and odd numbers in the array. 

proc sumOfEvenAndOddNumbers(arr: seq[int]): (int, int) =
    var sumOfEven = 0
    var sumOfOdd = 0
    for element in arr:
        if element mod 2 == 0:   # if the element is even
            sumOfEven += element # add the element to the sum of even numbers
        else:                    # if the element is odd
            sumOfOdd += element  # add the element to the sum of odd numbers
    return (sumOfEven, sumOfOdd) # return a tuple with the sums of even and odd numbers

# Example usage:
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let (evenSum, oddSum) = sumOfEvenAndOddNumbers(array)
echo "The sum of even numbers is " & $evenSum
echo "The sum of odd numbers is " & $oddSum

# Output:
# The sum of even numbers is 6
# The sum of odd numbers is 9
