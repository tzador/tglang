# Declaring a variable with type inference
var name = "John"

# You can also specify the data type
var age: int = 25

# Creating a procedure with parameters
proc printInfo(name: string, age: int) =
  echo "Name: ", name
  echo "Age: ", age

# Calling the procedure and passing arguments
printInfo(name, age)

# Declaring an array with fixed size
var numbers: array[5, int]

# Initializing array elements
numbers[0] = 1
numbers[1] = 2
numbers[2] = 3
numbers[3] = 4
numbers[4] = 5

# Declaring a for loop to iterate through the array
for i in 0 ..< numbers.high:
  echo numbers[i]

# Declaring a tuple with two elements of different types
var person: tuple[string, int] = ("Mary", 30)

# Accessing tuple elements
echo person[0] # Output: Mary
echo person[1] # Output: 30

# Declaring a while loop
var count = 0
while count <= 10:
  echo count
  count += 1

# Declaring a method with a return type
method calculateArea(length: int, width: int): int =
  return length * width

# Calling the method and assigning the return value to a variable
var area = calculateArea(4, 5)

# Checking for conditional statements with if-else
if area < 10:
  echo "Small area"
else if area >= 10 and area <= 20:
  echo "Medium area"
else:
  echo "Large area"
