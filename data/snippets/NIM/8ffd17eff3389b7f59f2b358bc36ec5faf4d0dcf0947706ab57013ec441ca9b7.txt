# This program calculates the nth Fibonacci number using memoization

var
  memo: array[0..100] of int # an array to store previously calculated values
  n, result: int # n will be the input providing the desired Fibonacci number and result will be the calculated value

# recursive function to get the nth Fibonacci number, using memoization for efficiency
func fibonacci(n: int): int =
  if n <= 1: # base cases, return 0 for 0 and 1 for 1
    result = n
  else: # if n is greater than 1, check if value has already been calculated and stored in memo array
    if memo[n] > 0:
      result = memo[n] # if yes, use stored value to save computation time
    else:
      result = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2) # if not, calculate value using recursion
      memo[n] = result # store calculated value in memo array for future use

# prompt user for input
echo "Enter the desired Fibonacci number:" # prints a message in console
readLine(n) # reads input from user and stores it in n variable
result = fibonacci(n) # calls the fibonacci function and assigns the result to result variable

# print result
echo "The Fibonacci number at position `n` is: `result`" # prints the result in console, using backticks to format n and result variables

# sample output for input n = 6:
# The Fibonacci number at position 6 is: 8
# because the 6th Fibonacci number is 8 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
