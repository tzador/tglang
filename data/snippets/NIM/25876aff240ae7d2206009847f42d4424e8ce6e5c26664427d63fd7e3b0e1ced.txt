## A function that calculates the factorial of a number
proc factorial(input: int): int =
    ## `result` contains the final output, initially set as 1
    var result = 1
    ## `index` represents the current number being multiplied
    for index in 1..input:
        ## `fact` stores the intermediate results
        var fact = index
        ## `result` is multiplied with `fact` until `index` is equal to `input`
        result = result * fact
    ## Returns the final result
    return result

## Function call with input value of 5
let num = factorial(5)

## Prints the result to the console
echo("The factorial of 5 is ", $num)
