# This is a code snippet in the programming language NIM
# It uses a for loop to print the sum of the numbers in a given range

var sum = 0    # variable to store the sum
let min = 1    # starting value of the range
let max = 10   # ending value of the range

for i in min..max:    # iterate through the range
    sum += i    # add the current number to the sum

echo "Sum of the numbers from ", min, " to ", max, " is ", sum
