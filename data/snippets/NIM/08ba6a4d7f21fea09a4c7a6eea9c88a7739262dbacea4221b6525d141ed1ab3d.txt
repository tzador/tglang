# This is a complex code snippet written in NIM programming language.
# It creates a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

# Define a procedure that takes in a number and returns its factorial
proc factorial(n: int): int =
    if n <= 1: 
        return 1
    else: 
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Define a function that takes in user input and calls the factorial procedure
func calculate_factorial(): void =
    var input: int = 0
    input = readInt()
    var result: int = factorial(input)

# Call the function to initiate the program
calculate_factorial()

# This is a print statement that outputs the result of the factorial calculation
echo $result
