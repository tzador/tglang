# Declare a sequence of integers

# Define a proc to calculate the factorial of a number
proc factorial(n: int): int =
    if n <= 1:
        # Return 1 if n is 0 or 1
        return 1

    # Recursively call the proc to calculate the factorial
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Declare a variable to store the sum of all factorials in the sequence
var sum: int

# Loop through the sequence of numbers
for num in numbers:
    # Calculate the factorial of each number
    var fact: int = factorial(num)

    # Add the factorial to the sum
    sum += fact

# Print the sum of all factorials
echo(sum)

# Output: 873
