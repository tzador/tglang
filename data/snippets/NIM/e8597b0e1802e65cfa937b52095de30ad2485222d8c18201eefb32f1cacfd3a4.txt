# This program calculates the sum of two numbers
proc sum(a: int, b: int): int =
    ## This proc takes two integers, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.
    return a + b

var num1 = 10 # first number to be added
var num2 = 5 # second number to be added

var result = sum(num1, num2) # calls the sum procedure and stores the returned value in `result`

echo "The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", result # prints the result to the console

## Output:
`The sum of 10 and 5 is 15`
