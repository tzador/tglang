# This program calculates the factorial of a number
# Input is taken from the user

# First, we define a function to calculate factorial
proc factorial(num: int): int =
    # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    if num == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive case: calculate factorial using previous factorials
    else:
        return num * factorial(num - 1)

# Next, we ask for user input and convert it to an integer
echo "Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "
var input: string = readLine()
var num: int = parseInt(input)

# Finally, we call the factorial function and output the result
echo "Factorial of " & $num & " is: "
echo factorial(num)
