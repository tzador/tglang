# This code snippet defines a procedure for finding the average of a given list of numbers
proc average(nums: seq[int]): float =
    # Initializing variables
    var sum = 0
    var count = 0

    # Looping through the list of numbers
    for num in nums:
        # Adding each number to the sum
        sum += num
        # Incrementing the count of numbers
        count += 1
    
    # Calculating the average
    result = sum / count

    # Returning the average
    return result

# Example usage
echo average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])    # Output: 3.0  (since 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and there are 5 numbers, the average is 3.0)
echo average([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])    # Output: 30.0  (since 10+20+30+40+50 = 150 and there are 5 numbers, the average is 30.0)
