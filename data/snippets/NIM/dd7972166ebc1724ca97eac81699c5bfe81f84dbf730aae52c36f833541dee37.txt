# This is a code snippet in NIM that generates a list of random numbers
# The list contains 10 elements, each element representing a random number between 1 and 1000

# Importing the random module
import random

# Defining a variable to store the number of elements in the list
var numElements = 10

# Defining an empty list to store the random numbers
var numList: seq[int]

# Looping through the specified number of elements
for i in 0..numElements:
    # Generating a random number using the 'random' module and adding it to the list
    numList.add(random.int(1,1000))

# Printing the list of random numbers
echo "List of random numbers: "
for num in numList:
    echo num
