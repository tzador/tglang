# This code snippet creates a new type called `Person` with various fields

type
  Person = object
    name: string          # field for person's name
    age: int              # field for person's age
    occupation: string    # field for person's occupation
    hobbies: seq[string]  # field for person's hobbies, represented as a sequence of strings
    favorite_books: Table[int, string] # field for person's favorite books, represented as a hash table with keys as book ID and values as book titles

# This code initializes a new `Person` object and sets the values for its fields

var
  user: Person = Person(
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 25,
    occupation: "Software Engineer",
    hobbies: @["hiking", "reading", "playing guitar"],
    favorite_books: {1401: "To Kill a Mockingbird", 2070: "1984"} # assigning values to the hash table using curly braces and colon to separate key-value pairs
  )

# This code snippet demonstrates how to access and modify the fields of the `Person` object

echo("Name: ", user.name) # accessing the `name` field using dot notation
echo("Hobbies: ", user.hobbies) # accessing the `hobbies` field, which is a sequence, using dot notation
user.occupation = "Data Scientist" # modifying the `occupation` field using dot notation
user.hobbies.add("baking") # adding a new hobby by using the `add` method on the `hobbies` sequence
user.favorite_books[1401] = "Pride and Prejudice" # modifying the value of a key in the hash table by using index notation

# This code snippet demonstrates how to loop through the `hobbies` sequence and print each hobby

for hobby in user.hobbies:
  echo(hobby)
