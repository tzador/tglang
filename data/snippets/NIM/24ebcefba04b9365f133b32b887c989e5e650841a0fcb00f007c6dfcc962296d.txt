## This is a code snippet in NIM
# It generates a random number and checks if it is divisible by 3 or 5, or both.
# If it is divisible by 3 or 5, it will print out the number and a corresponding message.

# Import the `random` module for generating random numbers
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 100
let randomNumber = random.randint(1,100)

# Check if the number is divisible by 3 or 5
if randomNumber mod 3 == 0:
    echo "The number ${randomNumber} is divisible by 3"
if randomNumber mod 5 == 0:
    echo "The number ${randomNumber} is divisible by 5"

# If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print it out without any message
echo "The number ${randomNumber}"

# Output:
# The number 87
# The number 65 is divisible by 5
