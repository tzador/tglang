# This code snippet is a demonstration of basic operators and control structures in NIM

# declare and initialize variables
var x = 5
var y = 10
var z = 3.14
var name = "John"

# arithmetic operations
var addition = x + y  # addition
var subtraction = x - y  # subtraction
var multiplication = x * y  # multiplication
var division = y / x  # division

# print results
echo "Addition: ", addition
echo "Subtraction: ", subtraction
echo "Multiplication: ", multiplication
echo "Division: ", division

# control structures
if x > y:
    echo "X is greater than Y"
elif x < y:
    echo "X is less than Y"
else:
    echo "X is equal to Y"
    
# loop
for i in 0..10:
    echo "Index: ", i
    
# printing strings and variables
echo "Hello, ", name, "! Your age is ", y, " and your favorite number is ", z
