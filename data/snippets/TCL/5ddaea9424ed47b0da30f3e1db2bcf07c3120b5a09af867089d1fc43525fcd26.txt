# An example of a complex Tcl script with variable assignment, conditional statements, and loops

# Variable declaration and initialization
set i 1
set sum 0

# While loop to iterate until i is less than or equal to 10
while {$i <= 10} {
    if {$i > 5} { # If statement to check if i is greater than 5
        set sum [expr {$sum + $i}] # Addition of i to the sum
    }
    set i [expr {$i + 1}] # Incrementing i by 1
}

# Output the final value of sum
puts "Sum of numbers from 6 to 10: $sum"

# For loop to iterate from 1 to 5
for {set j 1} {$j <= 5} {incr j} {
    set product [expr {$sum * $j}] # Multiplication of sum with j
    puts "Product of $sum and $j: $product"
