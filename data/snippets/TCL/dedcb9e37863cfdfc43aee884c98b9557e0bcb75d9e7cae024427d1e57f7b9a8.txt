# This is a code snippet in TCL
# It creates a list and performs operations on it

set originalList {1 2 3 4 5} ;# create a list with 5 elements

set newList [list] ;# create an empty list
set newList [linsert $newList 0 0] ;# insert 0 at index 0 of the empty list
set newList [linsert $newList end 6] ;# insert 6 at the end of the list
set newList [lreplace $newList 3 4 {7 8 9}] ;# replace elements at indices 3 and 4 with 7, 8 and 9

puts "Original list: $originalList" ;# prints: Original list: 1 2 3 4 5
puts "New list: $newList" ;# prints: New list: 0 1 2 7 8 9 6

set sum [lindex $newList 6] ;# get the last element of the list
set sum [expr {$sum + [lindex $newList 1] + [lindex $originalList 2]}] ;# perform arithmetic operations on elements of different lists

puts "Sum of last element of new list and second element of original list and third element of the list: $sum" ;# prints Sum of last element of new list and second element of original list and third element of the list: 12
