# This is a complex code snippet in TCL that calculates the factorial of a given number.

set num 5 ; # Initialize the variable num with the value 5

set fact 1 ; # Initialize the factorial variable to 1, this will be used to store the calculated factorial value

# Create a function to calculate the factorial
proc factorial {n} {
    set result 1 ; # Initialize the result variable to 1 to calculate the factorial
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {
        set result [expr {$result * $i}] ; # Multiply the current result with the value of i
    }
    return $result ; # Return the calculated factorial value
}

# Call the factorial function and store the returned value in the fact variable
set fact [factorial $num] ;

puts "Factorial of $num is $fact" ; # Print the factorial value to the console

# Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
