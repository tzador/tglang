# A procedure to compute the factorial of a given number

# Initialize the input variable 
set num 6

# Initialize the factorial variable
set factorial 1

# Loop through all numbers from 1 to the input number
for {set i 1} {$i <= $num} {incr i} {
    # Multiply the current factorial value by the current number
    set factorial [expr $factorial * $i]
}

# Print the factorial result
puts "The factorial of $num is: $factorial"
