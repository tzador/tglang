# A complex code snippet in TCL
# This code snippet uses a loop and a conditional statement to find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100

# Initialize variable for sum
set sum 0

# Loop through numbers 1 to 100
for {set i 1} {$i <= 100} {incr i} {

    # Check if number is even
    if {[expr $i % 2] == 0} {

        # Add number to sum
        set sum [expr $sum + $i]

    }
}

# Print out the sum
puts "The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is $sum"
