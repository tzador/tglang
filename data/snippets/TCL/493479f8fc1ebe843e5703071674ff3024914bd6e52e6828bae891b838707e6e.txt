# This is a code snippet in TCL that generates a random DNA sequence of length 50

# Create a list of nucleotides (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine)
set nucleotides {A C G T}

# Create empty string to store DNA sequence
set DNA ""

# Generate random numbers in the range of 0 to 3 (corresponding to the index of nucleotides)
for {set i 0} {$i < 50} {incr i} {

	# Generate random number between 0 to 3 and use it as index to get nucleotide
	set randomIndex [expr int(rand() * 4)]

	# Append nucleotide to DNA sequence
	append DNA [lindex $nucleotides $randomIndex]
}

# Print the generated DNA sequence
puts "Random DNA sequence: $DNA"
