# This is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming.

# This is a procedure called "fib" that takes in one argument, n.
# The body of the procedure starts with an if statement to check if n is less than 2.
# If n is less than 2, the procedure returns n. This covers the base cases of 0 and 1 in the sequence.
# If n is greater than or equal to 2, the procedure enters the else block.
# The procedure then sets two variables, prev1 and prev2, to 0 and 1 respectively.
# A for loop is used to iterate from the third element (index 2) up to the nth element of the sequence.
# Inside the for loop, the current element (i.e. the sum of the previous two elements) is calculated using the expr command.
# The value of prev1 is replaced with the previous value of prev2, and the value of prev2 is replaced with the current value.
# Once the for loop is done, the procedure returns the current value.

# This implementation uses dynamic programming to store previously calculated values, resulting in a more efficient solution.

# Example usage:
# fib 0 => 0
# fib 5 => 5
# fib 10 => 55
