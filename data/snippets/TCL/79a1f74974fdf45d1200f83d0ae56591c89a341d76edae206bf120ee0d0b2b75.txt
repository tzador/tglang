# Procedure for finding the average of a list of numbers
# Use inside other programs, accepts a list as its argument
proc find_average {number_list} {
    set sum 0 # Initialize sum to 0
    set count 0 # Initialize counter to 0
    foreach num $number_list { # Loop through the list
        set sum [expr {$sum + $num}] # Add each number to the sum
        incr count # Increment the counter
    }
    set average [expr {$sum / $count}] # Calculate the average
    return $average # Return the average
}

# Sample list of numbers
set numbers {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10}

# Call the find_average procedure and store the result in a variable
set average_number [find_average $numbers]

# Print the result
puts "The average of the list is $average_number"
