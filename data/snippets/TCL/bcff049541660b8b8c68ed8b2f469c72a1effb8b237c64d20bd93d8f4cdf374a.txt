# This block of code defines a procedure that takes in two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a list that contains the common elements between the two lists

proc findCommonElements {list1 list2} {
    set common_elements [list] 
    # Creates a new empty list to store the common elements

    foreach element $list1 {
        # Loops through each element in list1
        if {[lsearch $list2 $element] > -1} {
            # Uses the lsearch command to check if the element is present in list2 
            # If the element is present, its index in the list will be greater than -1
            lappend common_elements $element 
            # If the element is present in both lists, it is added to the common_elements list
        }
    } 
    return $common_elements 
    # Returns the list of common elements
}

# This block of code creates two lists and passes them as parameters to the findCommonElements procedure

set first_list [list "apple" "banana" "orange" "grape"] 
# Creates a list with string elements

set second_list [list 1 2 3 "banana" "grape"] 
# Creates a list with different data types (string and integer)

set common_list [findCommonElements $first_list $second_list] 
# Calls the findCommonElements procedure passing in the two lists
# The output will be a list containing the common elements "banana" and "grape"

# Output: {banana grape}
