# This is a program that performs a series of calculations and prints the results
# Declare the variables
set a 5
set b 10
set c 3
set d 7
set e 2

# Perform the calculations
set sum [expr $a + $b] # Calculates the sum of a and b
set difference [expr $c - $d] # Calculates the difference between c and d
set product [expr $b * $e] # Calculates the product of b and e
set quotient [expr float($d) / float($e)] # Calculates the quotient of d and e, casting to float to avoid integer division
set power [expr $a ** $e] # Calculates a raised to the power of e

# Print the results
puts "The sum of $a and $b is $sum"
