# Declare an array with 5 elements
set arr [list "element1" "element2" "element3" "element4" "element5"]

# Declare a procedure that takes two parameters and
# prints their sum
proc sum {num1 num2} {
    # Calculate the sum
    set result [expr {$num1 + $num2}]
    # Print the result
    puts "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $result"
}

# Call the procedure with two integer arguments
sum 12 5
# Output: The sum of 12 and 5 is 17

# Call the procedure with two floating point arguments
sum 5.5 3.2
# Output: The sum of 5.5 and 3.2 is 8.7

# Create a while loop that iterates 10 times
set i 0
while {$i < 10} {
    # Print the current iteration number
    puts "Current iteration: $i"
    # Increment i
    incr i
}
# Output:
# Current iteration: 0
# Current iteration: 1
# Current iteration: 2
# Current iteration: 3
# Current iteration: 4
# Current iteration: 5
# Current iteration: 6
# Current iteration: 7
# Current iteration: 8
# Current iteration: 9
