# Function to calculate the factorial of a number
proc factorial {n} {
    set factorial 1   # Initializing factorial to 1
    
    # Looping from 1 to n
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {
        set factorial [expr {$factorial * $i}]   # Calculating factorial
    }
    
    return $factorial   # Returning the factorial value
}

# Calling the factorial function and storing the result
set result [factorial 5]

# Printing the result
puts "Factorial of 5 is $result"

# Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
