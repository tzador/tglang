# This is a complex code snippet in TCL

# Set variables
set first_num 5
set second_num 10

# Create a procedure that multiplies two numbers
proc multiply {first second} {

    # Multiply the two numbers and store in result variable
    set result [expr $first * $second]

    # Print the result to the console
    puts "The result of multiplying $first and $second is $result"
    
    # Return the result
    return $result
}

# Call the multiply procedure and pass in the variables
set output [multiply $first_num $second_num]

# Print the output to the console
puts "The output is $output"
