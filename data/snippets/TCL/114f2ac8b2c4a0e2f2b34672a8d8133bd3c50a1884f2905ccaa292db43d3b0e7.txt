# This is a code that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion in TCL

# Define a procedure named factorial that takes a single argument
proc factorial {num} {
    # If the number is 0 or 1, return 1
    if {$num==0 || $num==1} {
        return 1
    }

    # Otherwise, return the factorial of the number by recursively calling the factorial procedure
    else {
        return [expr {$num * [factorial [expr $num-1]]}]
    }
}

# Take user input for the number
puts "Enter a number: "
set num [gets stdin]

# Call the factorial procedure and store the result in a variable
set result [factorial $num]

# Print the result
puts "The factorial of $num is $result"

# Expected Output:
# Enter a number: 5
# The factorial of 5 is 120
