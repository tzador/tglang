# This program demonstrates the use of nested loops and conditional statements in TCL

# Create a list of numbers

    set factorCount 0
    
    # Loop through numbers from 1 to the current number in the list
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $num} {incr i} {
        # Check if the current number is a factor of the original number
        if {$num % $i == 0} {
            # If it is, increment the factor count
            incr factorCount

    }
    
    # Check if the number has exactly two factors (1 and itself)
