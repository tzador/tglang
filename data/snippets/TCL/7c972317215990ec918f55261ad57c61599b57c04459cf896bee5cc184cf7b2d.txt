# This is a comment. The above code defines a procedure named "findFileExtension" that takes in a filename as a parameter and returns its file extension.
# It first uses the "upvar" command to create a reference to the value of the "filename" variable.
# Then it uses the "string last" command to find the index of the last occurrence of the "." character in the filename, which indicates the start of the file extension.
# The "ext" variable is then assigned the substring of "name" starting from the index of the "." plus one, which is the file extension.
# Finally, the procedure returns the file extension.

# To use this procedure, we can call it and pass in a filename as a parameter.
set filename "example.txt"
set extension [findFileExtension $filename]
# The "set" command assigns the output of the "findFileExtension" procedure to the "extension" variable.
# The value of "extension" should now be "txt", the file extension of "example.txt".
