#We create a new namespace called "myNamespace".
namespace eval myNamespace {

    #We define a variable within our namespace called "myVariable" and set its value to 5.
    set myVariable 5

    #We create a proc (procedure) within our namespace called "myProc" that takes in two arguments.
    proc myProc {arg1 arg2} {

        #We use the "set" command to manipulate the value of our variable within the proc.
        set myVariable [expr $myVariable + $arg1 - $arg2]

        #We use the "puts" command to print out a message to the console with the updated value.
        puts "The updated value of myVariable is $myVariable."
    }
}

#We call our proc within our namespace and pass in the arguments 2 and 3.
myNamespace::myProc 2 3

#The output will show "The updated value of myVariable is 4." since we added 2 and subtracted 3 from the original value of 5.
