# This is a code snippet in TCL language that calculates the factorial of a given number
# It takes in an input number from the user and uses a for loop to calculate the factorial
# The output is then printed to the console

proc factorial {num} { # defining a procedure called factorial with an input parameter 'num'
  set factorial 1 # initializing variable 'factorial' to 1
  for {set i 1} {$i <= $num} {incr i} { # using a for loop to iterate until the input number
    set factorial [expr $factorial * $i] # updating the factorial variable with the multiplication of current factorial and iterator 'i'
  }
  puts "The factorial of $num is $factorial" # printing the final factorial value to the console
}

set input [gets stdin] # taking user input from the console
set num [expr $input] # converting the user input into an integer
factorial $num # calling the factorial procedure with the input number as the argument
