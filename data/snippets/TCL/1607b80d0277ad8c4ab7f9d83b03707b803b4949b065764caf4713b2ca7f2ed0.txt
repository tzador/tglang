# This is a code snippet in TCL

# Defining a procedure that checks if a given number is odd or even
proc check_number {num} {

	# Using the modulo operator to check for remainder
	set remainder [expr $num % 2]

	# If the remainder is 0, the number is even
	if {$remainder == 0} {

		# Printing the output using puts command
		puts "The number $num is even."
	} else {

		# Printing the output using puts command
		puts "The number $num is odd."
	}
}

# Calling the procedure with a sample number
check_number 25

# Output:
# The number 25 is odd.
