#
# This code snippet is a defined procedure in TCL that performs a complex mathematical operation.
# It takes in two parameters, a list of numbers and an integer, and outputs a list containing the result of each number multiplied by the integer.
#
proc multiply_numbers {num_list num} {
    set result [list]
    foreach n $num_list {
        lappend result [expr {$n * $num}]
    }
    return $result
}
#
# Example usage of the multiply_numbers procedure.
#
set numbers {1 2 3 4 5}
set multiplier 10
set multiplied_numbers [multiply_numbers $numbers $multiplier]
# Output:
# [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
