# This is a comment in TCL
# Declare a variable num with value 10
set num 10

# Define a proc called factorial that takes a number as parameter
proc factorial {number} {
    # Initialize a variable result with value 1
    set result 1
    
    # Use a for loop to calculate factorial
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $number} {incr i} {
        # Multiply result with current number
        set result [expr {$result * $i}]
    }
    
    # Print the result
    puts "Factorial of $number is $result"
}

# Call the factorial proc with num as argument
factorial $num

# Output:
# Factorial of 10 is 3628800
