# Creating a list with four elements
set list {1 2 3 4}
# Looping through the list using a for loop
for {set i 0} {$i < [llength $list]} {incr i} {
    # Getting the current element
    set curr [lindex $list $i]
    # Printing the element and its index
    puts "Element at index $i: $curr"
}
# Output:
# Element at index 0: 1
# Element at index 1: 2
# Element at index 2: 3
# Element at index 3: 4
