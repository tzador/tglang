# A simple program in TCL that calculates the GCD of two numbers
# Define a procedure to calculate the GCD
proc gcd {a b} {
    # Set up variables to store the two numbers and the remainder
    set x $a
    set y $b
    set r [expr {$x % $y}]

    # Use a while loop to continuously divide the numbers until the remainder is 0
    while {$r != 0} {
        set x $y
        set y $r

        # Calculate the new remainder
        set r [expr {$x % $y}]
    }

    # Return the GCD as the value of the procedure
    return $y
}

# Prompt the user to input two numbers
puts "Enter two numbers to find their GCD:"
set num1 [gets stdin]
set num2 [gets stdin]

# Call the procedure with the two numbers as arguments
set result [gcd $num1 $num2]

# Print the result
puts "The GCD of $num1 and $num2 is $result"
