# This is a complex code snippet in TCL, a programming language that stands for Tool Command Language.

# First, we define a procedure called "getFactorial" that takes a number as input and calculates its factorial.

proc getFactorial {num} {
    if {$num == 0} { # if the input is 0, return 1
        return 1
    } else { # if the input is not 0, use recursion to calculate the factorial
        return [expr $num * [getFactorial [expr $num - 1]]]
    }
}

# Next, we set a variable "n" to 5 and call the "getFactorial" procedure with this variable as input.
set n 5
getFactorial $n

# This will return the output of 5 factorial, which is 120.

# Next, we define a list called "numbers" with integers ranging from 1 to 10.
set numbers [list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]

# Then, we use the "foreach" loop to iterate through the list and calculate the factorial of each number using our "getFactorial" procedure.
foreach num $numbers {
    getFactorial $num # the output for each iteration will be printed automatically
}

# Finally, we define a new procedure called "printMessage" that takes a message as input and prints it out with some formatting.
proc printMessage {message} {
    puts "--------MESSAGE--------" # add a separator for clarity
    puts $message # print the message
    puts "-----------------------" # add another separator
}

# We can now call this new procedure and provide a customized message to be printed.
printMessage "This is a custom message."

# The output will be:
--------
MESSAGE--------
This is a custom message.
