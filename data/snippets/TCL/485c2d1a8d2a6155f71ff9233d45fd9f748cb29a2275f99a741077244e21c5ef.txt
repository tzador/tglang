# This is a complex code snippet in TCL
# It creates a list of names and prints them in reverse order

# Define the list of names
set names {John, Mary, Adam, Samantha, David}

# Create a new list to store the names in reverse order
set reverse_names {}

# Use a for loop to iterate through the original list and add the names in reverse order to the new list
for {set i [expr [llength $names] - 1]} {$i >= 0} {incr i -1} { 
    lappend reverse_names [lindex $names $i] 
}

# Print the reversed list of names
puts "Reverse order of names: $reverse_names"

# Output:
# Reverse order of names: David Samantha Adam Mary John
