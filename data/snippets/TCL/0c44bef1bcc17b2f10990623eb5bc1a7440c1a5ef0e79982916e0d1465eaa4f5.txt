# This code snippet is a simple implementation of a selection sort algorithm in TCL.

# Create a list of numbers to be sorted
set numbers {5 3 8 2 9 1 4 7 6}

# Get the length of the list
set n [llength $numbers]

# Loop through the list
for {set current 0} {$current < $n} {incr current} {
    # Set the minimum index to be the current index
    set min_index $current

    # Loop through the remaining unsorted numbers
    for {set i [expr $current + 1]} {$i < $n} {incr i} {
        # Check if the current minimum is greater than the next number
        if {$numbers[$min_index] > $numbers[$i]} {
            # If so, update the minimum index
            set min_index $i
        }
    }

    # Swap the current minimum with the first unsorted number
    set temp $numbers[$current]
    set numbers[$current] $numbers[$min_index]
    set numbers[$min_index] $temp
}

# Print the sorted list
puts "Sorted list: $numbers"
