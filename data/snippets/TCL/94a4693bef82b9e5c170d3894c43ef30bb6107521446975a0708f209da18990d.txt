# This is a code snippet in TCL 
# The code snippet demonstrates a complex function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.
#
# Define the function "average"
proc average {numbers} {

    # Initialize the sum variable to 0
    set sum 0
    # Initialize the count variable to 0
    set count 0

    # Loop through each number in the list
    foreach num $numbers {

        # Increment the sum by the current number
        incr sum $num
        # Increment the count by 1
        incr count
    }

    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count
    set average [expr {$sum / $count}]

    # Return the average
    return $average
}

# Create a list of numbers to test the function
set num_list {4 5 6 7}

# Call the "average" function with the list of numbers as the argument
average $num_list
