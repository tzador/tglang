# This is a complex code snippet in TCL
# It generates a list of numbers and performs mathematical operations on them

set numbers {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10}  ;# creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10
set sum 0                         ;# initialize sum variable to 0
set product 1                     ;# initialize product variable to 1

foreach num $numbers {            ;# for each number in the list
    incr sum $num                ;# add the number to the sum variable
    set product [expr {$product * $num}]      ;# multiply the number with the product variable
}

puts "The sum of the numbers is $sum"  ;# print the sum
puts "The product of the numbers is $product"  ;# print the product
