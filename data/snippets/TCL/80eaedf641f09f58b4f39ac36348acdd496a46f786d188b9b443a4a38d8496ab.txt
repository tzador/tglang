# Define a procedure that takes in two numbers and returns their sum
proc sum {a b} {
    return [expr $a + $b]
}

# Define a list of numbers
set numbers {1 2 3 4 5}

# Loop through the list and call the sum procedure for each pair of numbers
foreach number $numbers {
    set result [sum $number 10]
    puts "$number + 10 = $result"
}

# Output:
# 1 + 10 = 11
# 2 + 10 = 12
# 3 + 10 = 13
# 4 + 10 = 14
# 5 + 10 = 15
