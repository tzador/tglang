# This is a code snippet in TCL, a high-level scripting language used for automation, prototyping, and testing.
# In this example, we will create a simple Guessing Game program.

# Define a variable for the secret number
set secret_num 7

# Define a variable for the user's guess
set user_guess ""

# Define a variable for the number of attempts
set num_attempts 0

# Create a while loop to run the game until the user guesses the right number or runs out of attempts
while {$user_guess != $secret_num && $num_attempts < 5} {
    
    # Ask for user input and save it in the user_guess variable
    puts "Guess a number between 1 and 10: "
    gets stdin user_guess
    
    # Convert the user's guess to an integer
    set user_guess [expr {$user_guess + 0}]

    # Increment the number of attempts
    incr num_attempts 

    # Check if the user's guess is too low, too high, or correct
    if {$user_guess < $secret_num} {
        puts "Too low! Try again."
    } elseif {$user_guess > $secret_num} {
        puts "Too high! Try again."
    } else {
        puts "Congratulations! You guessed the right number in $num_attempts attempts."
    }
}

# Check if the user ran out of attempts without guessing the right number
if {$num_attempts == 5} {
    puts "Sorry, you ran out of attempts. The secret number was $secret_num."
}
