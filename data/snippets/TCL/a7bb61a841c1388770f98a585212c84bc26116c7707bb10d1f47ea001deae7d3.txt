# This is a code snippet in TCL

# Define a list
set numList {1 2 3}

# Define a procedure to calculate the sum of elements in the list
proc sum {numList} {
    set sum 0

    # Loop through the elements in the list
    foreach num $numList {
        # Add each element to the sum
        set sum [expr $sum + $num]
    }

    # Print the result
    puts "The sum of the elements in this list is $sum"
}

# Call the procedure sum
sum $numList

# Output:
# The sum of the elements in this list is 6
