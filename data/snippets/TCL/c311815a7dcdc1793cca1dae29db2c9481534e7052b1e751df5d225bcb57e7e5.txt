# This is a comment in TCL
# This program calculates the sum of the squares of all numbers from 1 to 10, using a for loop

# Define a variable 'sum' to store the final result, and initialize it with a value of 0
set sum 0

# Use the for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10
for {set i 1} {$i <= 10} {incr i} {

    # Calculate the square of the current number 'i' and store it in the variable 'square'
    set square [expr $i * $i]

    # Add the square to the sum
    set sum [expr $sum + $square]
}

# Print the final result
puts "The sum of squares from 1 to 10 is: $sum"
