# This is a complex code snippet in TCL

# Define a variable
set num 5

# Define a procedure to calculate the factorial of a number
proc factorial {n} {
    set result 1
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {
        set result [expr $result * $i]
    }
    return $result
}

# Call the factorial procedure with the variable as the argument
set result [factorial $num]

# Print out the result
puts "The factorial of $num is $result"

# Output:
# The factorial of 5 is 120
