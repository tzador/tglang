# This is a sample code snippet in TCL
# It creates a dictionary with keys and values, loops through the dictionary
# and prints out the key-value pairs in a formatted string
# Initialize the dictionary
set fruits {
  apple "red and green"
  banana "yellow"
  orange "orange"
}

# Loop through the dictionary
foreach {fruit color} $fruits {
  # Create a formatted string using the key-value pairs
  set formatted_str "The $fruit is $color."

  # Print out the formatted string
  puts $formatted_str
}

# Output:
# The apple is red and green.
# The banana is yellow.
# The orange is orange.
