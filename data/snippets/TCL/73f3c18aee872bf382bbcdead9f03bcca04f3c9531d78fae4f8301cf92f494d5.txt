# This code snippet demonstrates how to create a list in TCL and iterate through its elements #

# Create a list containing strings and integers #
set myList {"apple" 1 "banana" 2 "orange" 3}

# Create a variable to keep track of the index #
set index 0

# Iterate through the list using a while loop #
while {$index < [llength $myList]} {

    # Get the value at current index #
    set value [lindex $myList $index]

    # Check if the value is an integer #
    if {[string is digit $value]} {

        # If it is an integer, print its square root #
        puts "Square root of $value is [expr {sqrt($value)}]"
    } else {

        # If it is a string, print its length #
        puts "Length of $value is [string length $value]"
    }

    # Increment the index #
    incr index
}
