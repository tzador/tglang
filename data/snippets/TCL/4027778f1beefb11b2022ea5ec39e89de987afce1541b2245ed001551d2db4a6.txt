# This is a complex code snippet in TCL
# It uses various built-in functions and commands to manipulate data and create output

# Create a variable to store a list of numbers
set numbers {4 9 2 7 5}

# Apply a function to the list to find the sum of all the numbers
set sum [tcl::mathop::+ {*}$numbers]

# Create a new list to store the squared values of the numbers
set square_list {}

# Loop through the original list and square each number
foreach num $numbers {
    set squared [expr $num * $num]
    lappend square_list $squared
}

# Calculate the average of the squared numbers
set square_avg [tcl::mathop::/ 1.0 [tcl::mathop::+ {*}$square_list]]

# Print the results
puts "Original list of numbers: $numbers"
puts "Sum of numbers: $sum"
puts "List of squared numbers: $square_list"
puts "Average of squared numbers: $square_avg"

# Output:
# Original list of numbers: 4 9 2 7 5
# Sum of numbers: 27
# List of squared numbers: 16 81 4 49 25
# Average of squared numbers: 35.0
