#This code snippet generates a list of all odd numbers between 1 and 100 and squares each number.

#Define an empty list to store the squared odd numbers
set squared_nums {}

#Start a for loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to 100
for {set i 1} {$i <= 100} {incr i} {

    #Check if the current number is odd
    if {$i % 2 == 1} {

        #Square the number and add it to the list
        lappend squared_nums [expr {$i * $i}]
    }
}

#Print the list of squared odd numbers
puts "List of squared odd numbers: $squared_nums"
