# This program uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number

proc factorial {n} { # define a procedure called factorial that takes in one argument (n)
    if {$n == 1} { # base case: if n == 1, return 1
        return 1
    } else { # recursive case: if n > 1, multiply n by the factorial of n-1
        return [expr { $n * [factorial [expr {$n-1}]]}]
    }
}

set num 5 # set a variable called num to the value 5
puts "Factorial of $num is [factorial $num]" # print the result of the factorial function with num as the argument

# Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
