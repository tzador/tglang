# Define a procedure to print the Fibonacci sequence
proc fibonacci {n} {

	# Initialize variables for the first two numbers in the sequence
	set first 0
	set second 1

	# Loop through n numbers
	for {set i 0} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {

		# Print the current number in the sequence
		puts $first

		# Calculate the next number
		set next [expr $first + $second]

		# Update the first and second variables
		set first $second
		set second $next
	}
}

# Call the procedure with a value of 10
fibonacci 10
