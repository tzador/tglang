# Example code in TCL

# Define procedure to calculate the average of a list of numbers
proc calculate_avg {numList} {
    set sum 0  # Initialize sum variable to 0
    set count 0  # Initialize count variable to 0

    foreach num $numList {  # Loop through each number in the list
        incr sum $num  # Add current number to sum
        incr count  # Increment count by 1
    }

    set avg [expr {$sum / $count}]  # Calculate average by dividing sum by count
    return $avg
}

set numbers {1 2 3 4 5}  # Define list of numbers
set average [calculate_avg $numbers]  # Call calculate_avg procedure
puts "The average of $numbers is $average"  # Print result to console
