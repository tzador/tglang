# This is a code snippet in TCL
# It creates a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations

# Function to perform addition operation
proc add {a b} {
    set result [expr $a + $b]
    return $result
}

# Function to perform subtraction operation
proc subtract {a b} {
    set result [expr $a - $b]
    return $result
}

# Function to perform multiplication operation
proc multiply {a b} {
    set result [expr $a * $b]
    return $result
}

# Function to perform division operation
proc divide {a b} {
    # Check for division by zero
    if {$b == 0} {
        puts "Error: Cannot divide by zero"
        return
    }
    set result [expr $a / $b]
    return $result
}

# Main program
# Get user input
puts "Enter the first number: "
gets stdin num1
puts "Enter the second number: "
gets stdin num2

# Perform operations and display the result
puts "Sum: [add $num1 $num2]"
puts "Difference: [subtract $num1 $num2]"
puts "Product: [multiply $num1 $num2]"
puts "Quotient: [divide $num1 $num2]"
