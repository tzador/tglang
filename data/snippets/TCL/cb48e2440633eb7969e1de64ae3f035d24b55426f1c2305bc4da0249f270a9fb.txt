# Define a variable with the value 5
set number 5

# Define a proc (procedure) that takes in two parameters
# and returns the product of the two numbers
proc product {num1 num2} {
    set result [expr $num1 * $num2]
    return $result
}

# Define a proc that takes in three parameters
# and prints out the sum of the three numbers
proc sum {num1 num2 num3} {
    set result [expr $num1 + $num2 + $num3]
    puts "The sum of the three numbers is $result."
}

# Call the product proc with the value of 5 and 10
set multiplied [product 5 10]

# Call the sum proc with the values of 2, 3, and 5
sum 2 3 5

# Output:
# The sum of the three numbers is 10.
