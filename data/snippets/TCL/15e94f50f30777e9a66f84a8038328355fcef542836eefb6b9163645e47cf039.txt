# This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a number
proc factorial {n} {
    # set the initial value of the factorial to 1
    set result 1

    # loop through all the numbers from 1 to n
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {

        # multiply the current result by the current number
        set result [expr {$result * $i}]
    }

    # return the final result
    return $result
}

# define a variable
set num 5

# call the factorial function with the variable as input
set factorial_result [factorial $num]

# print out the result
puts "The factorial of $num is $factorial_result"

# output: The factorial of 5 is 120
