# This is a complex code snippet in TCL for calculating the average of a list of numbers

# First, we define a procedure that takes in a list of numbers as an argument
proc calc_avg {numbers} {
    
    # We initialize the sum variable as 0 to start the calculation
    set sum 0
    
    # We use a loop to iterate through the list of numbers
    foreach num $numbers {
        
        # For each number, we add it to the sum variable
        set sum [expr $sum + $num]
    }
    
    # Now we calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list
    set avg [expr $sum / [llength $numbers]]
    
    # Finally, we return the average value
    return $avg
}

# To test our procedure, we create a list of numbers
set numbers {4 7 2 9 5}

# We call our calc_avg procedure and pass in the list of numbers
set average [calc_avg $numbers]

# We print out the result using the puts command
puts "The average of the numbers [join $numbers " "] is: $average"

# Output: The average of the numbers 4 7 2 9 5 is: 5.4
