# This code snippet uses the built-in tcllib HTTP package to make a GET request to a specified URL
#
# First, import the necessary libraries
package require http
package require base64
package require uri

# Set the URL to make the GET request to
set url "https://example.com/get-data"

# Create a dictionary object to hold any custom headers for the request
set headers {}
# Add a custom header for authorization using Base64 encoding
dict set headers "Authorization" [base64::encode "username:password"]

# Encode any query parameters needed for the request
set params [uri::composeQuery [list param1 value1 param2 value2]]

# Make the GET request using the http::get command from the http package
set response [http::get $url -query $params -headers $headers]

# Check the response status code to make sure the request was successful
if {[lindex $response 0] == 200} {
    # Get the response body from the response returned by the http::get command
    set body [lindex $response 2]
    # Display the response body
    puts "Response: $body"
} else {
    # If the request was not successful, display the error message
    puts "Error: [lindex $response 2]"
}
