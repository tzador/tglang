# This is a TCL program that creates a new variable for storing a list of numbers
set list {1 2 3 4 5}

# We can loop through the list using the "foreach" command and print out each element
foreach num $list {
  puts "Number: $num"
}
# Output:
# Number: 1
# Number: 2
# Number: 3
# Number: 4
# Number: 5
