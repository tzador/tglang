# This code snippet is a basic TCP server program

# Create a socket object for server communication
set server_socket [socket -server accept 5000]

# Define a callback procedure for incoming connections
proc accept {sock addr port} {
    puts "Accepted connection from $addr on port $port"
    # Read data from client
    set data [read $sock]
    # Echo the data back to client
    puts $sock $data
    flush $sock
    # Close the connection
    close $sock
}

# Enter a loop to accept and handle incoming connections
while {1} {
    # Wait for an incoming connection and invoke the accept procedure
    vwait server_socket
}
