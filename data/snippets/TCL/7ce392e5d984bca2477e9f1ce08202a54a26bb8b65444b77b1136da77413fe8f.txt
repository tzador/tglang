# This is a comment in TCL

# This is a procedure (function) called "sum" that takes in two arguments, a and b
# It returns the sum of a and b
proc sum {a b} {
    # Initialize a variable called "result" to store the sum
    set result 0

    # Add a and b together and store the result in "result"
    set result [expr {$a + $b}]

    # Return the value of "result"
    return $result
}

# Example call for the "sum" procedure, passing in the numbers 5 and 10
set total [sum 5 10]

puts $total ; # Output: 15
