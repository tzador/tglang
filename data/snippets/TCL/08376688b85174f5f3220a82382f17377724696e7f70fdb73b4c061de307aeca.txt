# This code snippet shows how to create a nested list in TCL

# Create a list of fruits
set fruits [list "apple" "banana" "orange"]

# Create a list of vegetables
set vegetables [list "carrot" "tomato" "lettuce"]

# Create a list of desserts
set desserts [list "cake" "ice cream" "cookies"]

# Create a nested list of food by combining the three lists
set food [list $fruits $vegetables $desserts]

# Print the nested list
puts "Food: $food"

# Output:
# Food: {{apple banana orange} {carrot tomato lettuce} {cake ice cream cookies}}
