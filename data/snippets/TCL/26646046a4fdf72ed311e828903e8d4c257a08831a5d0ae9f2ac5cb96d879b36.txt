# This code snippet is a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
proc factorial {num} {
  # Check if number is equal to 0 
  if {$num==0} {
    # If true, return 1 as the factorial of 0
    return 1
  } else {
    # If number is not 0, use recursion to calculate the factorial
    # Multiply the number with the factorial of the number - 1
    return [expr $num * [factorial [expr $num - 1]]]
  }
}

# Call the function and print the factorial of 5
puts [factorial 5]

# Output: 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)
