# Annotated TCL code snippet
# This code defines a procedure that computes the factorial of a given number
proc factorial {n} {

    # set the initial value of the factorial to 1
    set fact 1

    # loop through all the numbers from 1 to n, and multiply by the factorial variable 'fact'
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {

        # multiply the current value of 'fact' by the current iteration number 'i'
        set fact [expr $fact * $i]
    }

    # return the factorial value
    return $fact
}

# call the procedure with a value of 5
factorial 5
