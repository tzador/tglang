# Procedure to calculate factorial of a given number
proc factorial {n} {
    # Initialize the factorial variable
    set factorial 1
    # Loop to multiply each number from 1 to n
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {
        # Multiplying the factorial variable with the current number
        set factorial [expr $factorial * $i]
    }
    # Return the factorial value
    return $factorial
}

# Example usage
puts [factorial 5]
