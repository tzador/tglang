# Create a list with starting values
set numbers {1 2 3 4}

# Define a procedure to square each number in the list
proc square {list} {

    # Create an empty list to store the squared values
    set squared_list {}

    # Loop through each number in the original list
    foreach num $list {

        # Square the number
        set squared [expr $num * $num]

        # Add the squared number to the new list
        lappend squared_list $squared
    }

    # Return the new list with squared values
    return $squared_list
}

# Call the square procedure with the original list and store the result in a variable
set squared_numbers [square $numbers]

# Print the original list
puts "Original list: $numbers"

# Print the squared list
puts "Squared list: $squared_numbers"

# Output:
# Original list: 1 2 3 4
# Squared list: 1 4 9 16
