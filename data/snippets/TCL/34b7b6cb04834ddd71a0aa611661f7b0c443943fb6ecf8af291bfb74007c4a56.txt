# This is a TCL code snippet that uses a for loop to print out all the prime numbers between 1 and 1000

# Start of for loop
for {set i 2} {$i <= 1000} {incr i} {
  
  # Initialize a variable to keep track of whether a number is prime or not
  set is_prime 1
  
  # Check if current number is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root
  for {set j 2} {$j <= [expr int(sqrt($i))]} {incr j} {
    # If number is divisible, set is_prime to 0 and break out of loop
    if {($i % $j) == 0} {
      set is_prime 0
      break
    }
  }
  
  # Check if is_prime is still 1, meaning the number is prime
  if {$is_prime} {
    # Print the prime number
    puts $i
  }
}

# End of for loop
