if {$x > 5} { ;# checks if x is greater than 5
  puts "x is a large number" ;# prints a message if condition is met
} elseif {$x < 0} { ;# checks if x is less than 0
  puts "x is a negative number" ;# prints a message if condition is met
} else {
  puts "x is between 0 and 5" ;# prints a message if neither condition is met
