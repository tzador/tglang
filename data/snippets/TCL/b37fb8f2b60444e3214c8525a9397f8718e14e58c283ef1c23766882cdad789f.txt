# The following code snippet is in TCL and creates a function that takes in two arguments, x and y, and returns the sum of x and y.
# It first declares the function name and the arguments that it will take in.
proc sum {x y} {
    # The following line creates a local variable 'sum' and assigns it the value of x plus y.
    set sum [expr {$x + $y}]

    # This line returns the value of the local variable 'sum' as the output of the function.
    return $sum
}

# The following line calls the function with arguments of 5 and 10, storing the output in the variable 'result'.
set result [sum 5 10]

# This line prints the value of the variable 'result', which should be 15.
puts $result
