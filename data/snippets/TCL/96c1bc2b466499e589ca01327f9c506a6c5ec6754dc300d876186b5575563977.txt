# This is a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number

# Define a function with one parameter, n
proc factorial {n} {
    # Check if n is equal to 0
    if {$n == 0} {
        # If so, return 1
        return 1
    }
    # Otherwise, use recursion to continue calculating the factorial of n-1
    # The result of the recursion will be multiplied by n
    # For example, factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3) = 4 * 3 * factorial(2) = 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
    return [expr {$n * [factorial [expr {$n-1}]]}]
}

# Call the factorial function and store the result in a variable
set result [factorial 5]

# Print the result
puts "The factorial of 5 is $result" 

# Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
