# Define a procedure to calculate the factorial of a number

proc factorial {num} {
    if {$num == 0} {
        return 1
    } else {
        return [expr $num * [factorial [expr $num - 1]]]
    }
}

# Call the procedure and store the result in a variable

set result [factorial 5]

# Print the result

puts "The factorial of 5 is $result"

# Output:
# The factorial of 5 is 120
