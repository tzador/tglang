## This is a code snippet in TCL

set numbers [list 1 2 3 4 5 6]

foreach num $numbers {
    if {$num % 2 eq 0} {
        set squared [expr {$num * $num}]
        puts "The square of $num is $squared."
    } else {
        puts "$num is not an even number."
    }
}

## Output:
## The square of 2 is 4.
## 1 is not an even number.
## The square of 4 is 16.
## 3 is not an even number.
## The square of 6 is 36.
