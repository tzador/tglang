# This code snippet creates a function to calculate the average of three numbers

proc average {num1 num2 num3} {
    # Stores the sum of the three numbers
    set total [expr $num1 + $num2 + $num3]
    
    # Calculates the average by dividing the total by three
    set average [expr $total / 3.0]
    
    # Prints the average with a precision of two decimal places
    puts "The average of $num1, $num2, and $num3 is: [format "%.2f" $average]"
}

# Calls the average function with numbers 5, 10, and 15 as arguments
average 5 10 15

# Output: The average of 5, 10, and 15 is: 10.00
