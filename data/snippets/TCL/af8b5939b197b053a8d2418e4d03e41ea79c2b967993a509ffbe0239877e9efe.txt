# Annotated Code Snippet in TCL
# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user

# creates a procedure named "factorial" that takes in one parameter "num"
proc factorial {num} {
    # sets the initial value of "result" to 1
    set result 1
    # creates a for loop that iterates from 1 to the input number "num"
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $num} {incr i} {
        # multiplies the current value of "result" by the value of "i"
        set result [expr $result * $i]
    }
    # returns the final value of "result" as the factorial of "num"
    return $result
}

# prompts the user to enter a number and stores it in the variable "input"
puts "Enter a number:"
gets stdin input

# calls the "factorial" procedure with the input number as the argument and stores the result in "output"
set output [factorial $input]

# prints the result to the console
puts "The factorial of $input is $output"
