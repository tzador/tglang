# This is a sample code snippet in TCL.
# It creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, squares each number, and then prints the sum of all squares.

# Initialize an empty list to store numbers
set numlist [list]

# Use a for loop to add numbers 1 to 10 to the list
for {set i 1} {$i <= 10} {incr i} {
  lappend numlist $i
}

# Use a foreach loop to square each number in the list
foreach num $numlist {
  set sq [expr $num * $num]
  lset numlist [lsearch $numlist $num] $sq
}

# Use the lreduce command to sum all of the squares in the list
set sum [lreduce {acc num} {$acc + $num} $numlist]

# Print the sum of all squares
puts "Sum of squares: $sum"

# Output: Sum of squares: 385
