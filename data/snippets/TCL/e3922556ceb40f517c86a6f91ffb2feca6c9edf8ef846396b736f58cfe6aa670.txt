# This is a code snippet that creates and sorts a list of numbers in TCL.

# Define a procedure that takes in a list of numbers, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.
proc sort_numbers {numbers} {
    set sorted_numbers [lsort $numbers]
    return $sorted_numbers
}

# Define a list of numbers to be sorted.
set numbers_to_sort {5 2 8 1 9 4 3 7 6}

# Call the sort_numbers procedure and pass in the numbers to be sorted.
set sorted_numbers [sort_numbers $numbers_to_sort]

# Print out the sorted list of numbers.
puts "Sorted numbers: $sorted_numbers"

# Output:
# Sorted numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
