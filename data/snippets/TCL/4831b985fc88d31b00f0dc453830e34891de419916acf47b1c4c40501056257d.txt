# Define a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum
proc sum {num1 num2} {

# Call the function with two integers as arguments
set num1 5
set num2 10
puts "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is [sum $num1 $num2]."  # Prints "The sum of 5 and 10 is 15."

# Define a while loop that counts from 1 to 10
set i 1
while {$i <= 10} {
