# Defining a variable called "name" and assigning it a value
set name "John"

# Defining a list variable called "numbers"
set numbers {2 4 6}

# Defining a proc (procedure) called "add_numbers" that takes in two parameters
proc add_numbers {num1 num2} {
  # Summing the two parameters together and assigning it to a variable called "total"
  set total [expr $num1 + $num2]

  # Printing out the result
  puts "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $total"
}

# Calling the "add_numbers" proc with the "numbers" variable as the two parameters
add_numbers $numbers

# Output:
# The sum of 2 and 4 is 6
# The sum of 4 and 6 is 10
