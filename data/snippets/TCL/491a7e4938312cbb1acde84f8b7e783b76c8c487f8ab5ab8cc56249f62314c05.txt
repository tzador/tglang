# Define a variable named "message" and assign a string value to it
set message "Hello, World!"

# Print the message to the console
puts $message

# Define a procedure called "double" that takes one argument "num"
proc double {num} {
    # Multiply the argument by 2 and store it in a variable called "result"

    # Print the result to the console
    puts "The double of $num is $result"
    
    # Return the result
    return $result
}

# Call the procedure and pass in the value 5 as the argument
double 5

# Define a list with integer values
set numbers {2 5 10 14}

# Use a for loop to iterate over the list
