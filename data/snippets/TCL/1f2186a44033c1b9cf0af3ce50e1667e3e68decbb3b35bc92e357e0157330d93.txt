# Here we are creating a proc (procedure) in TCL that takes in two parameters, adds them together and then prints out the result
proc add_numbers {a b} {
    # We are using set to assign the sum of a and b to the variable 'sum'
    set sum [expr $a + $b]
    # We are then printing out the result using puts
    puts "The sum of $a and $b is $sum."
}
# Here we are calling the add_numbers procedure with the values 5 and 10 as arguments
add_numbers 5 10
# Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.
