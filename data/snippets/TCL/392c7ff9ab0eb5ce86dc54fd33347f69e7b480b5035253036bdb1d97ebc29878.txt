# This is a code snippet in TCL language.
# It is used to create a function named "calculate_average" that takes in a list of numbers.
proc calculate_average {numbers} {
  # Initializing variables to store the sum and the number of elements in the list.
  set sum 0
  set count 0
  # Using a for loop to iterate through the list.
  for {set i 0} {$i < [llength $numbers]} {incr i} {
    # Adding the current element to the sum and incrementing the count variable.
    set sum [expr $sum + [lindex $numbers $i]]
    incr count
  }
  # Calculating the average by dividing the sum by the count.
  set average [expr $sum / $count]
  # Returning the calculated average.
  return $average
}

# Example usage of the calculate_average function.
# Creating a list of numbers.
set num_list {5 10 15 20 25}
# Calling the function and storing the returned average in a variable.
set avg [calculate_average $num_list]
# Printing the result.
puts "Average of $num_list is: $avg"
