# A complex code snippet in TCL that creates a dictionary
# and prints out its values after modifying them

# Create a dictionary with some key-value pairs
set my_dict [dict create 
    name "John Doe" 
    age 25
    occupation "Software Engineer"
    hobbies {"Reading" "Painting" "Photography"}
    ]

# Modify the name and age values
dict set my_dict name "Jane Doe"
dict set my_dict age 30

# Loop through the dictionary and print the key-value pairs
foreach {key value} [dict getall my_dict] {
    puts "$key: $value"
}

# Output:
