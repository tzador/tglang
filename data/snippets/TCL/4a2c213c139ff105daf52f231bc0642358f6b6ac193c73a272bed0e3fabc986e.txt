# Define a variable "num" and assign a value of 5
set num 5
# Define a procedure named "sum"
proc sum {a b} {
    # Calculate sum of variables a and b
    set result [expr $a + $b]
    # Print the result
    puts "The sum of $a and $b is $result"
}
# Call the "sum" procedure with inputs 10 and $num (5)
sum 10 $num
