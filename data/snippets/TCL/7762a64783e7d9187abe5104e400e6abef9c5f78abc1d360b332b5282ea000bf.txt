#This is a code snippet written in TCL

#Define a procedure for calculating the factorial of a given number
proc factorial {n} {

    #Define a variable to hold the factorial value
    set result 1

    #Loop through all the numbers from 1 to the given number
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {

        #Multiply the current factorial value with the current number
        set result [expr {$result * $i}]
    }

    #Return the factorial value
    return $result
}

#Call the factorial procedure with the number 5
factorial 5

#Output:
# The factorial of 5 is 120.
