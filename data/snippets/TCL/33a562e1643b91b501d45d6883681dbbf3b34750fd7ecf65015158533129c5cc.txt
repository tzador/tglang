# Define a procedure to calculate the factorial of a number
proc factorial {n} {

    # Initialize a variable to store the factorial value
    set result 1

    # Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {

        # Multiply the result by the current value of i
        set result [expr {$result * $i}]
    }

    # Return the final result
    return $result
}

# Call the factorial procedure with a value of 5 and print the result
puts [factorial 5]
