# This code snippet demonstrates the use of a for loop and conditional statements in Tcl

# Define a list of numbers
set numbers {1 2 3 4 5}

# Initialize a variable to store the sum of even numbers in the list
set even_sum 0

# Loop through the numbers list
for {set i 0} {$i < [llength $numbers]} {incr i} {

    # Get the number at the current index
    set num [lindex $numbers $i]

    # Check if the number is even
    if {$num % 2 == 0} {

        # Add the number to the even_sum variable
        set even_sum [expr $even_sum + $num]
    }
}

# Output the sum of even numbers
puts "The sum of even numbers in the list is: $even_sum"

# Output an empty line
puts ""

# Initialize a variable to store the factorial of a number
set factorial 1

# Get input from the user for the number
puts "Enter a number to calculate its factorial:"
gets stdin num

# Convert the input to an integer
set num [expr $num * 1]

# Check if the number is negative
if {$num < 0} {

    # Output an error message
    puts "Factorial of a negative number is not defined."
}

# Check if the number is zero
if {$num == 0} {

    # Output 1 as the factorial of 0
    puts "Factorial of 0 is 1."
}

# Check if the number is positive
if {$num > 0} {

    # Loop from 1 to the number
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $num} {incr i} {

        # Calculate the factorial
        set factorial [expr $factorial * $i]
    }

    # Output the factorial
    puts "Factorial of $num is $factorial."
