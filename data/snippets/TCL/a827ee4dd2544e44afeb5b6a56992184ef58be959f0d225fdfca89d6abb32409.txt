# This is a comment that explains the purpose of the following code
proc add_numbers {num1 num2} { # This is a procedure that takes two arguments, num1 and num2
    set result 0 # Initializing the variable result to 0
    while {$num2 > 0} { # Starting a while loop that runs as long as num2 is greater than 0
        incr result $num1 # Incrementing the result by the value of num1
        incr num2 -1 # Decrementing num2 by 1 to eventually reach 0 and end the loop
    }
    return $result # Returning the final value of result
}

set number1 5 # Assigning value 5 to variable number1
set number2 3 # Assigning value 3 to variable number2

add_numbers $number1 $number2 # Calling the function and passing in the arguments
# Output should be 8, as 5 + 3 = 8
