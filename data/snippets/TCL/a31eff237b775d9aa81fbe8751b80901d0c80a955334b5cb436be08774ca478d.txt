# Example of a complex code snippet in TCL

proc add {x y} {
    # Defines a procedure called 'add' which takes in 2 arguments x and y

    set result [expr $x + $y]
    # Calculates the sum of x and y and stores it in a variable 'result'

    return $result
    # Returns the value of 'result' as the output of the add procedure
}

set num1 5
set num2 10
# Defines two variables num1 and num2 and assigns them values 5 and 10 respectively

set total [add $num1 $num2]
# Calls the add procedure and passes in num1 and num2 as arguments, storing the result in a variable 'total'

puts "The total is $total"
# Prints out the value of 'total' in a user-friendly message
