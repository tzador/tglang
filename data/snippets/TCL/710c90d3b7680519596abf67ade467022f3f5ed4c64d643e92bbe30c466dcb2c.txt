# This code snippet will create a nested list using TCL programming language
# The outermost list will contain three elements, each being another list
set nestedList {{1 2 3} {"cat" "dog"} {True False}}

# Iterate through the outer list
foreach element $nestedList {
    # Check if the element is a list
    if {[llength $element] > 1} {
        # If it is a list, iterate through the inner list
        foreach innerElement $element {
            # Print each inner element with a space in between
            puts -nonewline "$innerElement "
        }
        # Print a new line after each inner list is printed
        puts ""
    } else {
        # If the element is not a list, print it directly with a space in between
        puts -nonewline "$element "
    }
}

# The output will be:
# 1 2 3
# cat dog
# True False
