set device_name "Cisco Router"

# Define device IP address
set device_ip "192.168.1.1"

# Define credentials for device
set username "user1"
set password "pass123"

# Open SSH connection to device
spawn ssh $username@$device_ip

# Expect password prompt and send password
expect {
    "Password:" {
        send "$password\r"
    }
}

# Expect router prompt
expect {
    "Router>" {
        # Send command to check status
        send "show interface status\r"
    }
}

# Expect output from status command
expect {
    -re "Gi.*|Fa.*" {
        # Print interface status
        puts "The status of $device_name interface is: $expect_out(0,string)"
    }
}
