# This is a complex TCL code snippet that calculates the factorial of a given number

# Define a procedure called factorial that takes in the input number
proc factorial {number} {
    # If the input number is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1
    if {$number == 0 || $number == 1} {
        return 1
    } else {
        # Otherwise, use recursion to calculate the factorial
        # Multiply the input number with the factorial of the number-1
        return [expr {$number * [factorial [expr {$number - 1}]]}]
    }
}

# Request user input for the number to calculate factorial
puts "Enter a number:"
set num [gets stdin]

# Call the factorial procedure with the input number and print the result
set result [factorial $num]
puts "The factorial of $num is $result"
