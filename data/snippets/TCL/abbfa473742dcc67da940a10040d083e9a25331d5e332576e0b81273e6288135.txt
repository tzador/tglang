# This is a simple program in TCL that calculates the factorial of a given number

# Function to calculate factorial
proc factorial {num} {
    if {$num <= 1} { # base case
        return 1
    } else {
        set fact 1 # initialize factorial to 1
        for {set i 1} {$i <= $num} {incr i} { # loop from 1 to given number
            set fact [expr $fact * $i] # multiply current factorial with current number
        }
        return $fact # return the final factorial value
    }
}

# Input number
set number 5

# Call the factorial function and store the result in a variable
set result [factorial $number]

# Print the result
puts "The factorial of $number is $result"

# Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
