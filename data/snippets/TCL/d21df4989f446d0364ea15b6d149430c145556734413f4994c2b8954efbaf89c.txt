# This is a complex code snippet in TCL
# This code displays a list of all prime numbers between 1 and 100.

# Store prime numbers in a list
set primes [list]

# Loop from 2 to 100
for {set i 2} {$i <= 100} {incr i} {

    # Set flag to indicate if number is prime
    set isPrime 1

    # Loop through all numbers from 2 to i - 1
    for {set j 2} {$j < $i} {incr j} {

        # Check if number is divisible by any previous number
        if {$i % $j == 0} {
            set isPrime 0; # If it is, set flag to false and break out of loop
            break
        }
    }

    # If number is prime, add it to the list
    if {$isPrime == 1} {
        lappend primes $i
    }
}

# Print out the list of prime numbers
puts "The prime numbers between 1 and 100 are: $primes"

# Output:
# The prime numbers between 1 and 100 are: {2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97}
