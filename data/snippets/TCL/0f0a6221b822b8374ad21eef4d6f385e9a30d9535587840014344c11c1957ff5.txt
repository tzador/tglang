# Welcome to my TCL code snippet!

# First, we define a variable called 'name' and assign it a string value
set name "John"

# Next, we define a list with multiple elements
set fruits [list "apple" "banana" "orange"]

# We can access elements of a list using the 'lindex' command
# We'll store the first and last element of the fruits list in variables
set first_fruit [lindex $fruits 0]
set last_fruit [lindex $fruits end]

# Now, we'll loop through the fruits list and print out each element
foreach fruit $fruits {
    puts "$name loves $fruit"
}

# We'll also add an 'if' statement to check if the last fruit in the list is an orange
if {$last_fruit == "orange"} {
    puts "$name's favorite fruit is $last_fruit"
} else {
    puts "$name's favorite fruit is not an orange"
}

# Finally, we'll create a procedure that takes in a number as input and squares it
proc square {num} {
    set squared [expr {$num * $num}]
    return $squared
}

# We'll call the procedure and print its output
set result [square 5]
puts "$name's favorite number squared is $result"
