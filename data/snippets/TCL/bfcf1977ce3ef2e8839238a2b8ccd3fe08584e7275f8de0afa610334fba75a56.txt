#This code snippet creates a list and performs various operations on it

#Create a list of numbers
set numbers {1 2 3 4 5}

#Add a number to the end of the list
lappend numbers 6

#Remove the first element from the list
set numbers [lrange $numbers 1 end]

#Loop through the list and print each element
foreach num $numbers {
    puts $num
}

#Find the index of a specific element
set index [lsearch $numbers 4]

#Check if a certain element exists in the list
set exists [lsearch -exact $numbers 7]
if {$exists >= 0} {
  puts "7 exists in the list"
} else {
  puts "7 does not exist in the list"
}

#Replace an element at a specific index with a new value
lset numbers 2 10

#Sort the list in ascending order
set sorted_numbers [lsort -integer $numbers]

#Reverse the list
set reversed_numbers [lreverse $numbers]

#Get the length of the list
set length [llength $numbers]

#Print the final list and its length
puts "Final List: $numbers"
puts "Length of List: $length"
