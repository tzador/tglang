# Define a procedure named factorial that takes in a number and calculates its factorial
proc factorial {n} {
    # Set the initial result to 1
    set result 1
    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {
        # Multiply the result by the current number
        set result [expr {$result * $i}]
    }
    # Return the final result
    return $result
}

# Call the factorial procedure and pass in the number 5
factorial 5

# Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
