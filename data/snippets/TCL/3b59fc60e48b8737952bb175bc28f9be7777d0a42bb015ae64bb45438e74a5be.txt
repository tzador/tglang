# This code snippet is a TCL script that creates a list of numbers, sorts it,
# and computes the average using a while loop.

# Define a variable to store the list of numbers
set numbers {3 5 2 1 7 4}

# Sort the list in ascending order using the `lsort` command
set sorted_numbers [lsort -integer $numbers]

# Initialize variables for sum and count
set sum 0
set count 0

# Create a while loop to iterate through the sorted list
while {$count < [llength $sorted_numbers]} {

    # Add the current number to the sum
    set sum [expr {$sum + [lindex $sorted_numbers $count]}]

    # Increment the count
    incr count
}

# Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements
# in the list
set average [expr {$sum / [llength $sorted_numbers]}]

# Print the sorted list and the average
puts "Sorted numbers: $sorted_numbers"
puts "Average: $average"
