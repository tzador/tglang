# This is a comment in TCL

# Define a TCL procedure for calculating the factorial of a given number
proc factorial {n} {
    # Initialize the result variable
    set result 1
    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {
        # Multiply the result by the current number
        set result [expr {$result * $i}]
    }
    # Return the final result
    return $result
}

# Example usage of the factorial procedure
set number 5
puts "Factorial of $number is [factorial $number]"

# Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
