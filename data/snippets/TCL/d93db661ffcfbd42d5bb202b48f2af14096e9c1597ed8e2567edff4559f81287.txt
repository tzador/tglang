# This is a code snippet in TCL.
# It creates a list of even numbers from 2 to 20 and then prints them in reverse order.

# Define a procedure called 'getEvens' with two parameters 'start' and 'end'
proc getEvens { start end } {

  # Create an empty list variable
  set evens [list]

  # Use a for loop to iterate from start to end with a step size of 2
  for {set i $start} {$i <= $end} {incr i 2} {

    # Append the current value of 'i' to the 'evens' list
    lappend evens $i
  }

  # Return the reverse of the 'evens' list using the built-in 'lreverse' command
  return [lreverse $evens]
}

# Call the 'getEvens' procedure with starting number '2' and ending number '20'
getEvens 2 20

# Output:
# 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2
