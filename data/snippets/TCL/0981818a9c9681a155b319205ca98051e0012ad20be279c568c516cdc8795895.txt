# Define a procedure to calculate the factorial of a number
proc factorial {num} {
  # Initialize a variable to store the factorial
  set result 1

  # Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers
  for {set i 2} {$i <= $num} {incr i} {
  
    # Multiply the result by the current number
    set result [expr {$result * $i}]
  }

  # Return the factorial value
  return $result
}

# Call the factorial procedure with input as 5 and display the output
puts "The factorial of 5 is [factorial 5]"
# Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
