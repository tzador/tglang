# This code snippet uses Tcl, a high-level, general-purpose programming language.

# Defines a procedure that accepts two parameters and returns their product
proc multiply {num1 num2} {
    return [expr {$num1 * $num2}]  # 'expr' is used to evaluate mathematical expressions in Tcl
}

# Defines a procedure that accepts a list of numbers and returns their average
proc average {numbers} {
    set sum 0  # Start with sum = 0
    foreach num $numbers {
        set sum [expr {$sum + $num}]  # Add each number in the list to the sum
    }
    return [expr {$sum / [llength $numbers]}]  # Divide the sum by the length of the list to get the average
}

# Create a list of numbers
set nums {2 4 6 8 10}

# Call the 'multiply' procedure with two numbers and print the result
set result [multiply 5 3]
puts "The result is $result"  # Output: The result is 15

# Call the 'average' procedure with the list of numbers and print the result
set avg [average $nums]
puts "The average is $avg"  # Output: The average is 6
