# Define a procedure that prints out a message based on a given number
proc print_message {num} {
    if {$num > 10} {
        # If the number is greater than 10, print out a message
        puts "The number is greater than 10!"

        # If the number is less than or equal to 10, print out a different message
        puts "The number is less than or equal to 10."
    }
}

# Call the procedure with different arguments
print_message 5; # Output: The number is less than or equal to 10.
print_message 15; # Output: The number is greater than 10!

# Define a list of animals
set animals {dog cat bird elephant}

# Use a for loop to iterate through the list and print out each animal
for {set i 0} {$i < [llength $animals]} {incr i} {
    puts "Animal number $i: [lindex $animals $i]"
}
# Output:
# Animal number 0: dog
# Animal number 1: cat
# Animal number 2: bird
# Animal number 3: elephant

# Create a dictionary with names and ages
set people {
    "Bob" 25
    "Jane" 30

}

# Use a foreach loop to iterate through the dictionary and print out each name and age
foreach {name age} $people {
    puts "$name is $age years old."
}
# Output:
# Bob is 25 years old.
# Jane is 30 years old.
# Mike is 40 years old.
# Sarah is 35 years old.
