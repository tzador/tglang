set num1 5
set num2 10
set result [expr {$num1 + $num2}]
puts "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is: $result."
# The code above sets two variables 'num1' and 'num2' to 5 and 10 respectively,
# and then performs a calculation using the 'expr' command to add these two variables.
# The result is stored in a third variable 'result'.
# Finally, the 'puts' command is used to print a string that includes the values of the variables and the calculated result.
# Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is: 15.
