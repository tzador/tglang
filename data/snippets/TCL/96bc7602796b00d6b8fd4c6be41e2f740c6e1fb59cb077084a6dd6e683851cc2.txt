# This is a comment in TCL
# Let's define a proc (procedure) that will take in two parameters and add them together
proc add_two_numbers {num1 num2} {

    # Define a variable to store the sum of the two numbers
    set sum [expr {$num1 + $num2}]

    # Print out the result
    puts "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum"
}

# Call the proc with two input numbers
add_two_numbers 5 10

# Output:
# The sum of 5 and 10 is 15
