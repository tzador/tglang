# This is a long and complex code snippet in TCL

# Declare a variable
set num 25

# Create a list of numbers
set numbers {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10}

# Use a for loop to iterate through the list
for {set i 0} {$i < [llength $numbers]} {incr i} {

    # If the current number is less than or equal to the declared variable, print a message
    if { [lindex $numbers $i] <= $num } {
        puts "The number [lindex $numbers $i] is less than or equal to $num"
    } else {
        # Otherwise, print a different message
        puts "The number [lindex $numbers $i] is greater than $num"
    }
}

# Create a procedure to check if a number is prime or not
proc is_prime {n} {
    # Set a flag to true
    set flag 1

    # Loop through all numbers from 2 to the number itself
    for {set i 2} {$i < $n} {incr i} {
        # Check if the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself
        if {$n % $i == 0} {
            # If yes, set flag to false and break out of the loop
            set flag 0
            break
        }
    }

    # Check the flag value and return a message accordingly
    if {$flag == 1} {
        return "$n is a prime number"
    } else {
        return "$n is not a prime number"
    }
}

# Call the is_prime procedure with a number and print the result
puts [is_prime 17]

# Output:
# The number 1 is less than or equal to 25
# The number 2 is less than or equal to 25
# The number 3 is less than or equal to 25
# The number 4 is less than or equal to 25
# The number 5 is less than or equal to 25
# The number 6 is less than or equal to 25
# The number 7 is less than or equal to 25
# The number 8 is less than or equal to 25
# The number 9 is less than or equal to 25
# The number 10 is less than or equal to 25
# 17 is a prime number
