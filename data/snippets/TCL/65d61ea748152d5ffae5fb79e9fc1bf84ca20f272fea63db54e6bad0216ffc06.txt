# This code snippet is written in the Tcl programming language
# It creates a simple function that calculates the average of a list of numbers
proc average {list_of_numbers} {
    # Define variables for sum and number of elements in the list
    set sum 0
    set count 0
    # Loop through the list of numbers and add each element to the sum
    foreach num $list_of_numbers {
        # Check if the current element is a number
        if {$num is number} {
            # Add the element to the sum
            set sum [expr $sum + $num]
            # Increment the count
            set count [expr $count + 1]
        }
    }
    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements
    set average [expr $sum / $count]
    # Print the average to the console
    puts "The average of the list is: $average"
}

# Call the average function with a list of numbers
average {5 10 15 20 25}
