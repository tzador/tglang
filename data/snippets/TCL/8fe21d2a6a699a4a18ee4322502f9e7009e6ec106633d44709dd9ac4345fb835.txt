set num1 10           ;# Assigning the value 10 to the variable num1 using the set command
set num2 20           ;# Assigning the value 20 to the variable num2
if {$num1 > $num2} {  ;# Using an if statement to compare the values of num1 and num2
    puts "num1 is greater than num2" ;# Printing the result if the condition is true
} else {              ;# If the condition is false
    puts "num2 is greater than num1" ;# Print a different result
}
while {$num1 < $num2} { ;# Using a while loop to execute the code block repeatedly while the condition is true
    puts "num1 is now $num1" ;# Print the current value of num1
    incr num1           ;# Increment the value of num1 by 1
}
# The code will print "num1 is now 10" and "num1 is now 11" since 11 is greater than 10 and the loop will terminate when num1 becomes 11.
