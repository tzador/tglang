# Example of complex code snippet in TCL

# Define a procedure that takes in two parameters and prints their product

proc print_product {num1 num2} {

    # Condition to check if both parameters are numbers
    if {![string is double -strict $num1] || ![string is double -strict $num2]} {
        puts "ERROR: Both parameters must be numeric values."
        return
    }

    # Multiply the two numbers and store result in a variable
    set product [expr {$num1 * $num2}]

    # Condition to check if product is greater than 100
    if {$product > 100} {
        puts "The product of $num1 and $num2 is greater than 100."
    } else {
        puts "The product of $num1 and $num2 is $product."
    }
}

# Call the procedure with two numeric parameters
