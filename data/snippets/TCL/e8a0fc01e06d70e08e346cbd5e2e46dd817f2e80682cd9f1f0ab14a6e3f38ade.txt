# Define a procedure that takes in two parameters, num1 and num2
proc add {num1 num2} {

  # Set a local variable, result, to hold the sum of num1 and num2
  set result [expr {$num1 + $num2}]

  # Print the result to the console
  puts "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $result"

  # Return the result
  return $result
}

# Call the proc with the values 5 and 7
add 5 7
