# This is a comment in TCL
# This code snippet shows an example of a procedure in TCL
# It takes in two parameters, a and b, and returns their sum
proc add {a b} {
	# perform variable substitution within curly braces
	set sum [expr {$a + $b}]
	
	# print out the sum in a formatted string using 'puts' command
	puts "The sum of $a and $b is $sum"
	
	# return the sum as the result of the procedure
	return $sum
}

# calling the add procedure with argument values of 5 and 7
add 5 7

# Output:
# The sum of 5 and 7 is 12
