# Defining a variable
set num 10

# Creating a procedure
proc factorial {n} {
    # Setting base case
    if { $n <= 1 } {
        return 1
    }
    
    # Recursive call
    set result [expr {$n * [factorial [expr {$n - 1}]]}] 
    
    # Returning result
    return $result
}

# Calling the procedure and printing the output
puts "The factorial of $num is [factorial $num]"

# Output: The factorial of 10 is 3,628,800
