# Define a procedure to calculate the factorial of a number 
proc factorial {n} {
    # Initialize a variable for storing the result
    set result 1
    # Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {
        # Update the result by multiplying it with the current number
        set result [expr {$result * $i}]
    }
    # Return the factorial as a string
    return [string cat "The factorial of " $n " is " $result]
}
# Call the procedure with different numbers to test it
puts [factorial 5] ;# Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
puts [factorial 8] ;# Output: The factorial of 8 is 40320
puts [factorial 1] ;# Output: The factorial of 1 is 1
puts [factorial 0] ;# Output: The factorial of 0 is 1
puts [factorial 10] ;# Output: The factorial of 10 is 3628800
