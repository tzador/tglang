### Code to calculate the mean of a list of numbers ###
proc mean {numlist} {
    set sum 0                     # initialize sum variable to 0
    set count [llength $numlist]  # determines the length of the list
    foreach num $numlist {        # start looping through each number in list
        set sum [expr {$sum + $num}]    # add each number to sum
    }
    set mean [expr {$sum/ $count}]       # calculate mean by dividing sum by count
    return $mean                  # return the mean
}

# Example usage
set numbers {5 10 15 20}
set result [mean $numbers]       # calls the mean function with numbers list
puts "The mean is $result"       # prints output "The mean is 12.5"
