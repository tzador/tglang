# This is a complex code snippet in TCL.

# Define a list of fruits.
set fruit_list [list "apple" "orange" "banana"]

# Create a procedure to print each fruit in the list, with its length and index.
proc print_fruits {fruits} {
    set i 0
    foreach fruit $fruits {
        puts "Index: $i \nFruit: $fruit \nLength: [string length $fruit]"
        incr i 1
    }
}

# Call the function to print the fruits.
print_fruits $fruit_list

# Output:
# Index: 0 
# Fruit: apple 
# Length: 5
# Index: 1 
# Fruit: orange 
# Length: 6
# Index: 2
# Fruit: banana 
# Length: 6
