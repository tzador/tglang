# This is a code snippet in TCL that creates a simple calculator
# This snippet takes two arguments, num1 and num2, and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them

    puts "Sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum"             # Prints the result in the specified format

    # Subtraction
    set diff [expr {double($num1) - double($num2)}]   # Converts the arguments to double and subtracts them, stores the result in "diff" variable
    puts "Difference between $num1 and $num2 is $diff" # Prints the result in the specified format

    # Multiplication
    set product [expr {double($num1) * double($num2)}] # Converts the arguments to double and multiplies them, stores the result in "product" variable
    puts "Product of $num1 and $num2 is $product"      # Prints the result in the specified format

    # Division
    if {$num2 == 0} {                                 # Checks if the second argument is 0, if yes then prints an error message
