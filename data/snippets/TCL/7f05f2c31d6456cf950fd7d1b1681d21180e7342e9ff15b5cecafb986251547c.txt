# This is a code snippet in TCL that creates a Fibonacci sequence and prints it to the console
set num1 0 ; # initialize the first number in the sequence
set num2 1 ; # initialize the second number in the sequence

puts "The Fibonacci sequence up to 100:" ; # print a heading to the console

while {$num2 <= 100} { # while loop to generate the sequence up to 100
    puts $num1 ; # print the current number in the sequence
    set temp $num1 ; # store the current number in a temporary variable
    set num1 $num2 ; # set the first number equal to the second number
    set num2 [expr {$temp + $num2}] ; # calculate the next number in the sequence
}

# Output:
The Fibonacci sequence up to 100:
