# This is a complex code snippet written in TCL
# It creates a variable called 'numbers' and assigns a list of even numbers to it
set numbers {2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20}

# It then creates a procedure that takes in the 'numbers' list and a number
proc check_number {numbers number} {

    # First, it loops through the list using the 'foreach' command
    # It assigns each element in the list to the variable 'n'
    foreach n $numbers {

        # It then checks if the current element is equal to the given number
        # If it is, it prints a message and breaks out of the loop using the 'break' command
        if {$n == $number} {
            puts "Number $number is in the list!"
            break
        }
    }

    # Finally, if the number is not found in the list, it prints a different message
    puts "Number $number is not in the list."
}

# Calling the procedure with different numbers to test
