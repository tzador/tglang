# Example code in TCL

# Define a variable 'x' and set it to the value 10
set x 10

# Define a procedure that prints the value of 'x'
proc printX {} {
    puts "The value of x is $x"
}

# Call the procedure to print the value of 'x'
printX

# Create a list containing numbers 1 to 5
set numbers {1 2 3 4 5}

# Iterate through the list using a for loop
for {set i 0} {$i < [llength $numbers]} {incr i} {
    # Multiply each number by 2 and store it back in the list
    set numbers [lreplace $numbers $i $i [expr {[lindex $numbers $i] * 2}]]
}

# Print the updated list
puts "The list is now $numbers"
