# This is a complex code snippet in TCL
#! /usr/bin/tcl

# define a procedure that takes in two arguments
proc factorial {x} {
    # assign a variable to the argument
    set fact 1
    # loop through all the numbers from 1 to the argument
    for {set i 1} {$i <= $x} {incr i} {
        # multiply the result by the current number
        set fact [expr $fact * $i]
    }
    #return the factorial value
    return $fact
}

# call the procedure and print the result
puts "Factorial of 5 is [factorial 5]" 
# this will output:
# Factorial of 5 is 120

# define a list variable
set fruits {apple banana mango orange}

# loop through the list and print each element
foreach fruit $fruits {
    puts "I love eating $fruit!"
}
# this will output:
# I love eating apple!
# I love eating banana!
# I love eating mango!
# I love eating orange! 

# define a dictionary variable
set colors {
    red "#FF0000"
    green "#00FF00"
    blue "#0000FF"
}

# loop through the dictionary and print each key-value pair
foreach {key value} [array get colors] {
    puts "Color $key has code $value."
}
# this will output:
# Color red has code #FF0000.
# Color green has code #00FF00.
# Color blue has code #0000FF.

# define a math function
proc math_func {x y} {
    expr {($x ** $y) + (2 * $x) - $y} 
}

# call the math function and print the result
puts [math_func 5 2] 
# this will output:
# 33
