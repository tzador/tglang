# This is a code snippet in TCL
# It contains a procedure that uses multiple control structures and variables

# Create a procedure called "sum_squared"
# It takes in two parameters, num1 and num2

}

# Call the procedure and pass in two numbers as arguments
set result [sum_squared 5 10]    ;# Use the "set" command to assign the returned value to the variable "result"
