# This is a code snippet in TCL
# It demonstrates iterating and printing a list of numbers

# Define a list of numbers
set numbers {1 2 3 4 5}

# Loop through the numbers list
foreach num $numbers {
    # Calculate the square of the current number
    set square [expr $num * $num]

    # Print the square with formatting
    puts "The square of $num is [format "%.2f" $square]"
}
