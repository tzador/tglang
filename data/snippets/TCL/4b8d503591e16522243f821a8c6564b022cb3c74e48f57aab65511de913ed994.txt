# This is a long and complex code snippet in TCL
# It includes variable assignments, arithmetic operations, and nested loops

# Assign a value to the variable x
set x 10

# Use the value of x in arithmetic operations
set y [expr $x + 5]
set z [expr $x - 5]

# Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
set numbers [list]
for {set i 1} {$i <= 10} {incr i} {
    lappend numbers $i
}

# Nested loop to print out the multiplication table
for {set row 1} {$row <= 10} {incr row} {
    for {set col 1} {$col <= 10} {incr col} {
        set product [expr $row * $col]
        puts "$row x $col = $product"
    }
}

# Use if statement to print out message based on condition
if {$z == 5} {
    puts "The value of z is 5"
} elseif {$z < 5} {
    puts "The value of z is less than 5"
} else {
    puts "The value of z is greater than 5"
}
