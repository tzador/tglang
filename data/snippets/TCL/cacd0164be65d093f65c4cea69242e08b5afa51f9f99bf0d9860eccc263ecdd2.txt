# This is a code snippet written in TCL
# It creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10 and prints out their squares
# using a for loop and conditional statements

# Create a list of numbers
set numbers {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10}

# Initialize a counter variable
set count 0

# Loop through the list of numbers
for {set i 0} {$i < [llength $numbers]} {incr i} {
    # Get the current number from the list
    set number [lindex $numbers $i]

    # Calculate the square of the number
    set square [expr $number * $number]

    # Check if the square is less than 50
    if {$square < 50} {
        # Print out the number and its square
        puts "$number squared is $square"
    } else {
        # Increment the counter variable
        incr count

        # Print out an error message
        puts "Error: $square is greater than 50"
    }
}

# Print out the total number of numbers with squares less than 50
puts "Total numbers with squares less than 50 is $count"
