# This is a code snippet in TCL, a scripting language used in many applications and devices
# It creates a procedure that takes in two parameters and multiplies them together
# The output is the result of the multiplication

proc multiply {num1 num2} {
    # set a variable to store the product
    set product 0
    # create a loop to multiply num1 by num2
    for {set i 0} {$i < $num2} {incr i} {
        # use the incr function to increase num1 by 1 each iteration
        incr num1
        # add num1 to the product variable
        set product [expr {$product + $num1}]
    }
    # return the product variable
    return $product
}

# call the multiply procedure and assign the result to a variable
set result [multiply 3 4]
# print the result to the console
puts $result

# Output:
# 12
