## This code snippet creates a TCL procedure that calculates the factorial of a given number
proc factorial {n} {
    ## set the result variable to 1 
    set result 1
    ## check if the number is smaller than or equal to 1
    if {$n <= 1} {
        ## return 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
        return 1
    } else {
        ## loop through all numbers from 2 to n and multiply them with the result
        for {set i 2} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {
            set result [expr {$result * $i}]
        }
        ## return the final result after the loop
        return $result
    }
}

## call the factorial procedure and store the result in the 'answer' variable
set answer [factorial 5]
## print the result to the console 
puts "The factorial of 5 is $answer"
