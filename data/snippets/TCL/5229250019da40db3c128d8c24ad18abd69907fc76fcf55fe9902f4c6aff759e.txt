# Sample code snippet in TCL
# This code calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

# Define a procedure for factorial
proc factorial {n} {
	# Base case, if n is 0 return 1
	if {$n == 0} {
		return 1
	}
	# Recursive case, call the factorial procedure with n-1
	return [expr $n * [factorial [expr $n-1]]]
}

# Define a variable to hold the input number
set number 6
# Call the factorial procedure with the input number
set result [factorial $number]
# Print the result
puts "The factorial of $number is $result"
