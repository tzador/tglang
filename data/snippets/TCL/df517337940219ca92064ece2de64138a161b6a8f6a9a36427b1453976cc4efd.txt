# This code snippet creates a Fibonacci sequence and prints it to the console

# Define the number of terms in the sequence
set n 10

# Initialize the variables for the first two terms
set a 0
set b 1

# Print the first two terms
puts $a
puts $b

# Loop through the remaining terms
for {set i 2} {$i < $n} {incr i} {
  # Calculate the next term by adding the previous two terms
  set c [expr {$a + $b}]

  # Print the next term
  puts $c

  # Shift the values to calculate the next term in the next loop iteration
  set a $b
  set b $c
