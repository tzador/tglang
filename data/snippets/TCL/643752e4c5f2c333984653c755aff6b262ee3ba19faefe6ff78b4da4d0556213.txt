# This is a basic example code snippet in TCL

# Define a procedure to calculate the factorial of a number
# The 'n' parameter is the number for which the factorial will be calculated
proc factorial {n} {
    # Initialize the 'result' variable to hold the final result
    set result 1
    # Loop from 'n' down to 1, multiplying each number by the previous one
    for {set i $n} {$i > 1} {incr i -1} {
        # Update the 'result' variable with the product of 'i' and the current 'result'
        set result [expr {$result * $i}]
    }
    # Return the final 'result' value
    return $result
}

# Define a variable to hold the number whose factorial we want to calculate
set num 5

# Call the 'factorial' procedure and store its result in the 'factorial_num' variable
set factorial_num [factorial $num]

# Print the result to the console
puts "The factorial of $num is $factorial_num"
