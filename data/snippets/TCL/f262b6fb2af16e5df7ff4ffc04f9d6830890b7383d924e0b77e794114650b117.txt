# Define a variable "number" and assign a value of 10
set number 10
# Define a procedure "add" that takes in two parameters "num1" and "num2" and adds them together
proc add {num1 num2} {
    # Create an alias for the "puts" command to print out the result
    alias result puts
    # Add the two numbers and store the result in a variable "sum"
    set sum [expr $num1 + $num2]
    # Print out the result
    result "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum"
}
# Call the "add" procedure and pass in the variable "number" and the value 5
add $number 5

# Sample output:
# The sum of 10 and 5 is 15
