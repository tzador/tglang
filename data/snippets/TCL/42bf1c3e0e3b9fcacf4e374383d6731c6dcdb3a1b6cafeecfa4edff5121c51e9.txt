# This is a sample TCL code snippet

# Variables
set x 5                 # Declaring a variable 'x' with initial value of 5
set y 10                # Declaring a variable 'y' with initial value of 10
set z [expr $x + $y]    # Performing addition and storing result in variable 'z'

# Loop
for {set i 1} {$i <= 5} {incr i} {
    puts $i            # Print value of 'i'
}

# Conditional Statements
if {$x > $y} {
    puts "$x is greater than $y."
} elseif {$x < $y} {
    puts "$y is greater than $x."
} else {
    puts "$x is equal to $y."
}

# Function
proc multiply {a b} {
    set c [expr $a * $b]    # Performing multiplication and storing result in variable 'c'
    return $c               # Returning value of 'c'
}

# Calling Function
set result [multiply $x $y] # Calling the multiply function and storing result in variable 'result'
puts "$x x $y = $result"    # Printing the result of the multiplication

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 10 is greater than 5.
# 5 x 10 = 50
