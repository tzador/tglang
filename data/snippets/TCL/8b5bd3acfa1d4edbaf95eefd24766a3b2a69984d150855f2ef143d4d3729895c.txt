# Function to calculate the factorial of a number
proc factorial {n} {
    if {$n <= 1} { # Base case, return 1 when n is less than or equal to 1
        return 1
    } else { # Recursive case, multiply n with the factorial of n-1
        return [expr {$n * [factorial [expr $n-1]]}]

# Prompt user for input
puts "Enter a number:"
gets stdin num

# Convert input to integer and calculate factorial
set num [expr $num]
set fact [factorial $num]

# Display result
puts "Factorial of $num is $fact"

# Output:
# Enter a number:
# 5
# Factorial of 5 is 120
