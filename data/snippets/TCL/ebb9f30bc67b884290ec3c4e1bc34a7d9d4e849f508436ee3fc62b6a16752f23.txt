# This is a code snippet written in TCL
# It creates a variable, a list and uses a for loop to iterate through the list
# The code also uses conditional statements and string manipulation methods
# Output will print the list elements with a condition applied to them

set myVar "Hello World"  ;# Create a variable "myVar" with the value "Hello World"
set myList [list 1 2 3 4 5]  ;# Create a list with the values 1,2,3,4,5 and assign it to "myList"

for {set i 0} {$i < [llength $myList]} {incr i} {  ;# Using a for loop to iterate through the list
    if {[lindex $myList $i] % 2 == 0} {  ;# Check if the current element is even
        set temp [string map {"2" "two"} [lindex $myList $i]]  ;# Use string manipulation to replace "2" with "two"
        lset myList $i $temp  ;# Replace the element in the list with the modified string
    }
}

puts "List elements with even numbers replaced with strings:"
foreach element $myList {  ;# Using a foreach loop to print each element of the list
