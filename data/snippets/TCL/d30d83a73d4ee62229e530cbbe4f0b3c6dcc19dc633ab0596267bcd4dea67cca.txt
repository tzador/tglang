#Define a function for calculating the fibonacci sequence up to a given number
proc fibonacci {n} {

    #Create a list to store the fibonacci sequence
    set seq [list]

    #Initialize the first two values of the sequence to 0 and 1
    lappend seq 0 1

    #Loop through the remaining numbers and add them to the sequence
    for {set i 2} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {

        #Calculate the next value in the sequence by adding the previous two values
        set next [expr {[lindex $seq end-1] + [lindex $seq end]}]

        #Add the value to the sequence list
        lappend seq $next

    #Return the complete fibonacci sequence

#Call the fibonacci function and store the returned list in a variable
set result [fibonacci 10]

#Print the results
puts "Fibonacci Sequence: $result"
