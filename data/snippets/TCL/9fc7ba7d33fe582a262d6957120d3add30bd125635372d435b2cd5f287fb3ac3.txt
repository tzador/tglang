# This is a TCL code snippet that creates a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
# First, we define the function and give it a name "factorial"
proc factorial {n} {
  # Then we check if the given number is 0 or 1, which will return 1 as the factorial
  if {$n == 0 || $n == 1} {
    return 1
  } else {
    # If the number is greater than 1, we use a for loop to iterate through all the numbers from 2 to the given number
    for {set i 2} {$i <= $n} {incr i} {
      # Within the loop, we multiply the current number with the factorial of the previous number
      set factorial [expr {$factorial * $i}]
    }
    # Finally, we return the factorial as the output
    return $factorial
  }
}

# Now, we can call the function and pass in a number to calculate its factorial
# Let's say we want to calculate the factorial of 5
set num 5
puts "Factorial of $num is: [factorial $num]"

# This will print "Factorial of 5 is: 120" as the output
