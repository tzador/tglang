// This code snippet is a function that takes in a slice of integers and returns the average
func calculateAverage(numbers []int) float64 {
    total := 0
    // Loop through the slice and add all the numbers together
    for _, num := range numbers {
        total += num
    }
    // Calculate the average by dividing the total by the length of the slice
    average := total / len(numbers)
    return average
}

// Example usage:
numbers := []int{5, 10, 15, 20}
fmt.Println(calculateAverage(numbers)) // Output: 12.5
