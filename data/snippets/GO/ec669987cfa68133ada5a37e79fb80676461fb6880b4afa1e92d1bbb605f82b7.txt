//A function that calculates the factorial of a given number
//Input: Integer x, the number to calculate factorial for
//Output: Integer y, the factorial of x
func factorial(x int) int {
    if x == 0 {
        //Factorial of 0 is 1
        return 1
    }
    //Initialize a variable to store the factorial value
    //Start with 1 as the initial value
    var y int = 1
    //Loop through all numbers from 1 to x
    for i := 1; i <= x; i++ {
        //Multiply current number with factorial value
        y = y * i
    }
    //Return the final factorial value
    return y
}

//Example usage
//Input: x = 5
//Output: y = 120

//Executing the function and storing the output in a variable
result := factorial(5)
//Print the result to the console
fmt.Println(result)

//Output: 120
