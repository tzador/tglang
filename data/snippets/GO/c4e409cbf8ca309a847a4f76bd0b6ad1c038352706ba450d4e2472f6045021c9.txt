// This code snippet demonstrates a function in GO that calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
// Input: n (int)
// Output: f (int) - the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
func fibonacci(n int) int {
    if n < 1 { // first two terms in the sequence are 0 and 1
        return 0
    } else if n < 3 { // second term in the sequence is 1
        return 1
    } else { // for n > 2, use recursion to calculate the nth term
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    }
}

// Example usage:
// Calling fibonacci(4) will return the 4th term in the sequence, which is 2. 
// This is because the sequence starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...
// The 4th term in the sequence is 2 because it is the sum of the 2nd and 3rd term (1 + 1).
