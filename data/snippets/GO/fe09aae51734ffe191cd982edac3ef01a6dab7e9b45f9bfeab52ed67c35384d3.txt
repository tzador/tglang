// This is a complex code snippet in GO language

// Define a function that takes in two parameters, a and b, and returns their sum
func sum(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

// Define a struct named "Person" with fields for name, age, and occupation
type Person struct {
    name        string
    age         int
    occupation  string
}

//Create an instance of the Person struct with name, age, and occupation values
p := Person{
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    occupation: "Software Engineer",
}

// Define a method "speak" for the Person struct that prints out a greeting
func (p Person) speak() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, my name is", p.name, ". I am", p.age, "years old and work as a", p.occupation)
}

// Call the speak method on the Person instance
p.speak()

// Output: Hello, my name is John. I am 30 years old and work as a Software Engineer
