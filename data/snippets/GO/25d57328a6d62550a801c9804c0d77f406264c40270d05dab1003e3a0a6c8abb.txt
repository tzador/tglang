// The following code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

func factorial(n int) int {
    if n == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    return n * factorial(n-1)
}

// To execute the function and print the result, we can use the following code:

result := factorial(5)
fmt.Println(result)

// This will print out the factorial of 5, which is 120.
