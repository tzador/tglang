// Define a struct for a person
type Person struct {
   name string
   age int
   address string
}

// Create a slice of Person structs
var people []Person = []Person{
   {name: "John", age: 25, address: "123 Main St."},
   {name: "Jane", age: 28, address: "456 Broadway"},
   {name: "Bob", age: 35, address: "789 Elm Ave."},
}

// Loop through the slice and print out the names and addresses
for i := 0; i < len(people); i++ {
   fmt.Printf("%s lives at %s\n", people[i].name, people[i].address)
}

// Output:
// John lives at 123 Main St.
// Jane lives at 456 Broadway
// Bob lives at 789 Elm Ave.
