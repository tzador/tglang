// This function takes in two integers and returns the sum of their squares
func sumSquares(x int, y int) int {
    // Initialize two variables to store the squares of the input values
    var squareX int = x*x
    var squareY int = y*y

    // Add the two squares together and return the result

    // NOTE: This function could be simplified by directly squaring the inputs and returning the sum,
    // but for demonstration purposes, we have broken it down into steps.
