' This code snippet is a simple VBSCRIPT program that takes in two integers,
' calculates their sum and displays the result to the user.

' Define the variables and set their initial values.
Dim num1, num2, sum

' Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in the num1 variable.
num1 = InputBox("Enter the first number: ")

' Convert the input into an integer using the CInt function.
num1 = CInt(num1)

' Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in the num2 variable.
num2 = InputBox("Enter the second number: ")

' Convert the input into an integer using the CInt function.
num2 = CInt(num2)

' Calculate the sum by adding num1 and num2 together.
sum = num1 + num2

' Display the result to the user using the MsgBox function.
MsgBox "The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & sum

' End the program.
End
