' This code snippet generates a random password
Option Explicit ' forces variable declaration for type safety

Dim characters ' variable to hold user input of allowable characters in password
Dim length ' variable to hold user input of password length
Dim password ' variable to hold generated password
Dim i ' variable for loop iteration
Dim randomNumber ' variable to hold random number for character selection

' prompt user for input
characters = InputBox("Enter characters to be used in password:")
length = InputBox("Enter password length:")

' add characters to password randomly until desired length is reached
For i = 1 To length
    Randomize ' initialize random number generator
    randomNumber = Int((Len(characters) * Rnd) + 1) ' generate random number within length of characters
    password = password & Mid(characters, randomNumber, 1) ' add random character to password
Next

' output generated password
MsgBox "Your randomly generated password is: " & password
