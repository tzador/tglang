' This code snippet creates a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
Function factorial(num)
    ' Initialize a variable to store the result
    Dim result
    result = 1
    ' Loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number
    For i = 1 To num
        ' Multiply the current result by the current number
        result = result * i
    Next
    ' Return the final result
    factorial = result
End Function

' Example call of the factorial function and output
Dim number
number = 7
MsgBox "The factorial of " & number & " is " & factorial(number)
' Output: The factorial of 7 is 5040
