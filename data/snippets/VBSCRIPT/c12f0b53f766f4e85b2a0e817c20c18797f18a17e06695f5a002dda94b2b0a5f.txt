' Define an object to store student information
Dim student

' Define a dynamic array to store student grades
Dim grades()

' Initialize object properties
student.name = "John Smith"
student.age = 18
student.major = "Computer Science"

' Use a loop to input grades into the array
For i = 0 to 4
  grades(i) = InputBox("Enter grade for assignment " & i+1)
Next

' Calculate the average grade
Dim sum, avg
sum = 0
For i = 0 to 4
  sum = sum + grades(i)
Next
avg = sum / 5

' Print out student information and average grade
MsgBox "Student Name: " & student.name & _
vbCrLf & "Age: " & student.age & vbCrLf & _
"Major: " & student.major & vbCrLf & _
"Average Grade: " & avg

' Output:
' Student Name: John Smith
' Age: 18
' Major: Computer Science
' Average Grade: 85.6
