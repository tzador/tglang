' This code snippet shows how to create a function that calculates the factorial of a number
Function factorial(n)
    ' Check if the number is 0 or 1, if so return 1 as factorial
    If n = 0 or n = 1 Then 
        factorial = 1
        Exit Function
    End If
    ' Loop through all numbers from 2 to n and multiply them together
    For i = 2 To n 
        factorial = factorial * i 
    Next
End Function

' Main program to test the factorial function
num = 5 ' Change this value to calculate the factorial of a different number
result = factorial(num) ' Call the factorial function and store the result in a variable
MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is: " & result ' Display the result in a message box
