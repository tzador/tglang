' This code snippet generates a Fibonacci sequence with user input
Option Explicit ' forces declaration of variables before use
Dim n, first, second, count, result ' declare variables
n = InputBox("Enter number of terms to generate:") ' prompt for user input
first = 0  ' first number in the sequence
second = 1 ' second number in the sequence
result = "" ' initialize the result string
For count = 1 to n ' loop through n number of times
    result = result & first & ", " ' add the current number to the result string
    temp = first + second ' store the sum of the previous two numbers in a temporary variable
    first = second ' set the first number to the value of the second number
    second = temp ' set the second number to the value of the temporary variable
Next ' end of loop
' Print the result string to the console
MsgBox "The first " & n & " terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: " & result
