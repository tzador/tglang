' This code snippet generates a random number and prints out its square root
Dim num 
Randomize ' ensures a different random number is generated each time
num = Rnd * 100 ' generates a random number between 0 and 100
Print "The random number is: " & num ' prints out the random number
Dim square 
square = Sqr(num) ' calculates the square root of the random number
Print "The square root of the random number is: " & square ' prints out the square root value
