' This is a VBScript code snippet that calculates the factorial of a number
' The code uses a recursive function to solve the factorial
' Input variable "n" is a positive integer
Function factorial(n)
    If n = 1 Then ' base case, factorial of 1 is 1
        factorial = 1 ' return 1
    Else ' recursive case, factorial of n is n * factorial(n-1)
        factorial = n * factorial(n-1) ' recursive function call
    End If
End Function

Dim num ' declare input variable
num = 5 ' set input value, can be changed to any positive integer
MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & factorial(num) ' display result in a message box
' Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
