' This is a VBScript code snippet that performs a complex mathematical operation.
Option Explicit
Dim a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l ' Declaring variables
Const PI = 3.14159265359 ' Defining constants
a = 2 ' Assigning values to variables
b = 5
c = 8
d = a + b ' Performing basic addition operation
e = c * d ' Performing basic multiplication operation
f = e Mod 3 ' Performing modulo operation
g = Round(e / f, 2) ' Performing division operation and rounding the result to 2 decimal places
h = Abs(-5) ' Performing absolute value operation
i = Sqr(25) ' Performing square root operation
j = Sin(PI / 2) ' Performing sine operation
k = Sgn(-10) ' Performing sign operation
l = Cos(PI) ' Performing cosine operation
MsgBox "The final result is: " & g + h - i * j * k * l ' Outputting final result with message box
