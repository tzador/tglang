''' This code snippet assigns a random number between 1 and 10 to a variable and checks whether it's greater than 5.
''' If it is, it prints a message acknowledging it, otherwise it prints a different message.
''' This code uses the Rnd function to generate the random number and the If/Else statement for the conditional logic.
 
' Generate random number using Rnd function
random_number = Int((10 * Rnd) + 1)

' Check if random number is greater than 5
If random_number > 5 Then 
    ' If yes, print acknowledging message
    MsgBox "The random number " & random_number & " is greater than 5"
Else 
    ' If no, print different message
    MsgBox "The random number " & random_number & " is not greater than 5"
End If

''' Expected output:
