' Here is a long and complex code snippet in VBSCRIPT
' It calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function
' The output is sent to the console

Sub Main()
    Dim num
    num = InputBox("Enter a number:")
    ' InputBox function prompts the user for a value and assigns it to the variable 'num'
    MsgBox "Factorial of " & num & " is " & CalculateFactorial(num)
    ' MsgBox function displays a message box with the result of the factorial calculation
End Sub

Function CalculateFactorial(n)
    If (n = 0 Or n = 1) Then
        CalculateFactorial = 1
    Else
        CalculateFactorial = n * CalculateFactorial(n-1)
    End If
    ' This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number
    ' It checks for the base case of n being 0 or 1, then performs the calculation
    ' for larger numbers by calling itself with n-1 as the parameter
End Function

Main()
' This line calls the Main subroutine to start the program
' Output: Factorial of [input number] is [calculated factorial]
' Example: Factorial of 5 is 120 (since 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)
