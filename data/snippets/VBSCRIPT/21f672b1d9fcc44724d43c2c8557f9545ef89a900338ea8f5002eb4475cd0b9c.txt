' This code snippet creates a list of numbers from 1 to 100,
' checks each number if it is a prime number,
' and prints the prime numbers in the list on separate lines

        ' check if i is divisible by j, if yes increment factor count
        If i Mod j = 0 Then
            factorCount = factorCount + 1
        End If
    Next

    ' if the current number has exactly 2 factors (1 and itself), it is a prime number
    If factorCount = 2 Then
