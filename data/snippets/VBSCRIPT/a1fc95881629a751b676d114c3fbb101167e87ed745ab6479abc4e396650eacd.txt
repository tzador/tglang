' This program calculates the area of a circle using the radius as input
Option Explicit ' forces variable declaration

Dim radius, area ' define variables
Const PI = 3.141592653589793 ' define constant for pi

' Prompt the user to enter the radius
radius = InputBox("Please enter the radius of the circle:") ' get input from user

' Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: A = PI * r^2
area = PI * (radius ^ 2) ' perform calculation

' Output the result to the user
MsgBox "The area of the circle with radius " & radius & " is " & area & " square units." ' display result to user
