' This code snippet demonstrates a simple calculator program in VBSCRIPT
' It takes two numbers as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations

Option Explicit

' Prompt the user to enter the first number
Input1 = InputBox("Enter the first number:")

' Prompt the user to enter the second number
Input2 = InputBox("Enter the second number:")

' Convert the input strings to numbers
Num1 = CDbl(Input1)
Num2 = CDbl(Input2)

' Calculate the sum of the two numbers
Sum = Num1 + Num2

' Display the sum to the user
MsgBox "The sum of " & Num1 & " and " & Num2 & " is " & Sum

' Calculate the difference of the two numbers
Diff = Num1 - Num2

' Display the difference to the user
MsgBox "The difference of " & Num1 & " and " & Num2 & " is " & Diff

' Calculate the product of the two numbers
Prod = Num1 * Num2

' Display the product to the user
MsgBox "The product of " & Num1 & " and " & Num2 & " is " & Prod

' Calculate the quotient of the two numbers
Quot = Num1 / Num2

' Display the quotient to the user
MsgBox "The quotient of " & Num1 & " and " & Num2 & " is " & Quot

' Check if the second number is 0 to prevent division by 0 error
If Num2 = 0 Then
    ' Display error message if second number is 0
    MsgBox "Error: Cannot divide by 0."
Else
    ' Calculate the remainder of the two numbers
    Rem = Num1 Mod Num2

    ' Display the remainder to the user
    MsgBox "The remainder of " & Num1 & " and " & Num2 & " is " & Rem
End If

' Calculate the result of raising the first number to the power of the second number
Power = Num1 ^ Num2

' Display the result to the user
MsgBox "The result of " & Num1 & " raised to the power of " & Num2 & " is " & Power
