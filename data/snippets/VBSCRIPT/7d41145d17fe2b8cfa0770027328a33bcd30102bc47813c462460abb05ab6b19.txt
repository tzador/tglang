' This code snippet creates an array containing numbers from 1 to 100
' and then prints out only the even numbers in the array.

' Initialize the array
Dim numbers(99)

' Populate the array with numbers from 1 to 100
For i = 0 to 99
  numbers(i) = i + 1
Next

' Loop through the array
For Each num in numbers
  ' Check if number is even
  If num mod 2 = 0 Then
    ' Print the even number
    Debug.Print(num)
  End If
