' This code snippet demonstrates the use of a VBScript class 

Class Employee ' Class declaration
    Private firstName ' Private variable for first name
    Private lastName ' Private variable for last name
    Private id ' Private variable for employee id

    ' Property procedure for getting and setting the first name
    Public Property Get FirstName
        FirstName = firstName
    End Property
    Public Property Let FirstName(value)
        firstName = value
    End Property

    ' Property procedure for getting and setting the last name
    Public Property Get LastName
        LastName = lastName
    End Property
    Public Property Let LastName(value)
        lastName = value
    End Property

    ' Property procedure for getting and setting the employee id
    Public Property Get ID
        ID = id
    End Property
    Public Property Let ID(value)
        id = value
    End Property

    ' Method for printing employee information
    Public Sub PrintEmployeeInfo
        MsgBox "Employee Name: " & firstName & " " & lastName & vbNewLine & "Employee ID: " & id
    End Sub
End Class ' End of class declaration

' Create an instance of the Employee class
Set employee1 = New Employee 

' Set the first name, last name, and id for the employee
employee1.FirstName = "John"
employee1.LastName = "Smith"
employee1.ID = 123456
