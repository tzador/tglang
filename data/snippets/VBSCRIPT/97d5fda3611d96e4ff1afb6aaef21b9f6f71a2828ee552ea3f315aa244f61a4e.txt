<!-- code snippet in VBSCRIPT -->

' This is a demo code to generate Fibonacci series using VBSCRIPT

' Initialize the first two terms
Dim firstTerm, secondTerm, nextTerm, i, n
firstTerm = 0
secondTerm = 1
' Input number of terms
n = 10
' Display first two terms
msgbox "Fibonacci Series: "
msgbox firstTerm
msgbox secondTerm
' Calculate next terms and display them
For i = 1 to n-2
    nextTerm = firstTerm + secondTerm
    msgbox nextTerm
    ' Update first and second terms for next iteration
    firstTerm = secondTerm
    secondTerm = nextTerm
Next
