' This is a VBScript program to calculate the factorial of a number

' First, we define a function to calculate factorial
Function factorial(num)
    
    ' Variable to store the result
    Dim result 
    
    ' Initialize the result to 1
    result = 1
    
    ' Loop through the numbers from 1 to num
    For i = 1 To num 
        
        ' Multiply the result by the current number
        result = result * i 
        
    Next 
    
    ' Return the final result
    factorial = result
    
End Function

' Ask user for the input number
inputNum = InputBox("Enter a number to calculate factorial")

' Convert the input to integer
inputNum = CInt(inputNum)

' Variable to store the calculated factorial
Dim answer 

' Call the factorial function and pass in the input number
answer = factorial(inputNum)

' Display the result to the user
MsgBox "The factorial of " & inputNum & " is " & answer
