' This code snippet shows a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

Function factorial(num)
    If num = 0 Then ' If number is 0, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
        factorial = 1 ' Set the return value of the function as 1
    Else ' If number is not 0
        factorial = num * factorial(num - 1) ' Recursively call the function to find the factorial of the previous number and multiply it with the current number
    End If
End Function

num = 5 ' Set the value for which factorial is to be calculated

result = factorial(num) ' Call the factorial function and store the return value in a variable

MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & result ' Display a message box with the calculated factorial

' Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
