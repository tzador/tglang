' This code snippet calculates the average of two numbers
' using two variables and displays the result in a message box
' assuming that the user inputs numbers as arguments.

Dim num1, num2, avg
' variables for storing the two numbers and the average

num1 = InputBox("Enter first number:")
num2 = InputBox("Enter second number:")
' takes input from user and stores them in the variables

avg = (num1 + num2) / 2
' calculates the average by adding the two numbers and dividing by 2

MsgBox "The average of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & avg
' displays the result in a message box using concatenation

'The result will be in this format:
'The average of <num1> and <num2> is <avg>
'Where <num1> and <num2> are the input numbers and <avg> is the calculated average

'Example:
'If user inputs 5 as num1 and 10 as num2, the result will be:
'The average of 5 and 10 is 7.5

'Disclaimer: This code is for educational purposes only.
'Always validate user inputs and handle errors appropriately.

'Note: The average may not be accurate if the user inputs non-numeric values.
'To avoid this, use error handling and validations in the code.
