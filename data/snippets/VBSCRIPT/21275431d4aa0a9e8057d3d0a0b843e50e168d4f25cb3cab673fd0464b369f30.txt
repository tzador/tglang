'This is a VBSCRIPT code snippet that creates a class and defines its properties and methods
'Start by using the `Class...End Class` keywords to create a new class
'The name of the class is "Person"
Class Person

  'Inside the class, define some public properties using the `Public` keyword
  'Here, we define a property called "name" with a default value of an empty string
  Public name = ""

  'We can also define properties with specific data types and default values
  'In this case, we define an integer property called "age" with a default value of 0
  Public age as Integer = 0

  'Now, let's define a private property using the `Private` keyword
  'This property will not be accessible from outside the class
  Private location = "Unknown"

  'Next, we can define methods (functions) for our class
  'Let's create a method called "greeting" that will print out a greeting message
  Public Function greeting()
    'Inside the method, we can access the properties of the class using the `Me` keyword
    'Here, we concatenate the name property with the greeting message and print it out
    MsgBox "Hello " & Me.name & "!" & vbNewLine & "Welcome to " & Me.location
  End Function
  
  'We can also have methods with parameters
  'Let's create a method called "changeLocation" that takes a location as a parameter
  Public Function changeLocation(newLocation)
    'Inside the method, we can access the private property and change its value
    'Here, we set the location property to the value of the newLocation parameter
    Me.location = newLocation
  End Function

End Class

'Now, let's create an instance of our class by using the `Set` keyword and the class name
'Set a variable called "person1" to represent the new Person object
Set person1 = New Person

'Next, we can use the properties and methods of our class through the variable
'Let's set a value for the name property
person1.name = "John Smith"

'And set a value for the age property
person1.age = 25

'Now, let's call the greeting method to see the result
person1.greeting() 'This will display a message saying "Hello John Smith! Welcome to Unknown"

'Next, let's call the changeLocation method to update the location property
person1.changeLocation("New York") 'This will change the location property to "New York"

'And call the greeting method again to see the updated result
person1.greeting() 'This will display a message saying "Hello John Smith! Welcome to New York"
