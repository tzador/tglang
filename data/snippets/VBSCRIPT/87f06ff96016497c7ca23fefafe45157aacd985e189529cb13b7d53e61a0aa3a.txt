'This code snippet shows how to find the longest word in a string
'and display it in a message box.

'Initialize the string variable
Dim strInput
strInput = "This is a long sentence with many long words"

'Convert the string into an array of words
Dim arrWords
arrWords = Split(strInput, " ")

'Initialize the variable to track the longest word
Dim longestWord
longestWord = arrWords(0)

'Loop through the array of words
For i = 1 To UBound(arrWords)
    'Check if the current word is longer than the longest word
    If Len(arrWords(i)) > Len(longestWord) Then
        'If so, set it as the new longest word
        longestWord = arrWords(i)
    End If
Next

'Display the longest word in a message box
MsgBox "The longest word in the string is: " & longestWord
