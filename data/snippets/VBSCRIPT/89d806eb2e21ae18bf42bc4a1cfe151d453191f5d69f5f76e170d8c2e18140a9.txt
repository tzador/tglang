' This is a complex code snippet that generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

Dim n, first, second, i
n = 10 ' Change this value to generate a different sequence
first = 0 ' First number in the sequence
second = 1 ' Second number in the sequence
i = 0 ' Counter variable

' Print the first two numbers in the sequence
WScript.Echo "Fibonacci Sequence:"
WScript.Echo first
WScript.Echo second

' Loop to generate next numbers in the sequence
While i < n
    ' Calculate next number by adding previous two numbers
    Dim next_num
    next_num = first + second

    ' Print the next number in the sequence
    WScript.Echo next_num

    ' Update variables to continue the sequence
    first = second
    second = next_num
    i = i + 1

' Output:
'
' Fibonacci Sequence:
' 0
' 1
' 1
' 2
' 3
