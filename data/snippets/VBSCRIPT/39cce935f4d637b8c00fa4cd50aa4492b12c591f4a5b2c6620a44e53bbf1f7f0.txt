' This is a VBScript code snippet that creates a function to calculate the area of a rectangle
' This function takes the length and width of the rectangle as parameters
Function CalculateArea(length, width)
    ' Set the initial value of area to 0
    Dim area
    area = 0
    ' Check if the length and width are greater than 0
    If length > 0 And width > 0 Then
        ' Calculate the area by multiplying length and width
        area = length * width
    End If
    ' Return the calculated area
    CalculateArea = area
End Function

' Call the function with length = 5 and width = 3
area = CalculateArea(5, 3)
' Print the result using MsgBox function
MsgBox "The area of the rectangle is: " & area
