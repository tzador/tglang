' Create a sub procedure called "calculate_average" that takes in an array of numbers
Sub calculate_average(numbers)
 
    ' Declare a variable to store the sum of the numbers
    Dim sum
    sum = 0

    ' Loop through each number in the array
    For i = LBound(numbers) To UBound(numbers)
        
        ' Add the current number to the sum
        sum = sum + numbers(i)
    Next

    ' Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of numbers in the array
    average = sum / (UBound(numbers) - LBound(numbers) + 1)

    ' Print out the result
    Msgbox "The average is " & average
End Sub

' Call the "calculate_average" sub procedure with an array of numbers
numbers = Array(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)
calculate_average(numbers)

' Output:
' The average is 15
