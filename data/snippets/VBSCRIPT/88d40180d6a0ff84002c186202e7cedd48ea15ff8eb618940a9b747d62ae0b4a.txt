' This is a code snippet in VBScript
' It creates a FizzBuzz program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number
' and for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz" instead of the number. For multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".

' Loop through numbers 1 to 100
For i = 1 To 100
    ' Check if number is divisible by both 3 and 5
    If i Mod 3 = 0 And i Mod 5 = 0 Then
        ' Print "FizzBuzz" if true
        MsgBox("FizzBuzz")
    ' Check if number is divisible by 3
    ElseIf i Mod 3 = 0 Then
