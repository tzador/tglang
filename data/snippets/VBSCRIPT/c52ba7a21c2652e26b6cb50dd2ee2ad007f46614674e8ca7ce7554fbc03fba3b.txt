' This is a VBScript code snippet that creates an array of students with their grades and calculates the average grade

' This section declares the variables and initializes them with values
Dim studentNames(4) ' declares an array with 4 elements
studentNames(0) = "John" ' assigns student name
studentNames(1) = "Jane"
studentNames(2) = "Bob"
studentNames(3) = "Sally"

Dim grades(4) ' declares an array with 4 elements
grades(0) = 95 ' assigns grade
grades(1) = 88
grades(2) = 73
grades(3) = 82

Dim sum ' declares a variable for sum of grades
sum = 0 ' initializes sum to 0

' This section uses a For loop to iterate through the grades array and find the sum
For i = 0 To UBound(grades) ' UBound() function is used to find the upper bound of an array
    sum = sum + grades(i) ' adds each grade to the sum variable
Next

Dim average ' declares a variable for average grade
average = sum / UBound(grades) ' calculates the average by dividing sum by the number of grades

' This section prints the student names and grades in a formatted table
For i = 0 To UBound(studentNames)
    Print studentNames(i) & " has a grade of " & grades(i)
Next

Print "The average grade is: " & average ' prints the average grade

' Output:
'
