' This code snippet is a function written in VBSCRIPT that checks if a given number is prime or not.
' It takes in a single parameter, `num`, and returns a boolean value.

Function isPrime(num)
    ' Check if the number is lesser than 2, which is not a prime number.
    If num < 2 Then
        isPrime = False
    Else
        ' Set a flag variable to keep track if the number is divisible by any other number.
        flag = False
        ' Loop from 2 to half of the number and check if it is divisible. 
        For i = 2 To num / 2
            ' If the number is divisible, set the flag to true and exit the loop.
            If num Mod i = 0 Then
                flag = True
                Exit For
            End If
        Next
        ' If the flag is true, it means the number is divisible by some other number, hence not a prime number.
        ' Otherwise, it is a prime number.
        If flag = True Then
            isPrime = False
        Else
            isPrime = True
        End If
    End If
End Function

' Call the function and pass in a number to check if it is a prime number.
isPrimeNumber = isPrime(17)
' Print out the result.
MsgBox "Is 17 a prime number? " & isPrimeNumber
