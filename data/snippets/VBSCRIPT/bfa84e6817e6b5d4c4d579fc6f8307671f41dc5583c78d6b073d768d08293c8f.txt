' A sample code snippet in VBSCRIPT
'
' This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the factorial of a given number using a recursive function.
'
' Variables:
'   - num: the number whose factorial is to be calculated
'   - factorial: stores the value of the factorial
''`'
Option Explicit

' Prompt user to enter a number
num = InputBox("Enter a number: ")

' Call the factorial function and store the result in the factorial variable
factorial = factorial(num)

' Display the result
MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & factorial

' Recursive function to calculate the factorial
Function factorial(num)
    If num = 0 Or num = 1 Then
        ' Base case: when the number is 0 or 1, return 1
        factorial = 1
    Else
        ' Recursive case: multiply the number with the factorial of one less than the number
        factorial = num * factorial(num - 1)
    End If
End Function
