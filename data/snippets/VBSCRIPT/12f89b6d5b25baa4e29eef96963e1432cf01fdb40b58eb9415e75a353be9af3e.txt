'This code snippet is an annotated example of a function that calculates the sum of two numbers in VBSCRIPT.
'The function starts with the keyword "Function" followed by its name and the parameters it takes in.
Function Sum (num1, num2)
'Next, we declare a variable to store the sum and set it to 0.
Dim result
result = 0
'Using a conditional statement, we check if both numbers are valid (not empty) and numeric.
'If they are, we add them together and store the result in the "result" variable.
If IsNumeric(num1) AND IsNumeric(num2) Then
    result = num1 + num2
End If
'Finally, we use the "MsgBox" method to display the result to the user.
MsgBox "The sum is: " & result
'Lastly, we use the keyword "End Function" to mark the end of the function.
End Function
'Now, we can call this function and pass in any two numbers as parameters to calculate their sum.
Sum 5, 10
'The output of this code snippet would be a message box displaying the sum of 5 and 10, which is 15.
'This concludes our annotated VBSCRIPT code snippet for calculating the sum of two numbers.
