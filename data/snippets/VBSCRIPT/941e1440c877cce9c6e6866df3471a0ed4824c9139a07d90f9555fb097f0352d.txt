' This code snippet declares a function that takes in two parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers.

Function sumNumbers(num1, num2)
    sum = num1 + num2 ' adds the two numbers and assigns the value to the variable 'sum'
    sumNumbers = sum ' returns the value of 'sum'
End Function

' This code snippet calls the function and assigns the return value to a variable.

result = sumNumbers(5, 10) ' calls the 'sumNumbers' function and passes in the numbers 5 and 10 as arguments
'  the value returned by the function is assigned to the variable 'result'
' the value of 'result' would be 15 since 5 + 10 = 15

' This code snippet prints the result of the function call.

WScript.Echo "The sum of 5 and 10 is: " & result ' prints the text "The sum of 5 and 10 is: 15"
' the '&' operator concatenates the text and the value of 'result' into one string to be printed
