' This code snippet demonstrates a function in VBSCRIPT that calculates
' the factorial of a given number.

Function Factorial(number)
    ' This function uses recursion to calculate the factorial
    ' of a given number.
    ' It takes in a number as input and returns the factorial as output.

    ' Base case: return 1 if number is 0 or 1
    If number = 0 Or number = 1 Then
        Factorial = 1
    Else
        ' Recursive case: call the function again with number-1
        ' and multiply it with the current number.
        Factorial = Factorial(number - 1) * number
    End If
End Function

' Example usage:
Wscript.Echo "The factorial of 5 is " & Factorial(5)

' Output:
' The factorial of 5 is 120
