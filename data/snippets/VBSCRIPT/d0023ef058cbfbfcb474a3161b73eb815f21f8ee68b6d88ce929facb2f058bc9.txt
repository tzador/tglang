' This code snippet is an example of creating and using a function in VBScript

' First, we declare a function called "add_numbers" that takes in two parameters, x and y
Function add_numbers(x, y)
    
    ' Next, we declare a variable "sum" and set it equal to the sum of x and y
    Dim sum : sum = x + y
    
    ' We then use the "MsgBox" function to display the sum to the user in a message box
    MsgBox "The sum of " & x & " and " & y & " is " & sum
    
    ' Finally, we use the "return" statement to return the value of the sum
    add_numbers = sum
    
End Function

' Now, we can call the "add_numbers" function and pass in two numbers as arguments
add_numbers 2, 3

' The output in the message box would be: "The sum of 2 and 3 is 5"
