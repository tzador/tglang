Option Explicit ' Forces variables to be declared before use

Dim name ' Declares a variable without defining it
name = InputBox("Enter your name:") ' Prompts user to enter a name

If name = "" Then ' Checks if user entered a name or not
    MsgBox "You did not enter a name." ' Displays a message if no name was entered
Else ' If a name was entered
    MsgBox "Hello, " + name ' Displays a personalized greeting
