' This code snippet uses a for loop to generate a list of prime numbers between 2 and 100
' Define variables
Dim i, j, num, primeFlag
' Set the initial value of primeFlag to 1
primeFlag = 1
' Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 2 to 100
For i = 2 to 100
    ' Assume the number is prime unless proven otherwise
    primeFlag = 1
    ' Check if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and i/2
    For j = 2 to (i/2)
        ' If the number is divisible by any number, set primeFlag to 0 and exit the for loop
        If (i Mod j) = 0 Then
            primeFlag = 0
            Exit For
        End If
    Next
    ' If primeFlag is still 1 after the for loop, the number is prime and print it
    If primeFlag = 1 Then
        ' Format the number as a string
        num = CStr(i)
        ' Print the prime number in the console
        MsgBox "Prime number: " & num
    End If
Next
' Output:
' Prime number: 2
' Prime number: 3
' Prime number: 5
' ...
' Prime number: 97
