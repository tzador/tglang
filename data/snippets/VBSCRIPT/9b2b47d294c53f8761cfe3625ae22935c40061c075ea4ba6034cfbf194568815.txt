' This is a VBScript code snippet that performs a complex calculation on an array of numbers.
' The output is a single value representing the result of the calculation.

' Declare an array of numbers
Dim numbers(3)
numbers(0) = 10
numbers(1) = 5
numbers(2) = 2
numbers(3) = 8

' Initialize a variable to hold the result
Dim result

' Loop through the array and perform the calculation
For i = 0 To UBound(numbers)
    ' Check if the current element is even
    If numbers(i) Mod 2 = 0 Then
        ' Add the current element to the result if it is even
        result = result + numbers(i)
    Else
        ' Multiply the current element by 2 and add it to the result if it is odd
        result = result + (numbers(i) * 2)
    End If
Next

' Display the result
MsgBox "The calculated result is: " & result
