' This code snippet is used to calculate the sum of all integers in a given range
' Set the starting number
startNum = 1
' Set the ending number
endNum = 10
' Initialize the total sum to 0
sum = 0

' Loop through the range of numbers from startNum to endNum
For i = startNum To endNum
    ' Add the current number to the total sum
    sum = sum + i

    ' Optional: Print the current number and the updated sum
    ' WScript.Echo "Current number: " & i
    ' WScript.Echo "Updated sum: " & sum
Next

' Print the final sum and the range of numbers used
WScript.Echo "The sum of all numbers from " & startNum & " to " & endNum & " is: " & sum
