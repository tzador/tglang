'This program adds two numbers.

'Create variables to store the two numbers

'Create a variable to store the sum of the two numbers
Dim sum

'Add the two numbers and store the result in the sum variable
sum = num1 + num2

'Print the result
MsgBox "The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & sum

'Create a function to calculate the factorial of a number
