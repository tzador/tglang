' Variable to store the sum of numbers
sum = 0
' For loop to iterate through the array
For i = 0 to UBound(numbers)
    ' Add each element to the sum
    sum = sum + numbers(i)
Next

' Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
average = sum / UBound(numbers)
' Print the average
MsgBox "The average of the numbers is: " & average
