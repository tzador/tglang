' This program calculates the area of a circle
Dim radius ' declare a variable for the radius of the circle
radius = 5.2 ' assign a value to the radius
Const PI = 3.14 ' create a constant for the value of PI
Dim area ' declare a variable to store the calculated area
area = PI * (radius ^ 2) ' calculate the area using the formula
' print the result to the console
MsgBox "The area of the circle with radius " & radius & " is: " & area
' This program also checks if the calculated area is greater than 50
If area > 50 Then
  MsgBox "The area is greater than 50."
Else
  MsgBox "The area is not greater than 50."
