' This code snippet creates a function that calculates the average of a given list of numbers.

Function Average(numbers)

    ' Initialize a variable to store the sum of the numbers and another variable to store the length of the list.
    Dim sum, length

    ' Use the built-in function IsArray to check if the given argument is an array.
    If IsArray(numbers) Then

        ' Use the built-in function UBound to get the upper bound of the array.
        length = UBound(numbers)

        ' Use a loop to iterate through each element in the array and calculate the sum.
        For i = 0 To length

            ' Use the operator "+" to add the current element to the sum variable.
            sum = sum + numbers(i)

        Next

        ' Use the built-in function Avg to calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list.
        Average = Avg(sum / length)

    Else

        ' If the given argument is not an array, return an error.
        Average = "Error: Input is not a valid array."
