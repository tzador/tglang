' This VBScript code snippet creates a function to calculate the average of an array of numbers

' Define a function named CalculateAverage with parameters numbers
Function CalculateAverage(numbers)

    ' Declare and initialize variables sum and count to 0
    Dim sum: sum = 0
    Dim count: count = 0

    ' Loop through each number in the array
    For Each num In numbers

        ' Add the current number to the sum variable
        sum = sum + num

        ' Increment count variable by 1
        count = count + 1
    Next

    ' Calculate the average by dividing sum by count
    Dim average
    average = sum / count

    ' Return the calculated average
    CalculateAverage = average

' End function
End Function

' Create an array of numbers to pass into the function
Dim arr
arr = Array(4, 6, 9, 2, 8)

' Call the CalculateAverage function and pass in the array as an argument
Dim result
result = CalculateAverage(arr)

' Display the result
MsgBox "The average of the numbers is " & result
