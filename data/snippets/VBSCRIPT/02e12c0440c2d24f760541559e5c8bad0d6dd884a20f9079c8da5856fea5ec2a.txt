Sub Fibonacci(n)
' This function calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
' Input: number n - the index of the desired Fibonacci number.
' Output: number - the nth Fibonacci number.

Dim n1, n2, i, temp

n1 = 0    ' First number in the sequence
n2 = 1    ' Second number in the sequence
i = 1    ' Counter variable to keep track of iterations

' Loop through the sequence until the desired number is reached.
Do While i < n

    ' Calculate the next number by adding the previous two numbers.
    temp = n1 + n2
    n1 = n2
    n2 = temp

    ' Increment counter variable.
    i = i + 1
Loop

' Output the desired Fibonacci number.
MsgBox "The " & n & "th Fibonacci number is " & n1

' Call the function to calculate the 10th Fibonacci number.
Fibonacci(10)

' Output:
' The 10th Fibonacci number is 34
