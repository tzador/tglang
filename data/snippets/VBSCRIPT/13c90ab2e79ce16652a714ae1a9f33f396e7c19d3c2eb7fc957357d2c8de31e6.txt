' This code snippet creates a nested for loop and prints out a multiplication table from 1 to 10
For i = 1 to 10 ' loop from 1 to 10
	For j = 1 to 10 ' loop from 1 to 10
		mult = i * j ' calculate the multiplication
		If mult < 10 Then ' if the result is a single digit number, add an extra space for formatting
			WScript.Echo " " & mult;
		Else ' otherwise, just print the result
			WScript.Echo mult;
		End If
	Next
	WScript.Echo "" ' add an empty line for better formatting
