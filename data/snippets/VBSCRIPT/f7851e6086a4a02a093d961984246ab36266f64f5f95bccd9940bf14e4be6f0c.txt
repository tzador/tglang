The following code snippet is written in VBScript and it demonstrates the use of a For loop and conditional statements.

' Declare a variable to hold the total number of students
Dim numStudents

' Prompt the user to enter the total number of students in the class
numStudents = InputBox("Enter the total number of students in the class: ")

' Convert the user input to an integer
numStudents = CInt(numStudents)

' Initialize a variable to hold the sum of grades
Dim sumGrades
sumGrades = 0

' Use a For loop to iterate through each student
For i = 1 To numStudents

    ' Prompt the user to enter the grade for the current student
    Dim grade
    grade = InputBox("Enter the grade for student " & i & ": ")

    ' Convert the user input to an integer
    grade = CInt(grade)

    ' Check if the grade is greater than or equal to 90
    If grade >= 90 Then
        ' Add 3 points to the sum of grades
        sumGrades = sumGrades + grade + 3

    ' Check if the grade is between 80 and 89
    ElseIf grade >= 80 And grade <= 89 Then
        ' Add 2 points to the sum of grades
        sumGrades = sumGrades + grade + 2

    ' Check if the grade is between 70 and 79
    ElseIf grade >= 70 And grade <= 79 Then
        ' Add 1 point to the sum of grades
        sumGrades = sumGrades + grade + 1
    End If
Next

' Calculate the average grade
Dim avgGrade
avgGrade = sumGrades / numStudents

' Print out the average grade
MsgBox "The average grade for the class is: " & avgGrade
