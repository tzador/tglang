' This code snippet calculates the average of a given array of numbers

Dim numbers(5)
numbers = Array(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

Dim sum : sum = 0 ' initialize the variable for sum

' loop through the numbers array and add each number to the sum variable
For i = 0 to UBound(numbers)
    sum = sum + numbers(i)
Next

Dim average : average = sum / (UBound(numbers) + 1) ' calculate average

' print the result
MsgBox "The average of the numbers is " & average
