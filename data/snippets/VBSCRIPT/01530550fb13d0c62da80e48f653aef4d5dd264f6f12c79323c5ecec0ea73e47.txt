<!--This is a VBScript code snippet that implements a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
The function takes in one parameter, num, and returns the calculated factorial value-->
Function factorial(num) 
If num = 0 Then 'Check if num is equal to 0
factorial = 1 'If true, return 1 as factorial value
Else 'If num is not equal to 0
factorial = 1 'Initialize factorial value to 1
For i = 1 to num 'Loop through numbers 1 to num
factorial = factorial * i 'Multiply factorial value by current number
Next 'Go to next number
End If
End Function
'Example call of the factorial function with input value of 5
result = factorial(5) 'This will assign the value of 120 to the variable result
'This code snippet uses the 4 indentation rule, curly braces are not required in VBScript.
