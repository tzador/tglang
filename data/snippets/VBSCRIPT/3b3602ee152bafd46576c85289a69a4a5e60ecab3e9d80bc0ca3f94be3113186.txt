' This code snippet demonstrates a function in VBScript that calculates the factorial of a given number
Function Factorial(n)
   ' Initialize the result variable to 1
   result = 1
   ' Loop through all the numbers from 1 to n
   For i = 1 to n
      ' Multiply the current result by the current number
      result = result * i
   Next
   ' Return the result
   Factorial = result
End Function

' Call the function and store the result in a variable
myNum = Factorial(5)

' Print the result
MsgBox "The factorial of 5 is " & myNum
