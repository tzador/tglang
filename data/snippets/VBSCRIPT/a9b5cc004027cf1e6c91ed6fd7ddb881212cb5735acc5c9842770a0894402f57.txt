' Define a variable
dim num

' Set the variable equal to a number
num = 5

' Create a function to check if the number is odd or even
Function checkNumber(num)
    ' Use the Mod operator to check if the number is divisible by 2
    If num Mod 2 = 0 Then
        ' If the number is divisible by 2, it is even
        checkNumber = "Even"
    Else
        ' If the number is not divisible by 2, it is odd
        checkNumber = "Odd"
    End If
End Function

' Call the function and store the result
result = checkNumber(num)

' Print the result
MsgBox "The number is " & result
