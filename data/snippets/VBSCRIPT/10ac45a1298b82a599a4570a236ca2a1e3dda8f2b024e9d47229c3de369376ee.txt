' This code snippet illustrates how to create a random list of numbers in VBSCRIPT
Set objRandom = CreateObject("System.Random") ' Creates a new instance of the Random object
Dim numbers(9) ' Creates an array with 10 indices
For i = 0 To 9 ' Loop through the indices
    numbers(i) = objRandom.Next(1, 100) ' Generates a random number between 1 and 99 and adds it to the array
Next ' Move to the next index
WScript.Echo "The random numbers generated are: " ' Prints the start of the output message
For Each num In numbers ' Loop through each number in the array
    WScript.Echo num ' Print out each number in a new line
Next ' Move to the next number
