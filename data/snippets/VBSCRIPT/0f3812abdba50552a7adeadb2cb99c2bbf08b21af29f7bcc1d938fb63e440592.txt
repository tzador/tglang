' Commentary:
' This code snippet is written in VBSCRIPT and it checks if a given password meets certain criteria. 
' The variable "password" is declared to store the input from the user. 
' An instance of the RegExp class is created to use regular expressions for checking the password criteria. 
' The regular expression used in this code snippet requires the password to contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character (!#$%&*), with a minimum length of 8 characters. 
' The "Test" method is used to check if the input password matches the regular expression. 
' If it does, a message is displayed using the "MsgBox" function. 
' If it does not match, a different message is displayed.
