' The rest of the code is optional and can be added as per the requirements
' Some possible additions could be:
' - A while loop to print numbers in reverse order
' - An array to store and retrieve multiple values
' - A function to calculate the area of a circle
' - Objects and methods for interacting with the HTML DOM in web development
