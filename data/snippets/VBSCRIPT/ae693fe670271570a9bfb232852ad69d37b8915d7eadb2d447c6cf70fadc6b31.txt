' This code snippet generates a random password by selecting characters from a pool of special characters, numbers, lowercase letters, and uppercase letters. The length of the password can be specified by the user.

' Define the pool of characters
Const pool = "!@#$%^&*()123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" 

' Get password length from user
passLength = InputBox("Please enter the desired password length:")

' Initialize an empty string for the password
password = ""

' Loop through random characters from the pool until the password reaches the desired length
For i = 1 To passLength
    ' Generate a random index
    randomIndex = Int((Len(pool) * Rnd()) + 1)

    ' Append the character at that index to the password string
    password = password & Mid(pool, randomIndex, 1)
Next

' Output the generated password
MsgBox "Your generated password is: " & password
