' This is a comment in VBSCRIPT that explains the purpose of the following code snippet

' Creating a function named "calculate_average" that takes in two parameters "num1" and "num2"
Function calculate_average(num1, num2)

  ' Declaring a variable named "average" and setting it equal to the sum of the two parameters divided by 2
  average = (num1 + num2)/2

  ' Using "MsgBox" function to display a message to the user with the calculated average
  MsgBox "The average of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & average
  
End Function

' Calling the "calculate_average" function and passing in two integer values as arguments
calculate_average(5, 10)

' Creating a loop that will iterate 10 times
For i = 1 to 10 

  ' Checking if the current iteration is an even number
  If (i Mod 2) = 0 Then

    ' Using "MsgBox" function to display a message to the user with the current even number
    MsgBox "Current even number is " & i
