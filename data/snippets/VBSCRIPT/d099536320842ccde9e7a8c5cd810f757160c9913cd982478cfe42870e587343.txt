' This code snippet uses VBSCRIPT to calculate the sum of two numbers
' and prints the result to the console

Option Explicit ' ensures variables are declared before use

Dim num1, num2, sum ' declares the variables to hold user input and the resulting sum

num1 = 10 ' assigns a value of 10 to num1
num2 = 15 ' assigns a value of 15 to num2
sum = num1 + num2 ' calculates the sum of num1 and num2 and stores it in the sum variable

' prints the result to the console using the Debug.Print statement
Debug.Print "The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & sum
