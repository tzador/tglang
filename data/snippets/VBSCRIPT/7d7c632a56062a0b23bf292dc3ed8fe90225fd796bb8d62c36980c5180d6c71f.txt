Dim width, length, area ' declaring variables to store the values

width = InputBox("Enter the width in meters:") ' prompting the user to enter the width
length = InputBox("Enter the length in meters:") ' prompting the user to enter the length

' In case the user enters non-numeric values, the program will handle the error with an if statement

If IsNumeric(width) And IsNumeric(length) = True Then ' checking if both input values are numeric
