' This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop

' Define a function named "factorial" that takes in a single parameter "num"
Function factorial(num)
    ' Declare "result" variable and initialize it to 1
    Dim result: result = 1
    ' Use a for loop with initial value of 2, condition of "num" + 1, and increment of 1
    For i = 2 To num + 1 Step 1
        ' Multiply "result" by current value of loop variable "i"
        result = result * i
    Next
    ' Return the factorial value stored in the "result" variable
    factorial = result
End Function

' Define a variable "num" and assign a value
Dim num: num = 6
' Call the "factorial" function with "num" as the argument and store the returned value in "factorial_result" variable
Dim factorial_result: factorial_result = factorial(num)

' Print the result using a message box
MsgBox "Factorial of " & num & " is " & factorial_result
