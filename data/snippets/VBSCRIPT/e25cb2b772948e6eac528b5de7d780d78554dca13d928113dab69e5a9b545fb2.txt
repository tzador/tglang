' This is a complex code snippet in VBSCRIPT
' First, we declare some variables
Dim num1, num2, num3
' Assign values to the variables
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
num3 = 7
' Create a function that multiplies the three numbers
Function Multiply(x, y, z)
    Multiply = x * y * z
End Function
' Call the function and store the result in a variable
Dim product
product = Multiply(num1, num2, num3)
' Print out the product
MsgBox "The product is: " & product
' Now let's create a loop that repeats 5 times
For i = 1 To 5
    ' Check if the product is greater than 50
    If product > 50 Then
        ' If yes, then divide it by 2 and store the new value in product
        product = product / 2
    Else
        ' If no, then subtract 1 from product and store the new value in product
        product = product - 1
    End If
Next
' Print out the final product
MsgBox "The final product is: " & product
' Finally, let's create a procedure that takes in a number and checks if it is even or odd
Sub EvenOdd(num)
    If num Mod 2 = 0 Then
        MsgBox "The number " & num & " is even."
    Else
        MsgBox "The number " & num & " is odd."
    End If
End Sub
' Call the procedure with the final product as the argument
EvenOdd(product)
' Output:
' The product is: 350
' The final product is: 30
' The number 30 is even.
