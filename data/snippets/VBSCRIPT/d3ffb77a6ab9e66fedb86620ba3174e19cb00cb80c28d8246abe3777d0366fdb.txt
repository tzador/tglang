' This code snippet demonstrates a nested loop to generate a multiplication table from 1 to 10
' Each multiplication row is represented by a nested loop, multiplying the current row number with values from 1 to 10

For i = 1 to 10 ' First loop for rows
  For j = 1 To 10 ' Nested loop for columns
    product = i * j ' Multiply current row number with current column number
    ' Print the product with proper formatting
    If product < 10 Then ' 1 digit numbers
      WScript.StdOut.Write "  " & product & "     "
    ElseIf product < 100 Then ' 2 digit numbers
      WScript.StdOut.Write "  " & product & "    "
    Else ' 3 digit numbers
      WScript.StdOut.Write "  " & product & "   "
    End If
  Next ' End of nested loop for columns

  WScript.StdOut.WriteLine ' Move to next line for next multiplication row
Next ' End of first loop for rows
