' This code snippet demonstrates the use of conditional statements and looping in VBScript

' Declare and set an initial value for a variable
Dim i
i = 1

' Set up a conditional statement that will execute the code within if the condition is met
If i < 10 Then

    ' Use a 'for' loop to perform a task multiple times
    For i = 1 To 10 Step 2

        ' Print out the value of the variable using the built-in 'MsgBox' function
        MsgBox "The value of i is: " & i

    Next

' Set up an 'else' statement to handle the condition if it is not met
Else

    ' Print out a message if the condition is not met
    MsgBox "i is not less than 10"

End If

' Use a 'do while' loop to perform a task while the condition is met
Do While i <= 10

    ' Use a 'select case' statement to handle multiple conditions
    Select Case i

        ' Check if the value of the variable is equal to 5
        Case 5

            ' Print out a message if the value is equal to 5
            MsgBox "The value of i is equal to 5"

        ' Check if the value of the variable is equal to 10
        Case 10

            ' Print out a message if the value is equal to 10
            MsgBox "The value of i is equal to 10"

        ' If the value does not meet the above conditions, execute the following code
        Case Else

            ' Print out the value of the variable
            MsgBox "The current value of i is: " & i

    End Select

    ' Increase the value of the variable by 1
    i = i + 1

Loop

' Use a 'do until' loop to perform a task until the condition is met
Do Until i > 15

    ' Check if the value is divisible by 3 using the modulus operator
    If i Mod 3 = 0 Then

        ' Print out a message if the value is divisible by 3
        MsgBox "i is divisible by 3"

    End If

    ' Increase the value of the variable by 1
    i = i + 1

Loop

' Use a 'while' loop to perform a task while the condition is met
While i < 20

    ' Check if the value is divisible by 4 using the modulus operator
    If i Mod 4 = 0 Then

        ' Print out a message if the value is divisible by 4
        MsgBox "i is divisible by 4"

    End If

    ' Increase the value of the variable by 1
    i = i + 1

' Create a function that will add two numbers and return the result
Function AddNumbers(num1, num2)

    ' Set up local variables within the function
    Dim total

    ' Add the two numbers together and store the result in the 'total' variable
    total = num1 + num2

    ' Return the result
    AddNumbers = total

End Function

' Call the 'AddNumbers' function and pass in two numbers as arguments
' Print out the result using the built-in 'MsgBox' function
