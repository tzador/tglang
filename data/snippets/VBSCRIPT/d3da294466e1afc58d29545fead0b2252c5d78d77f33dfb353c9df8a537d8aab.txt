' This code snippet uses VBScript to calculate the factorial of a given number.
' The factorial of a number is the product of all numbers from 1 to that number.
' For example, the factorial of 5 would be 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

' Input: Number for which factorial needs to be calculated
Dim number
number = InputBox("Please enter a number:")

' Initializing variables to store the factorial and a counter
Dim factorial
factorial = 1
Dim i

' Loop through numbers from 1 to the given number
For i = 1 To number
    ' Multiply the factorial variable with the current number
    factorial = factorial * i
Next

' Output: Print the factorial of the given number to the console
MsgBox "The factorial of " & number & " is " & factorial & "."

' Sample Output: If the input number is 5, the output would be:
' The factorial of 5 is 120.
