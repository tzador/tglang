' This is a simple code snippet in VBScript that prints out a random number
' between 1 and 10.

' In VBScript, the `Randomize` function is used to initialize the random number
' generator with a seed value based on the system timer. This ensures that each
' time the program is run, a new random number will be generated.

' The `Int()` function is used to round down the decimal values to integers,
' ensuring that the final output will be a whole number.

' The `MsgBox` function is used to display the final output in a message box.

' The output displayed will be in the format "Random number generated: <number>".
' Change the number after `Int()` to specify the maximum range for the random number.
