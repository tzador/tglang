' This program calculates the area of a circle
' Input the radius of the circle
radius = InputBox("Enter the radius of the circle:", "Circle Area Calculator")
' Convert the radius to a numeric value
radius = CDbl(radius)
' Calculate the area using the formula A = πr²
area = 3.1415 * radius * radius
' Output the result to the user
MsgBox "The area of the circle with radius " & radius & " is " & area, , "Circle Area"
' Check if the area is greater than 50
If area > 50 Then
    MsgBox "The area is greater than 50."
' Check if the area is less than 50
ElseIf area < 50 Then
    MsgBox "The area is less than 50."
' If the area is exactly 50, output a special message
Else
    MsgBox "The area is exactly 50! Wow!"
End If
' Thank the user for using the program
MsgBox "Thank you for using the Circle Area Calculator!", , "End of Program"
