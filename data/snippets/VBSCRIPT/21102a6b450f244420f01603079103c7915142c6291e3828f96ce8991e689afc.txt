' "VBSCRIPT" is a scripting language that supports a wide range of
' programming tasks. It is commonly used to automate tasks in Windows
' operating systems, including creating and managing files and folders.

' In this code snippet, we will create a simple program that prompts
' the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting.

' To start, we will define a function that will take in a string
' parameter for the user's name and return a greeting message.

Function getGreeting(name)

    ' Define a variable to hold the greeting message.
    Dim greeting

    ' Use the '&' operator to concatenate the name onto the greeting.
    ' The '&" symbol is used for string concatenation in VBSCRIPT.
    greeting = "Hello " & name & ", welcome to VBSCRIPT!"

    ' Return the greeting message.
    getGreeting = greeting

End Function

' Now, we will prompt the user for their name using the built-in
' 'InputBox' function. This function displays a prompt for the
' user to input a value. We will pass in the string "Enter your
' name:" as the prompt message.

' We will then assign the input value to a variable called 'userName'.
userName = InputBox("Enter your name:")

' Next, we will call the 'getGreeting' function and pass in the
' 'userName' variable as an argument. This will return the
' personalized greeting message.
greetingMsg = getGreeting(userName)

' Finally, we will use the 'MsgBox' function to display the greeting
' message to the user in a dialog box. We will pass in the greeting
' message variable as the text to be displayed.

' The 0 parameter indicates that the dialog box will have the
' default OK button.
MsgBox(greetingMsg, 0)
