' This VBScript code snippet demonstrates how to create and use a class with properties and methods 
' Declare the class with the Class statement 
Class Vehicle
    ' Declare a private field for the vehicle's make
    Private m_make
    
    ' Declare a private field for the vehicle's model
    Private m_model
    
    ' Declare a private field for the vehicle's year
    Private m_year
    
    ' Declare a private field for the vehicle's color
    Private m_color
    
    ' Declare a constructor for the class, which sets initial values for the fields
    Public sub Class_Initialize()
        m_make = "Ford"
        m_model = "Mustang"
        m_year = "2020"
        m_color = "Red"
    End Sub
    
    ' Declare a property for the vehicle's make
    Public property Get Make
        Make = m_make
    End Property
    
    ' Declare a property for the vehicle's model
    Public property Get Model
        Model = m_model

    ' Declare a property for the vehicle's color
    Public property Get Color
        Color = m_color
    End Property
    
    ' Declare a method to accelerate the vehicle
    Public sub Accelerate()
        ' Code to increase speed
    End Sub
    
    ' Declare a method to brake the vehicle
    Public sub Brake()

' Create an instance of the Vehicle class
Dim myCar

MsgBox "Make: " & myCar.Make & vbNewLine & "Model: " & myCar.Model & vbNewLine & "Year: " & myCar.Year & vbNewLine & "Color: " & myCar.Color

' Call the Accelerate and Brake methods to demonstrate how they work
myCar.Accelerate
