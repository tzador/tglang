' This VBScript code snippet calculates the factorial value of a given number
' and displays the result
' Input: num - number whose factorial value needs to be calculated
' Output: factorial value of the input number

Dim num ' declare variable to store input number

InputBox "Enter a number to calculate factorial:", num ' prompt user for input

Dim result ' declare variable to store factorial value
result = 1 ' initialize with base value

' loop through all numbers from input number down to 1
For i = num To 1 Step -1

    result = result * i ' update factorial value with each iteration

Next

' display result to user
MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & result

' end of code snippet
