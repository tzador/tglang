' This code snippet uses VBScript to create a function that calculates the factorial of a given number. 

' To begin, we declare our function and give it a name, "CalculateFactorial"
Function CalculateFactorial(num)
' Next, we define a variable for our result and set it equal to 1. 
Dim result
result = 1
' We then use a For Loop to iterate through each number from 1 to our given number. 
For i = 1 to num
' Each time the loop runs, we multiply the current result by the current loop number.
result = result * i
Next
' Finally, we return the result of our factorial calculation.
CalculateFactorial = result
' End of the function.
End function

' To test our function, we can call it and pass in a number of our choice. 
' In this example, we will use 6.
CalculateFactorial 6 ' Output: 720

' This code snippet is now complete.
