' This code snippet uses VBScript to create an object and perform calculations on it
' and then output the results to the console

' Create a function that takes in two parameters, 'num1' and 'num2'
Function calculate(num1, num2)
    ' Create an object using the 'CreateObject()' method
    ' The object in this case is the 'Scripting.Dictionary' object
    Set dict = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")
    ' Add key-value pairs to the dictionary object
    dict.Add "Num1", num1
    dict.Add "Num2", num2
    ' Get the values of 'Num1' and 'Num2'
    val1 = dict("Num1")
    val2 = dict("Num2")
    ' Perform calculations on the values and store the results in variables
    sum = val1 + val2
    difference = val1 - val2
    product = val1 * val2
    quotient = val1 / val2
    ' Output the results to the console using the 'MsgBox()' method
    MsgBox "The sum of " & val1 & " and " & val2 & " is " & sum
    MsgBox "The difference between " & val1 & " and " & val2 & " is " & difference
    MsgBox "The product of " & val1 & " and " & val2 & " is " & product
    MsgBox "The quotient of " & val1 & " and " & val2 & " is " & quotient
End Function

' Call the function and pass in two numbers as arguments
calculate 5, 2

' Output:
'
'The sum of 5 and 2 is 7
'The difference between 5 and 2 is 3
'The product of 5 and 2 is 10
'The quotient of 5 and 2 is 2.5
