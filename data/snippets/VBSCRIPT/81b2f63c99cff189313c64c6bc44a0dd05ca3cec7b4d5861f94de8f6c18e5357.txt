' This code snippet demonstrates how to create a basic for loop in VBScript

' First, we declare a variable to hold the value we want to iterate through
Dim i

' Next, we use the For...Next loop to set the iteration parameters
For i = 0 To 10 Step 2
    ' The iteration starts at 0, goes up to (and including) 10, and increments by 2 each time
    ' This means that the loop will run 6 times, with the values of i being: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
    ' Step 2 could also be written as i = i + 2

    ' Within the loop, we can perform whatever operations we want using the current value of i
    ' In this case, we simply print out the value of i
    MsgBox "Current value of i is: " & i
