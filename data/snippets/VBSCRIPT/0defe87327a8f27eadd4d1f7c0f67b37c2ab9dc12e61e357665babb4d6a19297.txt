' This program calculates and prints the factorial of a given number
' Input: number - the number whose factorial is to be calculated
' Output: factorial - the factorial of the input number

' Initialize variables for factorial and number
Dim factorial, number

' Prompt user to enter a number
number = InputBox("Enter a number to calculate its factorial:")

' Convert string input to integer
number = CInt(number)

' Check if input is a positive integer
If number < 0 Then
    MsgBox "Factorial is not defined for negative integers! Please enter a positive integer."
    
' Calculate factorial if input is 0 or a positive integer
Else
    factorial = 1
    
    ' Loop through numbers from 1 to input
    For i = 1 To number
        factorial = factorial * i
    Next
    
    ' Print factorial
    MsgBox "The factorial of " & number & " is " & factorial & "."
