' This is a simple VBScript program that generates a random number
' between 1 and 10 and prompts the user to guess it.
' If the user's guess is correct, the program will congratulate them,
' otherwise it will keep prompting for guesses until the correct number is guessed.

' Declare variables
Dim randomNumber, userGuess

' Generate random number between 1 and 10
randomNumber = Int((10 * Rnd) + 1)

' Prompt user to enter a guess
userGuess = InputBox("Guess a number between 1 and 10")

' Loop until correct number is guessed
Do While StrComp(userGuess, randomNumber, vbBinaryCompare) <> 0

    ' Check if user's guess is lower than the random number
    If userGuess < randomNumber Then
        ' Prompt user to guess higher
        userGuess = InputBox("Incorrect. Guess higher")
    ' Check if user's guess is higher than the random number
    ElseIf userGuess > randomNumber Then
        ' Prompt user to guess lower
        userGuess = InputBox("Incorrect. Guess lower")
    End If

    ' Prompt user for another guess
    userGuess = InputBox("Guess again")

Loop

' If loop is exited, user guessed correctly
MsgBox "Congratulations, you guessed the correct number!"
