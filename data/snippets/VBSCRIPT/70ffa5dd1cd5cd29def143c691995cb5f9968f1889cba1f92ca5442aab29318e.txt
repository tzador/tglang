' This code snippet uses VBScript to solve a system of linear equations
' by creating and solving a matrix equation.

' Define variables for coefficients and constants of the linear equations
Dim a, b, c, d, e, f
a = 2
b = 3
c = 4
d = 5
e = 6
f = 7

' Create a 2x2 matrix with the coefficients
Dim matrix(1,1)
matrix(0,0) = a
matrix(0,1) = b
matrix(1,0) = c
matrix(1,1) = d

' Create a vector with the constants
Dim vector(1)
vector(0) = e
vector(1) = f

' Calculate the determinant of the matrix
Dim det
det = (a * d) - (b * c)

' Check if the determinant is non-zero (determinant cannot be 0 for a unique solution)
If det = 0 Then
    MsgBox "The system of equations has no unique solution."
    Exit Sub
End If

' Create the inverse of the matrix
Dim invMatrix(1,1)
invMatrix(0,0) = d / det
invMatrix(0,1) = (-b) / det
invMatrix(1,0) = (-c) / det
invMatrix(1,1) = a / det

' Multiply the inverse of the matrix with the vector of constants to solve for the variables
Dim solution(1)
solution(0) = invMatrix(0,0) * vector(0) + invMatrix(0,1) * vector(1)
solution(1) = invMatrix(1,0) * vector(0) + invMatrix(1,1) * vector(1)

' Print the solution to the console
MsgBox "The solution to the system of equations is x = " & solution(0) & " and y = " & solution(1) & "."

' Output:
'
