' This code snippet shows how to use nested for loops to calculate factorial values
Option Explicit
Dim num, fact, i, j ' declaring variables to store input, factorial and loop counters
num = InputBox("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: ") ' getting input from user
fact = 1 ' initializing factorial value
For i = 1 to num ' for loop to iterate from 1 to user input number
    For j = 1 to i ' nested for loop to iterate from 1 to current value of i
        fact = fact * j ' calculating factorial by multiplying current value with previous factorial values

MsgBox "Factorial of " & num & " is " & fact ' displaying result using message box
