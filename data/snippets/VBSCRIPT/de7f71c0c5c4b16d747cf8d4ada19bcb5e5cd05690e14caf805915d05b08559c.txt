' This code snippet is an example of a function that takes in two parameters,
' checks if the first parameter is divisible by the second parameter,
' and returns a message indicating whether it is or not

Function CheckDivisible(num1, num2)

    If num1 Mod num2 = 0 Then ' checks if num1 is divisible by num2
        CheckDivisible = "The first number is divisible by the second number."
    Else
        CheckDivisible = "The first number is not divisible by the second number."
    End If

End Function

MsgBox CheckDivisible(10, 2) ' returns "The first number is divisible by the second number."
MsgBox CheckDivisible(7, 3) ' returns "The first number is not divisible by the second number."

'verify that the returned messages are correct by changing the parameters
MsgBox CheckDivisible(6, 4) ' returns "The first number is divisible by the second number."
MsgBox CheckDivisible(8, 5) ' returns "The first number is not divisible by the second number."
