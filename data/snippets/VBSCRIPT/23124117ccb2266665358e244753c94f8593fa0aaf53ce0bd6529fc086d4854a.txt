' This code snippet creates a function called "fibonacci" that calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
' It takes one parameter, "n", which is the position of the number in the sequence to be calculated
Function fibonacci(n)

' Initialize variables for the first two numbers in the sequence as well as the current and previous numbers
Dim firstNum
Dim secondNum
Dim currentNum
Dim prevNum

' Set the first two numbers in the sequence to 0 and 1, respectively
firstNum = 0
secondNum = 1

' Use a for loop to iterate through the sequence and calculate the nth number
For i = 3 to n
    ' Set the current number to the sum of the previous two numbers
    currentNum = firstNum + secondNum
    ' Update the previous two numbers for the next iteration
    firstNum = secondNum
    secondNum = currentNum
Next

' Return the calculated number as the output of the function
fibonacci = currentNum

End Function

' Call the function to calculate the 10th number in the sequence and store it in a variable
Dim result
result = fibonacci(10)

' Print the result to the console
MsgBox "The 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence is " & result
