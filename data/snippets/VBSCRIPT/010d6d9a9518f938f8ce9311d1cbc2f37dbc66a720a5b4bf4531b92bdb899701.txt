''' This code snippet checks if a given number is prime or not
''' Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves
''' This snippet uses a brute force approach to check all possible divisors of the given number

Option Explicit

'User input for number to be checked'
Dim number
number = InputBox("Enter a positive integer:")

'Check if number is positive'
If number <= 0 Then
    MsgBox "Please enter a positive integer"
    WScript.Quit
End If

'Variable to store number of divisors'
Dim num_divisors
num_divisors = 0

'Loop through all numbers from 1 to given number'
For i = 1 To number
    'Check if current number is a divisor'
    If number Mod i = 0 Then
        'Increment number of divisors'
        num_divisors = num_divisors + 1
    End If
Next

'Check if number has exactly 2 divisors'
If num_divisors = 2 Then
    MsgBox number & " is a prime number"
Else
    MsgBox number & " is not a prime number"
End If

''' Example output:
''' Enter a positive integer: 17
''' 17 is a prime number
