' This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
' Input: num - integer whose factorial is to be calculated
' Output: factorial of num
Function factorial(num)
    If (num = 0) Then ' base case, if num is 0 then the factorial is 1
        factorial = 1
    Else
        factorial = num * factorial(num - 1) ' recursion call, calls the function again with num decremented by 1
    End If
End Function

' Sample input and output
msgbox "The factorial of 5 is " & factorial(5) ' should output 120
msgbox "The factorial of 0 is " & factorial(0) ' should output 1
