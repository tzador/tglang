' This code snippet is a function in VBScript that returns the factorial of a given integer

Function factorial(n)
' This function takes in a single parameter n, which is the integer whose factorial we want to calculate
' The function will return the factorial as an integer
'
' Initialize a variable to store the factorial
Dim result
result = 1
' Create a loop to iterate from 1 to n
For i = 1 to n
    ' Multiply the current value of result by the current value of i
    result = result * i
Next
' Return the final calculated factorial
factorial = result
End Function
