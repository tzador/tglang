' This script uses a complex algorithm to find the factorial of a given number

' Initialize variables
Dim num
Dim fact

' Prompt user for input
num = InputBox("Enter a number to find its factorial:")

' Convert input to integer
num = CInt(num)

' Initialize result
fact = 1

' Loop through numbers from 1 to input number
For i = 1 To num
    ' Multiply result by current number
    fact = fact * i
Next

' Display output
MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & fact & "."
