'This code snippet defines a function that prints out the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two numbers
Function calculate(num1, num2)
    'Declare variables
    Dim sum, difference, product, quotient

    'Calculate sum

    'Calculate product
    product = num1 * num2

    'Check if denominator is not zero before calculating quotient
    If num2 <> 0 Then
        'Calculate quotient
        quotient = num1 / num2
