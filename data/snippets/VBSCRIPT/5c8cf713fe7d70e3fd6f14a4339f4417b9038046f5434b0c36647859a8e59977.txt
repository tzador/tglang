' This is a VBS code snippet that takes in a string and checks if it is a palindrome

Option Explicit ' ensure that all variables are declared before use

Dim str, strReverse, i ' declare three variables: str for original string, strReverse for reversed string, and i for loop counter

str = InputBox("Enter a string:") ' prompt user to input a string and assign it to str variable

For i = Len(str) to 1 Step -1 ' loop from the length of the string to 1, decreasing by 1 each time
    strReverse = strReverse & Mid(str, i, 1) ' concatenate the current character in str to strReverse
Next ' end loop

If LCase(str) = LCase(strReverse) Then ' compare the lowercase versions of both strings using the LCase function
    MsgBox "The string is a palindrome." ' if they are equal, show a message box stating that the string is a palindrome
Else ' if they are not equal
    MsgBox "The string is not a palindrome." ' show a message box stating that the string is not a palindrome
End If ' end if statement

' Note: The LCase function is used to convert the string to lowercase in order to ignore any differences in capitalization when checking for palindromes.
