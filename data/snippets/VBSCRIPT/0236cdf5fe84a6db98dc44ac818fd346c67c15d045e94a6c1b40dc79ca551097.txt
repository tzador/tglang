' This is a sample VBSCRIPT code snippet for generating a random password
' It uses the Microsoft Scripting Runtime library for accessing the FileSystemObject 
' and the Timer function for generating a random sequence

' Initializing variables for minimum and maximum length of password
Dim min_length, max_length
min_length = 8 ' minimum length of 8 characters
max_length = 12 ' maximum length of 12 characters

' Initializing variables for character sets to be used in password generation
Dim lower_alpha, upper_alpha, numbers, special_chars
lower_alpha = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" ' lower case alphabet characters
upper_alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" ' upper case alphabet characters
numbers = "0123456789" ' numbers
special_chars = "!@#$%^&*()-_+=[]{}<>,.?/~" ' special characters

' Initializing variables for password and password length
Dim password, password_length
password = "" ' empty string for storing password
password_length = Int((max_length - min_length + 1) * Rnd + min_length) ' calculating random password length

' Looping through password length and adding random characters to password
For i = 1 To password_length
    ' Generating a random number from 1 to 4 to select character set
    Randomize()
    Dim char_set
    char_set = Int((4) * Rnd + 1)

    ' Generating a random index from 0 to length of character set
    Dim char_index
    char_index = Int((Len(eval("char_set")) - 1) * Rnd)

    ' Getting the character at the generated index in the selected character set
    Dim char
    char = Mid(eval("char_set"), char_index + 1, 1)

    ' Adding the character to the password string
    password = password & char
Next

' Printing the generated password
MsgBox "Your random password is: " & password
