' This code snippet is a subroutine that calculates the factorial of a given number '
Sub Factorial(number)
	num = number ' initialize a variable to hold the value of the number '
	factorial = 1 ' initialize a variable to hold the factorial result '
	
	' use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to the given number '
	For i = 1 To num
		factorial = factorial * i ' multiply the factorial by the current number '
	Next
	
	' print the result '
	WScript.Echo "The factorial of " & num & " is " & factorial
End Sub

' call the subroutine and pass in a number to calculate its factorial '
Factorial(7) ' this will calculate the factorial of 7 '
