' This code snippet is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
Function findFactorial(number)
    ' Initialize the factorial variable
    Dim factorial: factorial = 1
    ' Loop through numbers from 1 to the given number
    For i = 1 To number
        ' Update the factorial variable
        factorial = factorial * i
    Next
    ' Return the factorial value
    findFactorial = factorial
End Function

' Example usage of the function
Dim num: num = 5 ' The number whose factorial is to be found
' Call the function and store the result in a variable
Dim result: result = findFactorial(num)
' Print the result
WScript.Echo "Factorial of " & num & " is " & result
