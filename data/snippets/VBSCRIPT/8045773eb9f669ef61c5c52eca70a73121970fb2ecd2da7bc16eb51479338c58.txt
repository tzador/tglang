<!-- This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number -->
Function factorial(num)
  If num < 0 Then 'Checks if number is negative
    factorial = "Error: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers"
  ElseIf num = 0 Then 'Checks if number is 0
    factorial = 1
  Else
    factorial = 1 'Initializes the factorial variable
    For i = num To 1 Step -1 'Loops from num to 1 in descending order
      factorial = factorial * i 'Multiplies the factorial variable by the current number
    Next
  End If
End Function

'Example usage:
'Prints the factorial of 5
