' *** This code snippet is a function that performs a Fibonacci sequence calculation up to a given number of terms ***
' *** The function takes in a single parameter, "n", which represents the number of terms to be used in the sequence ***
' *** The function returns an array of the calculated values ***

Function Fibonacci(n)
    ' Declare variables for starting values of the sequence
    Dim a, b
    a = 0
    b = 1
    
    ' Declare and initialize an empty array
    Dim fib()
    ReDim fib(n)
    
    ' Loop through the number of terms and perform calculations
    For i = 1 to n
        ' Store the value of "a" in the array
        fib(i) = a
        ' Update "a" and "b" values for the next iteration
        temp = a + b
        a = b
        b = temp
    Next
    
    ' Return the array
    Fibonacci = fib
    
End Function

' Example usage of the function
Dim sequence
sequence = Fibonacci(10)
' Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
