' This comment explains the purpose of the code snippet.
' It is a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
Function SortArray(arr)
    ' This variable will store the sorted array.
    Dim sortedArr()
    ' This loop iterates through the array.
    For i = 0 To UBound(arr) - 1
        ' This variable is used to track the index of the smallest element in the array.
        Dim min As Integer = i
        ' This loop compares the current element with the rest of the elements in the array.
        For j = i+1 To UBound(arr)
            ' If the current element is smaller than the smallest element, update the min variable.
            If arr(j) < arr(min) Then
                min = j
            End If
        Next
        ' Swap the current element with the smallest element.
        Dim temp As Integer = arr(min)
        arr(min) = arr(i)
        arr(i) = temp
    Next
    ' Return the sorted array.
