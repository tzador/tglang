' This code snippet declares two variables, num1 and num2, and assigns them values.
' It then checks if num1 is greater than num2 and prints the result accordingly.

Option Explicit ' Ensures all variables are declared before use

Dim num1, num2 ' Declaring two variables

num1 = 8 ' Assigning a value to num1
num2 = 5 ' Assigning a value to num2

If num1 > num2 Then ' Checks if num1 is greater than num2
    Wscript.Echo "num1 is greater than num2" ' Prints the result if condition is true
Else
    Wscript.Echo "num1 is not greater than num2" ' Prints the result if condition is false
