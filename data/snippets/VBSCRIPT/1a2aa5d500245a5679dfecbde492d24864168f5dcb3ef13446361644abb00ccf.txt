' This code snippet creates a function that calculates the area of a circle.
Function GetArea(radius)
    ' Use the built-in function "Round" to ensure the result is rounded to 2 decimal places.
    Dim area
    area = Round(3.14159 * (radius ^ 2), 2) 
    GetArea = area
End Function

' Outside of the function, assign a variable to hold the radius of the circle.
Dim radius
radius = 5

' Call the GetArea function and pass in the radius variable.
' Assign the result to a new variable.
Dim circleArea
circleArea = GetArea(radius)

' Print the result to the console using the built-in function "MsgBox".
MsgBox "The area of the circle with radius " & radius & " is " & circleArea
