''' This is a sample code snippet in VBScript that demonstrates various loop functions and string manipulation.
Sub LoopFunction()
    Dim words(5) 'Creating an array of 5 elements
    words(0) = "Hello" 'Assigning values to each element
    words(1) = "World"
    words(2) = "This"
    words(3) = "Is"
    words(4) = "VBScript"

    For i = 0 To 4 'Looping through the array using index
        MsgBox words(i) 'Displaying each element in a message box
    Next

    For Each word In words 'Looping through the array using For Each loop
        MsgBox UCase(word) 'Converting each element to uppercase and displaying it in a message box
    Next

    Dim sentence 'Declaring a string variable
    sentence = Join(words, " ") 'Joining the elements of the array into a string with space as delimiter
    MsgBox sentence 'Displaying the sentence in a message box

    Dim reversed 'Declaring another string variable
    For i = 4 To 0 Step -1 'Looping through the array in reverse order
        reversed = reversed & words(i) 'Adding each element to the reversed string
    Next
    MsgBox reversed 'Displaying the reversed sentence in a message box
End Sub
