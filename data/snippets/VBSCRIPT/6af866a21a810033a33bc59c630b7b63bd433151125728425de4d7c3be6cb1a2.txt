' This code snippet calculates the area of a triangle
' using the formula: area = (base * height) / 2

' Declare variables for base, height, and area
Dim base, height, area

' Prompt the user to input the base and height of the triangle
base = InputBox("Enter the base of the triangle:")
height = InputBox("Enter the height of the triangle:")

' Convert base and height to numbers
base = CDbl(base)
height = CDbl(height)

' Calculate the area of the triangle
area = (base * height) / 2

' Display the result
MsgBox "The area of the triangle is: " & area
