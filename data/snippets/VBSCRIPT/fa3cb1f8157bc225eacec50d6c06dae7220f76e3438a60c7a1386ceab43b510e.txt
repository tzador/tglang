' This code snippet demonstrates how to create a multithreaded VBScript application
' using the Win32 Thread pool and Job Objects

' Create the Win32 Job Object
Set objJob = CreateObject("WinMgmts:Win32_JobObject")
objJob.MaximumWorkingSetSize = 200000
objJob.MinimumWorkingSetSize = 100000
objJob.Name = "VBScript Job Object"

' Set the limit for maximum threads in the pool
objJob.SetInformation 7, 4

' Create the thread pool
Set objPool = CreateObject("WinMgmts:Win32_Thread")
objPool.Name = "VBScript Thread Pool"

' Create the thread pool's thread group
Set objGroup = objJob.CreateThreadGroup(Null)

' Create multiple threads and add them to the thread group
For i = 1 to 5
    Set objThread = objPool.CreateThread(Null)
    objThread.Name = "VBScript Thread " & i
    objGroup.AddThread(objThread)
Next

' Start the thread group running
objGroup.Start

' Wait for the thread group to finish
objGroup.WaitForCompletion

' Return the results
For Each objThread In objGroup.Threads
    WScript.Echo objThread.Name & " returned " & objThread.ExitCode
Next

' Clean up the thread pool and job object
objGroup.RemoveAllThreads
Set objThread = Nothing
Set objGroup = Nothing
Set objPool = Nothing
Set objJob = Nothing
