' This is a VBSCRIPT code snippet that creates a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
Function factorial(x)
    ' declare a variable to store the result
    Dim result
    result = 1 ' initialize the result to 1
    ' loop from 1 to the given number
    For i = 1 To x
        ' multiply the result by the current number in the loop
        result = result * i
    Next
    ' return the factorial result
    factorial = result
End Function
' call the function with a given number and store the result in a variable
Dim num
num = 5
Dim fact
fact = factorial(num)
' print the result
MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & fact
