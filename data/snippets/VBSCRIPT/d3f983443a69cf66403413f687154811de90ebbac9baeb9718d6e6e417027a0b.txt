' This code snippet is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive approach
' It takes in a single argument num which is the number to calculate the factorial for
Function Factorial(num)
    ' Check if num is equal to 0, if so, return 1
    If num = 0 Then
        Factorial = 1
        Exit Function
    Else
        ' Otherwise, use recursion to calculate the factorial
        ' Calling the function again with num-1 as the argument and multiplying it with the current num
        Factorial = num * Factorial(num-1)
    End If
End Function
