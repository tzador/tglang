'This is a code snippet in VBSCRIPT that creates a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
Function factorial(num)
    Dim result
    result = 1
    For i = 1 To num
        result = result * i
    Next
    factorial = result
End Function

'An example of calling the factorial function and printing the result:
Dim num
num = 5 'change this value to calculate the factorial of a different number
Print "The factorial of " & num & " is: " & factorial(num) 'prints the result in the format "The factorial of <number> is: <factorial>"
'Output: The factorial of 5 is: 120
