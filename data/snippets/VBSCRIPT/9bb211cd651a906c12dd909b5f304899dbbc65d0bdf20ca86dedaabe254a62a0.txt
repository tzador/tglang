' This code snippet generates a Fibonacci sequence
' up to the specified number of terms

' User input for number of terms
n = InputBox("Please enter the number of terms you want in the Fibonacci sequence: ")

' Converting user input to integer
n = CInt(n)

' Initializing variables for first two terms
first = 0
second = 1

' Printing the first two terms
MsgBox first
MsgBox second

' Loop to generate Fibonacci sequence
For i = 3 To n
' Calculating the third term and onwards
third = first + second
' Printing the calculated term
MsgBox third
' Updating values for next iteration
first = second
second = third
Next
