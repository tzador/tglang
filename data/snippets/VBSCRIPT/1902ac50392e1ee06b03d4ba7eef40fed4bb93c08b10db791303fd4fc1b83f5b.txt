' This code snippet generates a simple calculator using VBScript
' The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
' It also handles cases of division by zero and invalid input
Option Explicit ' ensures variables are properly declared before use
Dim num1, num2, operator ' declares variables for user input and operation
Dim result ' declares variable to store calculation result
' prompts user for first number and stores in num1 variable
num1 = InputBox("Enter first number:")
' prompts user for second number and stores in num2 variable
num2 = InputBox("Enter second number:")
' prompts user for type of operation to perform
operator = InputBox("Enter operation (+, -, *, /):")
' checks if input is a number, if not, prompts user for valid input
If Not IsNumeric(num1) Then
    MsgBox("Invalid input for first number. Please try again.")
' checks if input is a number, if not, prompts user for valid input
ElseIf Not IsNumeric(num2) Then
    MsgBox("Invalid input for second number. Please try again.")
' if input is a number, performs calculation based on operation
Else
    ' checks for division by zero case
    If operator = "/" And num2 = 0 Then
        MsgBox("Division by zero not allowed. Please enter a non-zero second number.")
    ' performs addition if operator is +
    ElseIf operator = "+" Then
        result = num1 + num2
        MsgBox("Result: " & result)
    ' performs subtraction if operator is -
    ElseIf operator = "-" Then
        result = num1 - num2
        MsgBox("Result: " & result)
    ' performs multiplication if operator is *
    ElseIf operator = "*" Then
        result = num1 * num2
        MsgBox("Result: " & result)
    ' performs division if operator is /
    ElseIf operator = "/" Then
