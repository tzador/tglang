' This code snippet shows how to create a function that calculates the average of an array of numbers in VBScript.

' Define the function with the name and parameters.
Function CalculateAverage(numbers)

    ' Declare the variables for sum and count.
    Dim sum
    Dim count

    ' Set the initial values.
    sum = 0
    count = 0

    ' Loop through the array and update the sum and count variables.
    For i = 0 To UBound(numbers)

        ' Add the current element to the sum.
        sum = sum + numbers(i)

        ' Increase the count by 1.
        count = count + 1

    Next

    ' Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count.
    Dim average
    average = sum / count

    ' Return the average value.
    CalculateAverage = average

    ' End the function.
End Function

' Create an array of numbers to test the function.
Dim numbers(5)
numbers(0) = 5
numbers(1) = 8
numbers(2) = 12
numbers(3) = 2
numbers(4) = 6
numbers(5) = 10

' Call the function and store the result in a variable.
Dim result
result = CalculateAverage(numbers)

' Print the result.
MsgBox "The average is: " & result
