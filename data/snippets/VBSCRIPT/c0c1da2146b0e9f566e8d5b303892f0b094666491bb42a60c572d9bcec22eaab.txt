' This code snippet demonstrates how to create a multidimensional array in VBScript.
'
' First, we declare an array and initialize its size. In this example, we'll create a 2x3 array.
Dim arr(2,3)

' Next, we use nested For loops to assign values to each element in the array.
For i = 0 to 1
   For j = 0 to 2
      ' Here, we use the i and j variables to access specific indexes in the array.
      arr(i,j) = i + j
   Next
Next

' Finally, we print out the array to verify its contents.
' To do this, we use the LBound and UBound functions to get the lower and upper bounds of the array respectively.
For i = LBound(arr, 1) to UBound(arr, 1)
   ' The second argument in the UBound function specifies the dimension we want to get the upper bound for.
   ' In this case, we want to get the upper bound for the first dimension, which corresponds to the rows.
   For j = LBound(arr, 2) to UBound(arr, 2)
      ' The second argument in the LBound function specifies the dimension we want to get the lower bound for.
      ' In this case, we want to get the lower bound for the second dimension, which corresponds to the columns.
      ' So, we can use this lower and upper bounds to access all the elements in the 2x3 array.
      WScript.Echo "Value at index (" & i & "," & j & ") is " & arr(i,j)
   Next
Next

' Output:
' Value at index (0,0) is 0
' Value at index (0,1) is 1
' Value at index (0,2) is 2
' Value at index (1,0) is 1
' Value at index (1,1) is 2
' Value at index (1,2) is 3
