' This code snippet generates a 2D array with random numbers and calculates their average value

Option Explicit ' ensures all variables are declared before use
Randomize ' initializes the random number generator

Dim numRows, numColumns ' declare variables to store the number of rows and columns
numRows = 5 ' set the number of rows
numColumns = 5 ' set the number of columns

Dim randomArray(numRows, numColumns) ' declare a 2D array with the specified number of rows and columns
Dim total, average ' declare variables to store the total value and average value

' loop through the array and fill it with random numbers between 1 and 10
For i = 0 To numRows - 1 ' loop through the rows
  For j = 0 To numColumns - 1 ' loop through the columns
    randomArray(i, j) = Int((10 * Rnd) + 1) ' generate a random number between 1 and 10
  Next
Next

' loop through the array and calculate the total value
For i = 0 To numRows - 1 ' loop through the rows
  For j = 0 To numColumns - 1 ' loop through the columns
    total = total + randomArray(i, j) ' add the value at each index to the total
  Next
Next

' calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of elements in the array
average = total / (numRows * numColumns)

' print the array and average value
For i = 0 To numRows - 1 ' loop through the rows
  For j = 0 To numColumns - 1 ' loop through the columns
    ' print the value at each index
    Response.Write randomArray(i, j) & " "
  Next
  ' move to the next line
  Response.Write "<br>"
Next

' print the average value
Response.Write "Average: " & average
