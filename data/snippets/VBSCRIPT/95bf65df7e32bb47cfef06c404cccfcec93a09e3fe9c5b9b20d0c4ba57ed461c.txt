The following code snippet demonstrates a function in VBScript 
that calculates the average of a list of numbers.

' Define a list of numbers to find the average of
Dim numList(5)
numList(0) = 23
numList(1) = 12
numList(2) = 45
numList(3) = 67
numList(4) = 89
numList(5) = 10

' Function to calculate average of a list of numbers
Function CalcAverage(numList())
	' Initialize variables
	Dim sum, average
	sum = 0
	average = 0
	' Loop through list and add up all numbers
	For i = 0 To UBound(numList)
		sum = sum + numList(i)
	Next
	' Calculate average by dividing sum by number of elements in list
	average = sum / (UBound(numList) + 1)
	' Print result to the console
	WScript.Echo "Average of the list is: " & average
End Function

' Call function to find average of our list
CalcAverage(numList)
