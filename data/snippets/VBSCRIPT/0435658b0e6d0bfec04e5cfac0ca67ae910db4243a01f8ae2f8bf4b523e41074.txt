' This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
Function factorial(num)
    ' Checks if the number is equal to 1 or 0
    If num = 1 Or num = 0 Then
        ' Returns 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
        factorial = 1
    ' Checks if the number is greater than 1
    ElseIf num > 1 Then
        ' Initializes a variable to hold the factorial value
        Dim facto
        ' Sets the initial value to the number
        facto = num
        ' Uses a for loop to iterate from the number-1 down to 1
        For i = num-1 To 1 Step -1
            ' Multiplies the current factorial value by the iteration number
            facto = facto * i
        Next
        ' Returns the final factorial value
        factorial = facto
    ' If the number is less than 0, returns an error message indicating invalid input
    Else
        factorial = "Invalid input, number must be equal to or greater than 0"
    End If
End Function
' Example usage of the function
msgbox factorial(5) ' Outputs 120, the factorial of 5
' Alternatively, the function can be called within another function or sub
Sub calculateFactorial()
    num = InputBox("Enter a number to calculate its factorial")
    msgbox factorial(num)
