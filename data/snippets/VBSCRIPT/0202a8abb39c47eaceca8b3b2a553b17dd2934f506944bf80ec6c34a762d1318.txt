<!-- This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number -->
Function factorial(n)
    If n = 0 Then ' If n is equal to 0, return 1
        factorial = 1
    Else
        factorial = n * factorial(n - 1) ' If n is not equal to 0, recursively call the function to multiply n by the factorial of n-1
    End If
End Function

' Example usage:
Num = 5
Result = factorial(Num) ' Calling the factorial function with a variable

' Print the result to the console
WScript.Echo "The factorial of " & Num & " is " & Result
