<!-- This is a VBScript code snippet that takes in user input and performs calculations to output the average of all the numbers entered. -->

' Define and initialize an empty array to store user input
Dim user_numbers()
' Define and initialize a counter variable to keep track of number of inputs
Dim input_counter
' Ask user to enter the number of inputs they would like to calculate the average for
MsgBox "Enter how many numbers you want to calculate the average for"
' Get user input and convert it to integer
Dim num_inputs
num_inputs = CInt(InputBox("Enter a number:"))
' Loop through the number of inputs, asking user to input a number each time
For i = 0 To num_inputs - 1
    input_counter = input_counter + 1
    user_numbers(i) = InputBox("Enter number " & input_counter & ":")
Next
' Define and initialize a variable to store the sum of all inputs
Dim sum
' Loop through the array of user inputs, converting each input to integer and adding it to the sum variable
For j = 0 To UBound(user_numbers)
    sum = sum + CInt(user_numbers(j))
Next
' Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of inputs
Dim average
average = sum / num_inputs
' Display the average to the user
MsgBox "The average of the numbers entered is: " & average & "."
' End of code snippet.
