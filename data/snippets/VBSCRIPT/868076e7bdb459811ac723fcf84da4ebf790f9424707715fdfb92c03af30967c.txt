' This program prints out the square roots of numbers from 1 to 10
' and also calculates their sum and average

' Define variables for sum and average
Dim sum, avg

' Set initial value for sum
sum = 0

' Loop through numbers 1 to 10
For i = 1 To 10

    ' Calculate square root of i and assign it to a variable
    Dim root
    root = Sqr(i)

    ' Print out the square root in a formatted string
    ' using the Round function to display only 2 decimal places
    Msgbox "The square root of " & i & " is " & Round(root, 2)

    ' Add the square root to the sum variable
    sum = sum + root
Next

' Calculate average by dividing sum by the number of numbers (10)
avg = sum / 10

' Print out the sum and average in a formatted string
Msgbox "The sum of the square roots is " & sum & ". The average is " & avg
