' VBscript code to check if a given number is prime or not
'
' This code uses the concept of a loop to check for factors of the given number
' If the number has more than two factors, it is not prime
'
' Define the number to be checked
Dim num
num = 17

' Check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to itself - 1
For i = 2 to num - 1
    ' Use mod operator to check for remainder
    ' If remainder is 0, then the number is not prime
    If num mod i = 0 Then
        ' Print message indicating that the number is not prime
        MsgBox(num & " is not a prime number.")
        ' Exit the loop
        Exit For
    End If
Next

' If the loop completes without any remainder being 0, the number is prime
If i = num Then
    ' Print message indicating that the number is prime
    MsgBox(num & " is a prime number.")
End If
