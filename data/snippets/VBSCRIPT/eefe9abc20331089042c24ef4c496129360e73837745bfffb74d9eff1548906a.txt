Option Explicit ' This statement ensures that all variables must be explicitly declared before use

Dim num1, num2 ' Declares two variables to hold numbers

num1 = 5 ' Assigns the value 5 to the variable num1
num2 = 10 ' Assigns the value 10 to the variable num2

' This section uses conditional statements to compare the two numbers and outputs the result

If num1 > num2 Then ' Checks if num1 is greater than num2
    MsgBox num1 & " is greater than " & num2 & "." ' Displays a message box with the comparison result
ElseIf num2 > num1 Then ' Checks if num2 is greater than num1
    MsgBox num2 & " is greater than " & num1 & "." ' Displays a message box with the comparison result
Else ' If both numbers are equal, this section is executed
    MsgBox num1 & " and " & num2 & " are equal." ' Displays a message box with the comparison result

' This section uses a loop to calculate the factorial of a given number

Dim num, result ' Declares two variables to hold a number and the resulting factorial

num = 5 ' Assigns the value 5 to the variable num
result = 1 ' Assigns the initial value of 1 to the variable result

' The loop runs for the number of times specified and multiplies the result variable by the current iteration number
For i = 1 To num
    result = result * i ' Multiplies the result by the current iteration number
Next ' Ends the loop

MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & result & "." ' Displays the result in a message box
