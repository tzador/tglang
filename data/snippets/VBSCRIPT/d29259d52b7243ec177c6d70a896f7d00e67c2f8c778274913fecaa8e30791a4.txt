' This code snippet demonstrates how to create a class in VBSCRIPT

' Create a class named Person
Class Person
    ' Define properties for the class
    Private FirstName, LastName, Age
    
    ' Define methods for the class
    Public Sub Initialize(fName, lName, age)
        FirstName = fName
        LastName = lName
        Age = age
    End Sub
    
    Public Sub ChangeLastName(newLastName)
        LastName = newLastName
    End Sub
    
    ' Define a property Get method for the FirstName property
    Public Property Get FirstName
        FirstName = FirstName
    End Property
    
    ' Define a property Get method for the LastName property
    Public Property Get LastName
        LastName = LastName
    End Property
    
    ' Define a property Get method for the Age property
    Public Property Get Age
        Age = Age
    End Property
End Class

' Create an instance of the Person class
Dim person1
Set person1 = New Person

' Initialize the person1 instance with values
person1.Initialize "John", "Doe", 25

' Print out the person's full name and age
MsgBox person1.FirstName & " " & person1.LastName & " is " & person1.Age & " years old."

' Change the person's last name using the ChangeLastName method
person1.ChangeLastName "Smith"

' Print out the updated last name
MsgBox "The person's last name is now " & person1.LastName
