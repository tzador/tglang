''' This is a code snippet in VBScript that creates a user-defined function to calculate the area of a rectangle.
''' The function takes in two parameters - width and length - and returns the area as a double.
Function CalculateArea(width, length)
    ''' 'Dim' is used to declare a variable.
    ''' 'As Double' specifies the data type of the variable.
    Dim area As Double
    
    ''' Calculating the area using the width and length parameters.
    area = width * length
    
    ''' The 'CalculateArea' function returns the calculated area.
    CalculateArea = area
End Function

''' This is a code snippet in VBScript that calls the 'CalculateArea' function and prints the result.
''' In this example, we are calculating the area of a rectangle with width 10 and length 5.
''' The output should be 50.
''' The 'MsgBox' function displays a message box with the result.
MsgBox "The area of the rectangle is: " & CalculateArea(10, 5)
