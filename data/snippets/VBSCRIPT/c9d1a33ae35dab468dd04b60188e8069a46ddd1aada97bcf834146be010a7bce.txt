' Syntax:
' For counter = start To end [Step step]
'    [Statements]

' Define a variable to store the counter value
Dim counter

' Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10
For counter = 1 To 10
    ' Check if the current number is even
    If counter Mod 2 = 0 Then
        ' Print the number to the console with proper indentation
        WScript.Echo "Even Number: " & counter
    End If
Next counter
