' This program calculates the area of a circle
' given the radius

' Define variables for radius and pi
Dim radius, pi

' Assign values to variables
radius = 5
pi = 3.14

' Calculate area with given formula
area = pi * radius^2

' Print result to console
MsgBox "The area of the circle is " & area

' This is a conditional statement to check if the area is greater than 25
If area > 25 Then

' If the area is greater than 25, print a message to console
MsgBox "The area is greater than 25"

' This is a nested conditional statement to check if the area is less than or equal to 50
If area <= 50 Then

' If the area is less than or equal to 50, print a message to console
MsgBox "The area is less than or equal to 50"
End If

' If the area is not greater than 25, print a message to console
Else
MsgBox "The area is not greater than 25"
End If

' This is a loop to print out multiples of the area value
For i = 1 to 5

' Multiply area by current interval and store result in new variable
Dim multiple
multiple = area * i

' Print result to console
MsgBox "The area times " & i & " is " & multiple

' This is a conditional statement to check if the multiple is an odd number
If multiple Mod 2 = 1 Then

' If the multiple is odd, print a message to console
MsgBox "The multiple is an odd number"
End If

' Go to next interval
