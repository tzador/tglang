myArray(1) = 25 'assigning numerical value to second element
myArray(2) = True 'assigning boolean value to third element
myArray(3) = "Hello World!" 'assigning text value to fourth element
myArray(4) = 3.14 'assigning numerical value to fifth element

For i = LBound(myArray) To UBound(myArray) 'looping through each element in the array
  MsgBox "Element " & i & " is: " & myArray(i) 'printing out the element with its index
