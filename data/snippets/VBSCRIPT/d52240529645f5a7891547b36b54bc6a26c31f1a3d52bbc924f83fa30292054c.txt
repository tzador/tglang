' This code snippet is a complex function in VBSCRIPT that calculates the factorial of a given number.
' It takes in one parameter, num, which is the number whose factorial needs to be calculated.

Function Factorial(num)
    ' First, we declare a variable to store the factorial result and initialize it to 1.
    Dim result
    result = 1

    ' We then use a loop to calculate the factorial.
    ' The loop starts from 2 and goes up to the value of num.
    ' Each time, the current value of num is multiplied with the result and the result is updated.
    For i = 2 To num
        result = result * i
    Next

    ' Finally, we return the calculated factorial value.
    Factorial = result
End Function

' To test this function, we can call it with a sample input and print the result to the console.
WScript.Echo "Factorial of 5 is", Factorial(5)

' The output of the above code will be:
' Factorial of 5 is 120
