' This module contains functions for calculating area and perimeter of shapes
' The code snippet is using VBSCRIPT as its programming language

'Create a shape class with attributes for shape type, length, and width
Class Shape
    Public type, length, width

    ' Constructor to initialize the shape
    Public Sub Class_Initialize()
        type = ""
        length = 0

    End Sub

    ' Function to calculate and return the area of the shape

        If type = "Square" Then
            CalculateArea = length * length
        ElseIf type = "Rectangle" Then
            CalculateArea = length * width
        ElseIf type = "Circle" Then
            CalculateArea = 3.14 * (length / 2) ^ 2
        Else
            CalculateArea = -1 'invalid shape
        End If
    End Function

    ' Function to calculate and return the perimeter of the shape

        If type = "Square" Then
            CalculatePerimeter = 4 * length
        ElseIf type = "Rectangle" Then
            CalculatePerimeter = 2 * (length + width)
        ElseIf type = "Circle" Then
            CalculatePerimeter = 2 * 3.14 * (length / 2)
        Else
