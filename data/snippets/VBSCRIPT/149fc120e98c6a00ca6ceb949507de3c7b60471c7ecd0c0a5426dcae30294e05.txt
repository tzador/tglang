' This code snippet is an example of a function that calculates the factorial of a number

' Define the function named factorial that takes in one parameter, num
Function factorial(num)
    ' Initialize a variable named result and set it to 1
    Dim result
    result = 1

    ' Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to the value of num
    For i = 1 To num
        ' Update the result by multiplying itself with the loop counter, i
        result = result * i
    Next

    ' Return the final result
    factorial = result

' End the function
End Function

' Print the result of calling the factorial function with an input value of 5
MsgBox factorial(5)
