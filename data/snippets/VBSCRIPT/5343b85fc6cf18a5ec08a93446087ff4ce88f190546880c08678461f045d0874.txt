<!-- This code snippet creates a for loop that iterates through a list of numbers and prints out their squares -->

<!-- Define a list of numbers -->
Dim numbers
numbers = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

<!-- Define the for loop -->
For i = 0 to Ubound(numbers)
    <!-- Calculate the square of the current number -->
    Dim square
    square = numbers(i) * numbers(i)

    <!-- Print out the square -->
    Msgbox "The square of " & numbers(i) & " is " & square
