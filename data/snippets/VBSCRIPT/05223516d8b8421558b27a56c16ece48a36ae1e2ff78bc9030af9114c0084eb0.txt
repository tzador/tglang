' This code snippet assigns a list of values to an array and sorts them using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Option Explicit ' Declare that all variables must be explicitly declared before use.

Dim numbers(10) ' Declare an array with 10 elements.
Dim temp ' A temporary variable for swapping values.
Dim i ' A variable for looping through the array.
Dim j ' A variable for looping through the array.

' Populate the array with random numbers.
For i = 0 To 9
	numbers(i) = Int((100 * Rnd) + 1) ' Generate a random number between 1 and 100 and assign it to the current array index.
Next

' Print out the unsorted array.
MsgBox "Unsorted Array: " & Join(numbers, ", ")

' Use Bubble Sort Algorithm to sort the array.
For i = 0 To 8 ' Only need to loop through 9 elements since the last element will already be in place.
	For j = 0 To 8 - i ' Each iteration of the outer loop, we can reduce the inner loop by 1 since the last i elements will be sorted.
		If numbers(j) > numbers(j+1) Then ' Compare adjacent elements and swap them if necessary.
			temp = numbers(j)
			numbers(j) = numbers(j+1)
			numbers(j+1) = temp
		End If

' Print out the sorted array.
