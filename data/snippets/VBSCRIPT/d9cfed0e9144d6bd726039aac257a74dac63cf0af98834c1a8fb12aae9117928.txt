'This program calculates the average of five numbers
Dim num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
Dim sum, average

'Prompt user to input five numbers
Input "Enter the first number: ", num1
Input "Enter the second number: ", num2
Input "Enter the third number: ", num3
Input "Enter the fourth number: ", num4
Input "Enter the fifth number: ", num5

'Calculate the sum of the five numbers
sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5

'Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 5
average = sum / 5

'Print out the average
Wscript.Echo "The average of " & num1 & ", " & num2 & ", " & num3 & ", " & num4 & ", and " & num5 & " is " & average

'Loop through and prompt the user to input 5 more numbers
For i = 1 to 5
