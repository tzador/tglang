' This code snippet demonstrates a function that calculates the factorial of a number.
' It takes in a positive integer as input and returns its factorial value.

Function Factorial(num)
	Dim result
	If num > 1 Then ' Checks if the number is greater than 1
		result = 1
		For i = 1 To num ' Loops from 1 to the input number
			result = result * i ' Multiplies the current result by the loop number
		Next
		Factorial = result ' Sets the function output to the final result
	Else ' If the number is 1 or less, return 1
		Factorial = 1
	End If
End Function

' Sample input and output:
msgbox "The factorial of 5 is " & Factorial(5) ' Outputs 120
msgbox "The factorial of 0 is " & Factorial(0) ' Outputs 1
msgbox "The factorial of 3 is " & Factorial(3) ' Outputs 6
msgbox "The factorial of 10 is " & Factorial(10) ' Outputs 3628800
