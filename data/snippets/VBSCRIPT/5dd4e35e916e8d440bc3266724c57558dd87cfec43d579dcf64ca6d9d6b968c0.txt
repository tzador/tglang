'''' This is a sample VBScript code snippet, showing how to create and use classes

' Create a class named "Person"
Class Person
    ' Declare private member variables
    Private name
    Private age

    ' Create a constructor method with parameters
    Public Sub Class_Initialize(name, age)
        ' Assign values to member variables
        Me.name = name
        Me.age = age
    End Sub

    ' Create a method to get the person's name
    Public Function GetName()
        ' Return the value of the name variable
        GetName = Me.name
    End Function

    ' Create a method to set the person's age
    Public Sub SetAge(new_age)
        ' Assign the new age to the age variable
        Me.age = new_age
    End Sub
End Class

' Create an instance of the Person class, passing in a name and age as arguments
Dim person1
Set person1 = New Person("John", 25)

' Get the person's name using the GetName method
Dim person_name
person_name = person1.GetName()

' Print the person's name to the console
MsgBox "Person's name is " & person_name

' Set a new age for the person using the SetAge method
person1.SetAge(30)

' Get the person's updated age using the age variable
Dim person_age
person_age = person1.age

' Print the person's age to the console
MsgBox "Person's age is " & person_age
