Dim fruits ' Declaring a variable named fruits

fruits = Array("apple", "banana", "orange") ' Initializing the array with values

For i = 0 to UBound(fruits) ' Loop through the elements in the array
	Console.WriteLine(fruits(i)) ' Print each element to the console
Next

' The output will print out "apple", "banana", "orange" on a new line for each element
