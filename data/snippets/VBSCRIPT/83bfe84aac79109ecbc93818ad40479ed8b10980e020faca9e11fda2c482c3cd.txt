' This code snippet calculates the area of a circle with the radius provided by the user

Option Explicit ' forces the explicit declaration of all variables

Dim radius, area ' declares the variables radius and area as type Variant

radius = InputBox("Enter the radius of the circle:") ' prompts the user to enter the radius of the circle and assigns it to the variable radius

If IsNumeric(radius) = False Then ' checks if the input is numeric
    MsgBox "Please enter a numeric value for the radius." ' displays an error message if the input is not numeric
Else
    area = Round(3.14 * radius * radius, 2) ' calculates the area of the circle with the formula A = Ï€ * r^2
    MsgBox "The area of the circle with radius " & radius & " is " & area ' displays the result to the user
End If

' This is the end of the code snippet. Thank you for using!
