' This code snippet is a VBScript program that performs a binary search on a sorted array of numbers

Option Explicit ' force variable declaration for better code readability and debugging

' define the array of numbers to be searched in
Dim numbers(9)
numbers(0) = 10
numbers(1) = 20
numbers(2) = 30
numbers(3) = 40
numbers(4) = 50
numbers(5) = 60
numbers(6) = 70
numbers(7) = 80
numbers(8) = 90
numbers(9) = 100

' define the number to be searched for
Dim searchNumber
searchNumber = 40

' define the lower and upper bound of the array
Dim lowerBound
lowerBound = 0
Dim upperBound
upperBound = 9

' define a function for performing the binary search
Function binarySearch(searchArray, searchItem)
    ' loop until lower bound becomes greater than upper bound
    Do While lowerBound <= upperBound
        ' calculate the middle index of the array
        Dim middleIndex
        middleIndex = (lowerBound + upperBound) \ 2
        ' check if the middle number is equal to the search item
        If searchArray(middleIndex) = searchItem Then
            ' return the index of the middle number
            binarySearch = middleIndex
            Exit Function
        End If
        ' check if the middle number is greater than the search item
        If searchArray(middleIndex) > searchItem Then
            ' adjust the upper bound to the middle index minus one
            upperBound = middleIndex - 1
        Else ' if middle number is less than search item
            ' adjust the lower bound to the middle index plus one
            lowerBound = middleIndex + 1
        End If
    Loop
    ' if search item is not found, return -1
    binarySearch = -1
End Function

' call the binary search function passing in the array and search number
Dim result
result = binarySearch(numbers, searchNumber)

' check if result is equal to -1, indicating the search item was not found
If result = -1 Then
    ' display message indicating search item was not found
    MsgBox "Search item was not found"
Else ' if result is not equal to -1
    ' display message with the index where the search item was found
    MsgBox "Search item was found at index " & result
End If

' Output:
' This program will display a message indicating whether or not the search item was found in the array. If found, it will display the index where it was found.

' Output Example:
' "Search item was found at index 3"
