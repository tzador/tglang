<!-- This code snippet demonstrates how to use VBScript to create an array and loop through its elements -->

' Initialize the array with some values
myArray = Array("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape")

' Loop through the array and print each element
For i = 0 To UBound(myArray)
    ' Output the current element
    Msgbox "The current fruit is: " & myArray(i)

    ' Check if the current element is the last element in the array
    If i = UBound(myArray) Then
        Msgbox "This is the last element in the array."
    End If
Next

' Add a new element to the end of the array
ReDim Preserve myArray(UBound(myArray) + 1)
myArray(UBound(myArray)) = "pineapple"

' Loop through the array again and print the updated version
For i = 0 To UBound(myArray)
    Msgbox "The current fruit is: " & myArray(i)
Next

' Sort the array alphabetically
For i = 0 To UBound(myArray)
    For j = i + 1 To UBound(myArray)
        If myArray(i) > myArray(j) Then
            ' Swap the elements
            temp = myArray(i)
            myArray(i) = myArray(j)
            myArray(j) = temp
        End If
    Next
Next

' Loop through the array again and print the sorted version
For i = 0 To UBound(myArray)
    Msgbox "The current fruit is: " & myArray(i)
Next
