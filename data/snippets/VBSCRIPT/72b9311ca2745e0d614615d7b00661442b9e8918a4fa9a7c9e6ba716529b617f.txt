'This snippet assigns values to variables and uses conditionals and loops to manipulate the data

'Create three variables to store data
Dim value1
Dim value2
Dim value3

'Set initial values for the variables
value1 = 5
value2 = 10
value3 = 15

'Use a conditional statement to check if value1 is less than value2
If value1 < value2 Then
    'If the condition is true, print a message
    MsgBox "Value1 is less than value2"
Else
    'If the condition is false, print a different message
    MsgBox "Value1 is not less than value2"
End If

'Use a loop to increment the value of value3
For i = 1 To 5
    'Add 1 to value3 for each iteration
    value3 = value3 + 1
Next i

'Print the final value of value3
MsgBox "The final value of value3 is " & value3

'Create an array to store values
Dim myArray(5)

'Assign values to the array
myArray(0) = "Value 1"
myArray(1) = "Value 2"
myArray(2) = "Value 3"
myArray(3) = "Value 4"
myArray(4) = "Value 5"

'Use a loop to print each value in the array
For j = 0 To 4
    'Print the value at the current index
    MsgBox "The value at index " & j & " is " & myArray(j)
Next j
