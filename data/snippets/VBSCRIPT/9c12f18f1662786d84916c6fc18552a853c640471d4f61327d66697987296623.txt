'This code snippet is a simple calculator program in VBScript.
'First, we declare two variables to store the numbers entered by the user.
Dim num1, num2 

'Next, we prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in the variable "num1".
num1 = InputBox("Enter first number:") 

'After that, we prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in the variable "num2".
num2 = InputBox("Enter second number:") 

'Next, we declare two more variables to store the result of the calculations.
Dim sum, difference

'The following lines of code perform basic arithmetic operations on the two numbers entered by the user.
'In this case, we are adding the numbers and storing the result in the "sum" variable.
sum = num1 + num2

'On the other hand, we are subtracting the second number from the first and storing the result in the "difference" variable.
difference = num1 - num2

'Finally, we use the "MsgBox" function to display the results of the calculations to the user.
'In this case, we are displaying the sum and difference of the two numbers entered.
MsgBox "The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & sum & "." 
MsgBox "The difference between " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & difference & "."
