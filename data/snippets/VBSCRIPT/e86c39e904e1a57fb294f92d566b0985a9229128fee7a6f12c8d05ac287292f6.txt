' This is a complex code snippet that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion in VBSCRIPT.

' Function to calculate factorial using recursion
Function factorial(n)
    If n = 0 Then
        factorial = 1    ' Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    Else
        factorial = n * factorial(n-1)    ' Recursive call to calculate factorial
    End If
End Function

' Input number to calculate factorial
n = 5

' Call function to calculate factorial
fact = factorial(n)

' Print result
MsgBox "Factorial of " & n & " is " & fact
