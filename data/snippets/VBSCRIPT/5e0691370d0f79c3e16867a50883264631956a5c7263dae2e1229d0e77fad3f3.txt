' This VBScript code creates a simple calculator '

Option Explicit ' forces the declaration of all variables before use

' Declaring and initializing variables for user input
Dim firstNumber ' declares a variable for first number
Dim secondNumber ' declares a variable for second number
Dim operation ' declares a variable for the operation to be performed

' Prompting user for input and storing it in the previously declared variables
firstNumber = InputBox("Enter first number: ") ' prompts user for first number and stores it in firstNumber variable
secondNumber = InputBox("Enter second number: ") ' prompts user for second number and stores it in secondNumber variable
operation = InputBox("Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ") ' prompts user for operation and stores it in operation variable

' Converting input strings to numbers for calculation
firstNumber = CDbl(firstNumber) ' converts firstNumber from string to double
secondNumber = CDbl(secondNumber) ' converts secondNumber from string to double

' Performing the selected operation and storing the result in a variable
Dim result ' declares a variable for the result of the calculation

If operation = "+" Then ' checks if operation is addition
    result = firstNumber + secondNumber ' performs addition and stores result in result variable
ElseIf operation = "-" Then ' checks if operation is subtraction
    result = firstNumber - secondNumber ' performs subtraction and stores result in result variable
ElseIf operation = "*" Then ' checks if operation is multiplication
    result = firstNumber * secondNumber ' performs multiplication and stores result in result variable
ElseIf operation = "/" Then ' checks if operation is division
    result = firstNumber / secondNumber ' performs division and stores result in result variable
End If

' Displaying the result to the user
MsgBox "Result is: " & result ' displays a message box with the result of the calculation
