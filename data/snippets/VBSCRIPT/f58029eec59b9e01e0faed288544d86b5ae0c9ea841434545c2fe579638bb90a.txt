' This code snippet is used to check if a given number is prime or not
' The script takes input from the user and uses a nested for loop to check for factors

' Function to determine if a number is prime or not
Function IsPrime(number)
    ' Set a flag variable to track the result
    prime = True
    ' Check for factors using a nested for loop
    For i = 2 To (number / 2)
        For j = 2 To (number / 2)
            ' If the number is divisible by any number other than itself and 1, it is not prime
            If i * j = number Then
                prime = False
                Exit For
            End If
        Next
    Next
    ' If the flag variable is still True, the number is prime
    If prime = True Then
        ' Output a message stating that the number is prime
        MsgBox(number & " is a prime number.")
    Else
        ' Output a message stating that the number is not prime
        MsgBox(number & " is not a prime number.")
    End If
End Function

' Take input from the user
input = InputBox("Enter a number:")

' Call the IsPrime function with the input as an argument
IsPrime(input)

' Output:
' If the input number is prime:
' Message box stating "input is a prime number."
' If the input number is not prime:
' Message box stating "input is not a prime number."
