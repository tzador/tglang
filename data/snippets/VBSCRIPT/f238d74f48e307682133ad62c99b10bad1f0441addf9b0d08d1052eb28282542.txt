' This code snippet creates a function that checks if a given number is a prime number
Function CheckPrimeNumber(num)
	Dim flag, i
	flag = True ' flag variable to track if num is prime
	For i = 2 To num / 2 ' loop through all possible factors of num
		If num Mod i = 0 Then ' if num is divisible by any factor, it is not prime
			flag = False ' set flag to false and exit loop
			Exit For
		End If
	Next
	If flag = True Then ' if flag is still true, num is prime
		CheckPrimeNumber = "The number '" & num & "' is a prime number." ' return this message
	Else ' otherwise, num is not prime
		CheckPrimeNumber = "The number '" & num & "' is not a prime number." ' return this message
	End If
End Function

' You can call the function and check if a number is prime like this:
MsgBox CheckPrimeNumber(11) ' Output: "The number '11' is a prime number."

' This code snippet also includes an example of passing an argument by reference
Dim x
x = 5 ' initialize x variable
Sub Increment(ByRef num) ' create a sub that increments a number by 1
	num = num + 1 ' increment num by 1
End Sub

Increment x ' call the sub and pass x by reference, so its value is changed
MsgBox "The new value of x is " & x ' Output: "The new value of x is 6"
