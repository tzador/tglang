' This is a VBSCRIPT code snippet that creates a function to calculate the factorial of a number

' Function that calculates the factorial of a number
Function factorial(number)
    ' Initialize result variable
    Dim result
    ' Check if number is 0 or 1
    If number = 0 Or number = 1 Then
        ' Set result to 1
        result = 1
    Else
        ' Initialize factorial variable and set to 1
        Dim factorial
        factorial = 1
        ' Loop through numbers from 2 to the input number
        For i = 2 to number
            ' Multiply factorial by current number
            factorial = factorial * i
        Next
        ' Set result to factorial
        result = factorial
    End If
    ' Return result
    factorial = result
End Function

' Call the factorial function with an input value of 5 and print the result
MsgBox "Factorial of 5 is " & factorial(5)
