' This code snippet creates a function called "calculateArea" that calculates the area of a given rectangle.

Function calculateArea(length, width)
' The "calculateArea" function takes in two parameters, "length" and "width".
' These parameters are used to calculate the area of the rectangle.

	Dim area ' Declaring a variable called "area" to store the calculated area.
	area = length * width ' Using the formula for calculating area, store the result in the "area" variable.

	' Printing the calculated area to the console for debugging purposes.
	WScript.Echo "The area of the rectangle is: " & area 

	' Returning the calculated area as the result of the function.
	calculateArea = area
	
End Function
