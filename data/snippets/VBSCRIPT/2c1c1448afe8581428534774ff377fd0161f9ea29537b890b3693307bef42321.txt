' Declare a variable of type String
Dim myString
' Initialize variable with value
myString = "Hello world!"

' Create a For loop to iterate through the string
For i = 1 To Len(myString)
    ' Get the character at the current index
    currentChar = Mid(myString, i, 1)
    ' Check if the character is a vowel using a Select Case statement
    Select Case currentChar
        Case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u"
            ' If it is a vowel, print it out with square brackets around it
            Response.Write("[" & currentChar & "]")
        Case Else
            ' If it is not a vowel, print it as is
            Response.Write(currentChar)
    End Select
