' This is a code snippet written in VBScript language
' It performs a simple calculation and outputs the result

' Define variables to store the input numbers
Dim num1, num2

' Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in num1 variable
num1 = InputBox("Enter the first number")

' Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in num2 variable
num2 = InputBox("Enter the second number")

' Convert the input strings to numbers for calculation
num1 = CInt(num1)
num2 = CInt(num2)

' Perform the calculation and store the result in a variable called "result"
result = num1 + num2

' Print the result to the user
MsgBox "The result is: " & result
