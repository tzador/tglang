' This code snippet creates a simple shopping list using arrays, loops, and user input.
' It prompts the user to enter items, add them to the shopping list, and then print out the final list.

' Create an empty array to store the shopping list
Dim shoppingList()

' Prompt the user to enter the number of items to add to the list
inputValue = InputBox("Enter the number of items you would like to add to your shopping list:")

' Convert the input value to an integer and store it in a variable
numItems = CInt(inputValue)

' Use a loop to iterate through the number of items and prompt the user for each item
For i = 0 to numItems-1
    item = InputBox("Enter item #" & (i+1) & ":")
    ' Add the item to the shopping list array
    shoppingList(i) = item
Next

' Print out the final shopping list
MsgBox "Your shopping list contains the following items:" & vbNewLine & Join(shoppingList, vbNewLine)
