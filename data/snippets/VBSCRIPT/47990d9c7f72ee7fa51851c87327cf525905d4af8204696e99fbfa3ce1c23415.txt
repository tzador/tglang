' This is a simple program in VBScript that displays the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence

Option Explicit

' Define variables to store the first and second number of the sequence
Dim num1, num2

' Initialize the variables with the first two numbers of the sequence
num1 = 0
num2 = 1

' Print the first number (0) of the sequence
MsgBox "Fibonacci Sequence: " & num1, vbInformation, "Number 1"

' Print the second number (1) of the sequence
MsgBox "Fibonacci Sequence: " & num2, vbInformation, "Number 2"

' Use a loop to calculate and print the next 8 numbers of the sequence
For i = 3 To 10

    ' Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
    Dim next_num
    next_num = num1 + num2

    ' Update the values of num1 and num2 to continue the sequence
    num1 = num2
    num2 = next_num

    ' Print the next number in the sequence
    MsgBox "Fibonacci Sequence: " & next_num, vbInformation, "Number " & i
