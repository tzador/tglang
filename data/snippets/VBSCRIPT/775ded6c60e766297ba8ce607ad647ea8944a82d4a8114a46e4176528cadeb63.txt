' This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number using a While loop
' The input number is stored in the variable "num" 
' The loop continues till the value of "num" becomes 1 
' The factorial is calculated by multiplying each number in descending order till num reaches 1
' The final result is stored in the variable "factorial"

Dim num, factorial
num = 5 ' input number
factorial = 1 ' initializing factorial with 1

While(num <> 0) ' loop continues till num becomes 1
    factorial = factorial * num ' multiplying factorial with num
    num = num - 1 ' decrementing num by 1
Wend

MsgBox "Factorial of " & num & " is: " & factorial ' displaying result using message box
