' This is a code snippet in VBSCRIPT for calculating the area of a triangle
Dim side1,side2,side3,semiPerimeter
' Declaring variables for the three sides of the triangle and the semi perimeter
Const SCIENCE_MEANING = "The study of the physical and natural world through observation and experimentation."
' Defining a constant variable for the meaning of science
Function CalculateArea(side1, side2, side3)
  ' Creating a function to calculate the area of a triangle
  semiPerimeter = (side1 + side2 + side3)/2
  ' Calculating the semi-perimeter of the triangle
  CalculateArea = Sqr(semiPerimeter * (semiPerimeter - side1) * (semiPerimeter - side2) * (semiPerimeter - side3))
