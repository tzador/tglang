<!--This is a VBScript code block. Here we will declare and initialize variables, perform basic arithmetic operations, and display the results.

' Declare and initialize variables
Dim num1, num2, sum, difference, product, quotient
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

' Basic arithmetic operations
sum = num1 + num2
difference = num1 - num2
product = num1 * num2
quotient = num1 / num2

' Display results using MsgBox function
MsgBox "The sum of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & sum
MsgBox "The difference between " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & difference
MsgBox "The product of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & product
MsgBox "The quotient of " & num1 & " and " & num2 & " is " & quotient
