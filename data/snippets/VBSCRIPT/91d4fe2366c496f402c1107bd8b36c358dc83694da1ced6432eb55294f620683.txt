' This code snippet uses a loop to print the first 10 even numbers
' using VBScript's 'For' loop and 'Step' keyword

' Create a variable to hold the number of even numbers to print
Dim numToPrint
numToPrint = 10

' Create a counter variable to count the number of even numbers printed
Dim count
count = 1

' Use a 'For' loop with a 'Step' of 2 to print the even numbers
For i = 0 to numToPrint * 2 Step 2
    ' Check if the current number is even
    If i mod 2 = 0 Then
        ' Print the even number and increase the count variable
        WScript.Echo "Even Number " & count & ": " & i
        count = count + 1
    End If

    ' Stop the loop when the required number of even numbers have been printed
    If count > numToPrint Then
        Exit For
    End If
Next

' Output:
' Even Number 1: 0
' Even Number 2: 2
' Even Number 3: 4
' Even Number 4: 6
' Even Number 5: 8
' Even Number 6: 10
' Even Number 7: 12
' Even Number 8: 14
' Even Number 9: 16
' Even Number 10: 18
