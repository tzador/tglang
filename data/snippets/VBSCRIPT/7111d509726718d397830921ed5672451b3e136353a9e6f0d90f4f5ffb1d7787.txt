'This code snippet demonstrates an algorithm to find the factorial of a given number
'Factorial is defined as the product of all the numbers from 1 to the given number
'For example, factorial of 5 would be 5*4*3*2*1 = 120

'Create a function called "factorial" that takes in a single parameter, "num"
Function factorial(num)

    'Set "result" variable equal to 1, as the initial value of factorial is always 1
    Dim result
    result = 1

    'Create a for loop that starts at 1 and goes up to the value of "num"
    For i = 1 to num

        'Multiply "result" by the current value of "i" in each iteration
        result = result * i

    'End the for loop
    Next

    'Print the result of the factorial calculation
    MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is: " & result

'End the factorial function
End Function

'Call the factorial function with the value of 5 as the argument
factorial(5)

'Output:
'The factorial of 5 is: 120
