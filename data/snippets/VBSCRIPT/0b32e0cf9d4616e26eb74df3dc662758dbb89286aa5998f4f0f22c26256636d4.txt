' This code snippet creates a function that calculates the average of three numbers

' Define the function name as "calculate_average" and set up the parameters
Function calculate_average(num1, num2, num3)

' Calculate the sum of the three numbers
Dim sum
sum = num1 + num2 + num3

' Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 3
Dim average
average = sum / 3

' Return the calculated average
calculate_average = average

End Function

' Call the function and pass in three numbers as arguments
calculate_average(5, 10, 15)

' The output will be the average of the three numbers, in this case: 10.
' This snippet allows for the function to be used with any three numbers, making it reusable and efficient.
