'VBScript code for calculating the factorial of a number

'create an input box to get the number from the user
num = InputBox("Enter a number to calculate its factorial")

'convert the input to an integer
num = CInt(num)

'initialize the result variable
result = 1

'create a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to the input number
For i = 1 To num

    'multiply the result with the current number
    result = result * i

Next

'display the result to the user
MsgBox "The factorial of " & num & " is " & result
