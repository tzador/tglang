' This is a VBScript code snippet that creates a function to calculate the area of a circle
Function CalculateArea(radius)
	Dim pi ' defining a variable for pi
	pi = 3.14159265359 ' assigning the value of pi
	Dim area ' defining a variable for area
	area = pi * radius * radius ' calculating the area
	CalculateArea = area ' returning the area
End Function

' This is a VBScript code snippet that calls the CalculateArea function and prints the result to the console
radius = 5 ' assigning a value to the radius variable
WScript.Echo "The area of a circle with radius " & radius & " is " & CalculateArea(radius) ' printing the result to the console using the WScript object
' Output: `The area of a circle with radius 5 is 78.539816339745`.
