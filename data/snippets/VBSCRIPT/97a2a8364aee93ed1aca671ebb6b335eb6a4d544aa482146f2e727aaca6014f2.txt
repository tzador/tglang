''' This code is used to calculate the area of a triangle using the length of its sides
Dim side1, side2, side3, s, area
' Declare variables for the three sides, total length and area

side1 = 5 ' Set the value of side1
side2 = 9 ' Set the value of side2
side3 = 12 ' Set the value of side3
s = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2 ' Calculate the total length by adding the three sides and dividing by 2

' Calculate the area using Heron's formula
area = Sqr(s * (s - side1) * (s - side2) * (s - side3))

' Display the results
MsgBox "The area of the triangle is: " & area ' Show a message box with the calculated area
