' * This code snippet creates an instance of Microsoft Excel application and adds a new workbook.
'
' * First, we declare our variables to store the instance of Excel and the workbook object.
Dim xlApp, xlBook
' * Next, we use the "CreateObject" function to create a new instance of Excel and assign it to our "xlApp" variable.
Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
' * We use the "Visible" property to make the Excel application visible on the screen.
xlApp.Visible = True
' * Now, we use the "Workbooks" collection and the "Add" method to create a new workbook and assign it to our "xlBook" variable.
Set xlBook = xlApp.Workbooks.Add()
' * We can then use the "Worksheets" collection to access the workbook's worksheets and add data to them.
xlBook.Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1").Value = "Hello"
xlBook.Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("B1").Value = "World"
' * Finally, we save the workbook using the "SaveAs" method and close the Excel application.
xlBook.SaveAs "C:\Users\Documents\NewWorkbook.xlsx"
xlApp.Quit
' * We release the memory used by the objects by setting them to "Nothing".
Set xlBook = Nothing
Set xlApp = Nothing
