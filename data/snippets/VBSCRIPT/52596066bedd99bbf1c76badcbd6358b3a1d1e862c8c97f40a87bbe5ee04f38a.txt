' This is a complex VBScript code snippet to calculate Fibonacci series

' Creating variables for first two numbers of the Fibonacci series
firstNum = 0
secondNum = 1

' Creating an input box for user to enter the number of terms they want in the series
numberOfTerms = InputBox("Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci series: ", "Fibonacci Series")

' Converting the input into integer
numberOfTerms = CInt(numberOfTerms)

' Creating a variable to store the sum of the series
sum = 0

' Using a for loop to generate the series
For i = 1 to numberOfTerms Step 1
    ' Checking for the first term
    If(i = 1) Then
        ' Printing the first term
        document.write(firstNum)
        
        ' Adding first and second term to get the sum
        sum = firstNum + secondNum
    
    ' Checking for the second term
    ElseIf(i = 2) Then
        ' Printing the second term
        document.write(secondNum)

        ' Adding second term and the previous sum to get the new sum
        sum = secondNum + sum

    ' For all other terms
    Else
        ' Printing the sum
        document.write(sum)
        
        ' Swapping the values of second and the new sum
        secondNum = sum
        sum = secondNum + firstNum
        
        ' Swapping the second and the first number
        firstNum = secondNum - firstNum
        
    ' Ending the if-else statement
    End If

' Ending the for loop
Next

' Printing the final sum of the series
document.write("The final sum of the Fibonacci series is " & sum)
