' This is a VBScript code snippet that calculates the factorial of a given number
Option Explicit ' ensures that variables are declared before use

' Function to calculate factorial of a given number
Function Factorial(ByVal num)
    Dim result ' variable to store the factorial result
    result = 1 ' initialize result to 1
    If num = 0 Then 
        Factorial = result ' if num is 0, return 1 as the factorial
    Else
        For i = 1 To num ' if num is not 0, use a for loop to iterate from 1 to the num
            result = result * i ' multiply result by current loop number
        Next
        Factorial = result ' return the final result as the factorial
    End If
End Function

' Example usage: calculate the factorial of 5 and print the result
Dim num ' variable to store the number
num = 5 ' initialize num to 5
Dim factorialResult ' variable to store the factorial result
factorialResult = Factorial(num) ' call the Factorial function with num as the argument
WScript.Echo "Factorial of " & num & " is: " & factorialResult ' print the result to the console
