' This is a VBScript program that defines a class and uses it to perform calculations
' This class takes in two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

    ' Addition method adds the two numbers and returns the result
    Function addition()
        addition = num1 + num2

    ' Subtraction method subtracts the second number from the first and returns the result
    Function subtraction()
        subtraction = num1 - num2 
    End Function 
    
    ' Multiplication method multiplies the two numbers and returns the result
    Function multiplication()
        multiplication = num1 * num2 
    End Function 
    
    ' Division method divides the first number by the second and returns the result
    Function division()

' Create an instance of the Calculator class
Set calc = New Calculator 

' Assign values to the two numbers
calc.Class_Initialize(5, 2) 

' Call the addition method and print the result
WScript.Echo "The sum of " & calc.num1 & " and " & calc.num2 & " is " & calc.addition() 

' Call the subtraction method and print the result
WScript.Echo "The difference between " & calc.num1 & " and " & calc.num2 & " is " & calc.subtraction() 

' Call the multiplication method and print the result
WScript.Echo "The product of " & calc.num1 & " and " & calc.num2 & " is " & calc.multiplication() 

' Call the division method and print the result
WScript.Echo "The quotient of " & calc.num1 & " divided by " & calc.num2 & " is " & calc.division() 

' Output:
'
' The sum of 5 and 2 is 7 
' The difference between 5 and 2 is 3 
' The product of 5 and 2 is 10 
' The quotient of 5 divided by 2 is 2.5
