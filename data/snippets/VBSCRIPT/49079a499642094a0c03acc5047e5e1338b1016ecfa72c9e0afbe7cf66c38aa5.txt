' This program demonstrates a complex algorithm for finding the sum of the first n numbers

' Define a variable to store the value of n
Dim n 

' Prompt user to enter a value for n
n = InputBox("Enter a number:") 

' Convert n to an integer and store it in a variable
Dim num
num = CInt(n)

' Define a variable to store the final sum
Dim sum
sum = 0

' Use a for loop to iterate through the first n numbers
For i = 1 To num Step 1

    ' Calculate the sum by adding the current number to the previous sum
    sum = sum + i
    
    ' Print each iteration to the console for debugging
    WScript.Echo "Current sum: " & sum

Next

' Display the final sum to the user
MsgBox "The sum of the first " & num & " numbers is: " & sum

' Output:
'
