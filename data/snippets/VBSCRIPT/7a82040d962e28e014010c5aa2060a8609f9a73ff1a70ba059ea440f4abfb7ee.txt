' This is a commented line in VBScript
' This code snippet demonstrates a for loop that calculates the factorial of a given number
' Input: num - the number whose factorial needs to be calculated
' Output: the factorial of the given number

' Prompt user for input
num = InputBox("Enter a number:")

' Convert input to integer
num = CInt(num)

' Initialize variables
fact = 1
count = 1

' For loop to calculate factorial
For i = 1 to num
    fact = fact * i
Next

' Output result to user
MsgBox(num & "! = " & fact)
