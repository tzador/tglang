' This code snippet shows an example of a function that calculates the factorial of a number

Function Factorial(num)

' Checks if the number is equal to 0, returns 1 if it is
If num = 0 Then 
    Factorial = 1 

' Checks if the number is equal to 1, returns 1 if it is
ElseIf num = 1 Then 
    Factorial = 1 
    
' If the number is greater than 1, starts the factorial calculation
ElseIf num > 1 Then
    Dim result ' Declares a variable to store the factorial result
    result = 1 ' Initializes the variable with 1
    
    ' Loop through numbers from 2 to the given number
    For i = 2 To num
        result = result * i ' Updates the result by multiplying it with the current number
    Next
    
    Factorial = result ' Returns the final factorial result
    
' If the number is negative, raises an error
Else 
    Err.Raise 5,,"Factorial of a negative number is not defined."
End If 

End Function

' Example of calling the function and printing the result
Dim num
num = 6
MsgBox "Factorial of " & num & " is " & Factorial(num) ' Prints "Factorial of 6 is 720"
