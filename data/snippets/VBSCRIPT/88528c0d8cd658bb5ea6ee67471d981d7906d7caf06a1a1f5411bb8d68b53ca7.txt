' This is a comment in VBScript.

' VBScript variables are declared using the Dim statement.
Dim strName	' Declaring a string variable named "strName".
Dim intAge		' Declaring an integer variable named "intAge".
Dim dblPrice	' Declaring a double variable named "dblPrice".

' VBScript constants are declared using the Const statement.
Const MAX_AGE = 100		' Declaring a constant named "MAX_AGE" with a value of 100.

' VBScript arrays are declared using the Dim statement and can be multi-dimensional.
Dim arrNames(5)			' Declaring a one-dimensional array with 5 elements.
Dim arrMatrix(2,2)		' Declaring a two-dimensional array with 3 rows and 3 columns.

' VBScript also supports creating and using objects.
Dim objHTTP		' Declaring an object variable.

' VBScript code can be executed using the Execute statement.
Execute "intAge = 25"	' Assigning a value of 25 to the intAge variable.

' VBScript also has loops and conditional statements.
For i = 1 to 10		' For loop that iterates from 1 to 10.
	arrNames(i) = "Name " & i	' Assigning values to array elements.
Next

If intAge > MAX_AGE Then	' Conditional statement.
	dblPrice = 100	' Assigning a value to the dblPrice variable.
Else
	dblPrice = 50	' Assigning a different value to the dblPrice variable.
End If

' VBScript supports function and subroutines.
Function CalculateTotal(intQuantity, dblUnitPrice)	' Declaring a function with parameters.
	CalculateTotal = intQuantity * dblUnitPrice	' Returning a value from the function.
End Function

Sub DisplayTotal(dblPrice)	' Declaring a subroutine with a parameter.
	MsgBox "The total price is " & dblPrice	' Displaying a message box.
End Sub

' VBScript also has built-in functions and properties.
strName = InputBox("Enter your name:")	' Prompting user for input and storing it in a variable.
intDigits = Len(12345)	' Getting the length of a string or number.

' VBScript also supports error handling.
On Error Resume Next	' Continues execution after an error.
Err.Raise 6	' Generating a custom error code.

' It is important to clean up resources when done.
Set objHTTP = Nothing	' De-allocating an object variable.

' VBScript also has special keywords such as Exit, Continue, and Exit Function.
Exit For	' Exits a loop.
Continue For	' Skips the rest of the code in a loop and starts the next iteration.
Exit Sub	' Exits a subroutine without executing the rest of the code.
