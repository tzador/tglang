' This code snippet creates a random number between 1 and 10 and checks if it is even or odd

Option Explicit 'Ensures variables are declared before use

Dim num 'Declares a variable to hold the random number
num = Int((10 * Rnd) + 1) 'Uses the Rnd function to generate a random number between 1 and 10

If num Mod 2 = 0 Then 'Checks if the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is equal to 0 (even number)
    Response.Write("The number " & num & " is even.") 'Outputs the number and a message using the Response object
Else
    Response.Write("The number " & num & " is odd.")
