Function CalculateSum(firstNumber, secondNumber)
    ' This function takes two numbers as parameters and calculates their sum
    Dim sum ' Declare a variable to hold the sum
    sum = firstNumber + secondNumber ' Calculate sum and assign to variable
    CalculateSum = sum ' Return the calculated sum
End Function

Dim number1, number2, result ' Declare variables to hold user input and function result

WScript.StdOut.Write "Enter the first number: "
number1 = WScript.StdIn.ReadLine ' Read user input for first number

WScript.StdOut.Write "Enter the second number: "
number2 = WScript.StdIn.ReadLine ' Read user input for second number

result = CalculateSum(number1, number2) ' Call the function to calculate the sum
WScript.StdOut.Write "The sum of " & number1 & " and " & number2 & " is: " & result ' Print the result to the console
