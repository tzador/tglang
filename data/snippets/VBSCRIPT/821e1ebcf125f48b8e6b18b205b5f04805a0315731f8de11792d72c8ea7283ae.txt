'This code snippet calculates the sum of even numbers from 1 to user specified limit
Option Explicit 'forces variable declaration, preventing typos
Dim limit, total, i 'variables to store input, sum and index
total = 0 'initialize sum to 0
limit = InputBox("Enter the limit:") 'prompt user for input and store in limit variable
For i = 1 To limit Step 1 'loop from 1 to limit, increasing by 1
    If i Mod 2 = 0 Then 'check if number is even
        total = total + i 'if even, add to total
    End If
Next 'go to next number
MsgBox "The sum of even numbers from 1 to " & limit & " is " & total 'display message with sum
