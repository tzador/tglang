SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_amount) AS total_spend
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING total_spend > 500
ORDER BY total_spend DESC;

-- This SQL query selects the customer ID and their total orders amount,
-- calculates the total spend per customer using the SUM function,
-- groups the data by customer ID,
-- filters out any customers with a total spend less than 500,
-- and finally sorts the results in descending order based on total spend.
