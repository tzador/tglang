/* This is a query to join two tables and filter the results */

SELECT t1.id, t1.name, t2.address, t2.city, t2.country
FROM table1 AS t1
INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
WHERE t1.age > 18 AND t2.country = 'USA'
ORDER BY t1.name DESC, t2.city ASC;

/* Explanation: 
  This code snippet uses the SQL SELECT statement to retrieve data from two tables - 'table1' and 'table2'. 
  It uses the t1 and t2 aliases to make the code more readable.
  The INNER JOIN keyword is used to combine data from both tables based on their 'id' columns.
  The WHERE clause is used to specify certain conditions for the data, in this case, retrieving records where the person's age is greater than 18 and they live in the USA.
  The data is further sorted using the ORDER BY clause, with t1.name in descending order and t2.city in ascending order.
