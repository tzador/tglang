/* --- Explanation ---
1. This query uses a SELECT statement to choose specific columns from the customers table.
2. It also uses an INNER JOIN to link the customers table with the orders table in order to retrieve data from both tables.
3. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include orders made within the past month.
4. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by customer ID, first name, and last name.
5. The HAVING clause filters the results to only include customers with at least one order in the past month.
6. Finally, the COUNT() function is used to calculate the total number of orders for each customer.
