INNER JOIN GDP ON GDP.country_id = Country.id -- joins the country and gdp table on the country_id column

WHERE GDP.gdp_year BETWEEN YEAR(GETDATE())-10 AND YEAR(GETDATE()) -- selects data only from the last 10 years
GROUP BY Country.country_name, YEAR(GDP.gdp_year) -- groups the data by country name and GDP year
ORDER BY AVG(GDP.gdp / Population.population) DESC -- orders the data in descending order based on the average GDP per capita
