/*
This query retrieves all product names and their corresponding categories from the products table,
where the category names start with the letter 'A'.

Explanation: This query uses the SELECT statement to retrieve specific columns from the products table. 
The DISTINCT keyword ensures that duplicate product names are not included in the output.
The FROM clause specifies the table to retrieve data from.
The WHERE clause filters the results based on the condition set, where the category name starts with 'A'.
The ORDER BY clause sorts the results in ascending order based on the product name.
