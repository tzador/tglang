CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INTEGER,

-- This SQL code snippet creates a table called "orders" with six columns: order_id, customer_id, product_name, total_price, order_date, and status. The order_id column is set as the primary key and will auto-increment. The customer_id and order_id columns are both set as integer data types, while the product_name and status columns are set as string data types with a maximum length of 50 and 20 characters, respectively. The total_price column is set as a decimal with a precision of 10 digits and a scale of 2, allowing for a maximum value of 9999999.99. The order_date column is set as a date data type. Lastly, a foreign key constraint is added on the customer_id column, referencing the customer_id column in the customers table.
