-- This is a complex SQL query that joins multiple tables and uses subqueries for filtering data

SELECT od.order_id, od.product_id, c.customer_name, c.customer_address, p.product_name, p.product_price 
FROM order_details od
-- Join the order_details table with the orders table to get the customer_id
INNER JOIN orders o ON o.order_id = od.order_id 
-- Join the order_details table with the products table to get the product_id
INNER JOIN products p ON p.product_id = od.product_id 
-- Join the customers table with the orders table to get the customer name and address for each order
INNER JOIN customers c ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
-- Use a subquery to filter for orders with a total of at least $100
WHERE o.order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM orders GROUP BY order_id HAVING SUM(product_price) >= 100)
-- Use a subquery to filter for only orders that contain a specific product
AND o.order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM order_details WHERE product_id = 123)
-- Order the results by customer name in ascending order
ORDER BY c.customer_name ASC;
