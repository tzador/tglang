-- This code snippet will join two tables in a SQL database and return the results
SELECT t1.column1, t1.column2, t2.column3, t2.column4
FROM table1 t1
INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.column1 = t2.column1
-- The INNER JOIN keyword ensures that only rows with matching values in both tables are returned
WHERE t1.column2 = "value"
-- This WHERE condition filters the results by a specified value in column2 of table1
ORDER BY t2.column3
-- This ORDER BY clause sorts the results based on the values in column3 of table2 in ascending order
