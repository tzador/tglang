-- This is a complex code snippet in SQL

-- Create a table called 'sales' with columns for customer id, product id, quantity, and date
CREATE TABLE sales (
    customer_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    date DATE
);

-- Insert data into the 'sales' table
INSERT INTO sales VALUES (1, 101, 5, '2020-01-01');
INSERT INTO sales VALUES (2, 102, 3, '2020-01-03');
INSERT INTO sales VALUES (3, 103, 2, '2020-01-05');
INSERT INTO sales VALUES (4, 104, 10, '2020-01-07');
INSERT INTO sales VALUES (5, 105, 7, '2020-01-09');

-- Retrieve data from the 'sales' table for customers who purchased more than 5 products
SELECT * 
FROM sales 
WHERE quantity > 5;

-- Join the 'sales' table with the 'products' table to get the product names
SELECT sales.date, products.name, sales.quantity 
FROM sales 
INNER JOIN products ON sales.product_id = products.id 
WHERE sales.quantity > 5 
ORDER BY sales.date DESC;

-- Calculate total sales for each product
SELECT products.name, SUM(sales.quantity) AS "Total Sales"
FROM sales 
INNER JOIN products ON sales.product_id = products.id 
GROUP BY products.name 
ORDER BY "Total Sales" DESC;
