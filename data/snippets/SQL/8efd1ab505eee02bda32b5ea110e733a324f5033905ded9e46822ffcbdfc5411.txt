/*
This SQL code uses the SELECT statement to retrieve the names of authors and the sum of the prices of all their books. 
It does this by first creating an alias 'a' for the authors table and an alias 'b' for the books table, and then joining them using the INNER JOIN keyword, matching the id column in the authors table with the author_id column in the books table.
Next, it creates an alias 'p' for the prices table and joins it with the books table using INNER JOIN, matching the book_id column in the prices table with the id column in the books table.
The code then uses the GROUP BY statement to group the data by the author's name, and the HAVING clause to filter the results by only including authors whose total book prices are greater than 1000.
Finally, the results are sorted in ascending order by the author's name using the ORDER BY statement.
