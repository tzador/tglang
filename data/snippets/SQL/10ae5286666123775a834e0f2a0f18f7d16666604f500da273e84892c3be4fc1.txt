-- This is a code snippet for creating a table with different data types and constraints in SQL.

CREATE TABLE employee (                            -- Creates a table named 'employee'
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,                         -- Creates a primary key column of integer data type
    emp_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,                  -- Creates a column of variable character data type with a length of 50 and not allowing null values 
    emp_position ENUM('Manager', 'Supervisor', 'Staff') DEFAULT 'Staff',  -- Creates a column of enumerated data type with default value set to 'Staff'
    emp_salary DECIMAL(8,2) CHECK(emp_salary > 0),   -- Creates a column of decimal data type with precision of 8 and scale of 2 and adds a check constraint to ensure the value is greater than 0
    emp_department VARCHAR(50),                     -- Creates a column of variable character data type with a length of 50
    emp_hire_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,        -- Creates a column of date data type with default value set to current date
    emp_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,                -- Creates a column of boolean data type with default value set to true
    emp_email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,                   -- Creates a column of variable character data type with a length of 50 and adds a unique constraint
    emp_phone_number CHAR(10)                       -- Creates a column of character data type with a length of 10
);

/*
The above code snippet creates a table named 'employee' with several different data types and constraints. The emp_id column is set as the primary key, emp_name is set as a variable character data type with a length of 50 and not allowing null values, emp_position is set as an enumerated data type with a default value of 'Staff', emp_salary is set as a decimal data type with precision of 8 and scale of 2 and a check constraint is added to ensure the value is greater than 0, emp_department is set as a variable character data type with a length of 50, emp_hire_date is set as a date data type with a default value of current date, emp_active is set as a boolean data type with a default value of true, emp_email is set as a variable character data type with a length of 50 and a unique constraint is added, and emp_phone_number is set as a character data type with a length of 10.
