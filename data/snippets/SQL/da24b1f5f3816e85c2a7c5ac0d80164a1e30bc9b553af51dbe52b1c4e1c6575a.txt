CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    address VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INTEGER,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);
-- This is a SQL code snippet that creates a table called 'employees' with columns for id, name, address, department_id, and salary.
-- The id column is set as the primary key and will automatically increment for each new entry.
-- The name and address columns are set as VARCHAR types with specified lengths.
-- The department_id column will store integer values and is a foreign key referencing the id column of the 'departments' table.
-- The salary column is set as a DECIMAL type with a maximum of 10 digits and 2 decimal places.
-- This table can then be used to store data on the employees of a company, including their names, addresses, departments, and salaries.
