-- This query will create a table called 'Students' with columns for 'Name', 'Age', and 'Major'
CREATE TABLE Students (
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- specifying data type and requiring non-null values 
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 0), -- using a check constraint to ensure age is a positive integer 
    Major VARCHAR(255) -- no restriction on data type or nullability for this column

-- This query will insert rows into the 'Students' table
INSERT INTO Students (Name, Age, Major) VALUES
('John Smith', 21, 'Computer Science'),

-- This query will select all students whose age is greater than or equal to 20 and whose major is not Computer Science
SELECT Name, Age, Major
