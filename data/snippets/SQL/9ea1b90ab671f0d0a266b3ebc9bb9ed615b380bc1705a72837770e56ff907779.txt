/* This code snippet creates a table called "customers" with the following columns:
 - customer_id: An integer that automatically increments as new records are added
 - name: A mandatory string with a maximum length of 50 characters
 - email: A mandatory string with a maximum length of 50 characters that must be unique for each record
 - address: A mandatory string with a maximum length of 100 characters
 - city: A string with a maximum length of 20 characters
 - state: A string with a maximum length of 20 characters
 - zip_code: A string with a maximum length of 10 characters, must follow the format [number][letter][letter] [number][letter][letter]
 - country: A mandatory string with a maximum length of 50 characters, must be one of the listed options
The table's primary key is the customer_id column and the unique_email constraint ensures that each email is unique in the table. The check_zipcode constraint validates the format of the zip code and the check_country constraint ensures that the country is one of the listed options. */
