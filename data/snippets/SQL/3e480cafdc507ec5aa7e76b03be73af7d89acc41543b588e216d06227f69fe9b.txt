-- This code creates a table called "students" if it does not already exist,
-- with columns for student_id, name, age, gender, major, and GPA. The student_id
-- serves as the primary key and is auto-incremented. The name and age are both
-- required fields, while the gender can only be 'male', 'female', or 'other'.
-- The major column is a VARCHAR that will reference the major_id column in a
-- separate table called "majors". The gpa column is a decimal with 3 digits
-- total, and 2 decimal places. Finally, the last line creates a foreign key
-- constraint that links the student's major to the major_id in the majors table.
