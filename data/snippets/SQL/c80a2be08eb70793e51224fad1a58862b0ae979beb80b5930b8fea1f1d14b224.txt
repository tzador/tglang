-- This is a complex SQL query to get the total cost of all orders based on their product ID and quantity
SELECT SUM(order_details.product_price * order_details.quantity) AS total_cost -- Selecting the total cost by multiplying the product price and quantity of each order
FROM orders -- Joining the orders and order_details tables
INNER JOIN order_details ON orders.id = order_details.order_id
GROUP BY order_details.product_id -- Grouping the orders by their product ID
ORDER BY total_cost DESC -- Sorting the results in descending order by total cost
LIMIT 10; -- Limiting the results to the top 10 highest total costs
