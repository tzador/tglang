-- This is a complex SQL code snippet that shows a query to retrieve data from multiple tables and perform calculations on them

SELECT
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS 'full_name', -- This adds a new column called 'full_name' by combining the 'first_name' and 'last_name' columns
    COUNT(*) AS 'total_orders', -- This counts the total number of orders for each person
    (SELECT AVG(quantity) FROM order_details WHERE order_id = orders.id) AS 'avg_quantity', -- This sub-query calculates the average quantity for each specific order
    (CASE -- This case statement checks the total quantity of an order and assigns a label based on the value
        WHEN order_details.quantity > 100 THEN 'Large Order'
        WHEN order_details.quantity > 50 THEN 'Medium Order'
        ELSE 'Small Order'
    END) AS 'order_size'
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id -- This joins the 'orders' table with the 'customers' table based on the customer ID
LEFT JOIN order_details ON orders.id = order_details.order_id -- This left join retrieves the order details for each order
WHERE orders.date > '01-01-2021' -- This filters the results to only include orders made after 01-01-2021
GROUP BY orders.id -- This groups the results by the order ID
HAVING total_orders > 5 -- This filters the results to only include orders with more than 5 items
ORDER BY avg_quantity DESC, total_orders ASC -- This orders the results first by the average quantity in descending order and then by the total orders in ascending order
LIMIT 10; -- This limits the number of results to 10
