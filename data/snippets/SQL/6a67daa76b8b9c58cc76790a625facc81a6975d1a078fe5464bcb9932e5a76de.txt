-- This code snippet uses a complex query to select the top 10 most viewed articles from a news website, along with the corresponding author and total view count.
SELECT articles.title, authors.name, top_articles.views
FROM articles
JOIN
    (SELECT path, count(*) AS views
    FROM log
    GROUP BY path
    HAVING path != '/'
    AND path != '/404'
    ORDER BY views DESC
    LIMIT 10) AS top_articles
ON articles.slug = substring(top_articles.path FROM 10)
JOIN authors ON articles.author = authors.id
ORDER BY top_articles.views DESC;
