/*
This code creates a table named 'employees' with columns for employee data such as ID, name, email, phone number, hire date, job ID, salary, commission percentage, manager ID, and department ID. The first column is defined as an integer data type with a constraint of NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY, ensuring that each entry has a unique ID and cannot be empty. The next three columns are defined as VARCHAR data types with a maximum length of 50 characters and a constraint of NOT NULL, ensuring that each entry has a valid name and email. The phone number column is defined as a VARCHAR data type with a max length of 15 characters to allow for different phone number formats. The hire date column is defined as a DATE data type with a constraint of NOT NULL, ensuring that each entry has a valid date. The job ID column is defined as a VARCHAR data type with a max length of 10 characters, and it also has a constraint of NOT NULL, ensuring that each entry has a valid job ID. The salary column is defined as a REAL data type with a constraint of NOT NULL, ensuring that each employee has a valid salary. The commission percentage column is defined as a REAL data type and allows for entries of NULL, meaning not all employees may have a commission. The manager ID column is defined as an integer data type, and the department ID column is also defined as an integer data type with a constraint of NOT NULL, ensuring that each entry has a valid department ID. Lastly, two foreign key constraints are added, linking the job ID and department ID columns to their corresponding tables.
