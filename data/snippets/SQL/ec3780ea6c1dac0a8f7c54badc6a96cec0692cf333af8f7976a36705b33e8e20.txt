-- This code snippet joins two tables (orders and customers) to get the total sales by customers for a specific date range

SELECT c.customer_name, SUM(o.order_total) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-01-31'
GROUP BY c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
