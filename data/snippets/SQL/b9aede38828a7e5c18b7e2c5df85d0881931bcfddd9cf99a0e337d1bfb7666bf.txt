-- This is a complex SQL query that retrieves customer information
-- from a database table called "customers" and joins it with a
-- table called "purchases" to get details about each customer's past purchases

SELECT c.name, c.address, p.product_name, p.purchase_date
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN purchases p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE c.registered_date > '2020-01-01'
ORDER BY p.purchase_date DESC;
-- ^ This query selects the customer's name and address, along with the product name and purchase date
-- It does this by joining the 'customers' table with the 'purchases' table on the customer_id column
-- The WHERE clause filters out any customers who registered before January 1st, 2020
-- Finally, the results are sorted in descending order by the purchase date
