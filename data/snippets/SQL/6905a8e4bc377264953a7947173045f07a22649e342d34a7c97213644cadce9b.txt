/* This is a complex SQL query that retrieves data from multiple tables and performs calculations */

SELECT customer.customer_id, customer.name, SUM(order.total_price) AS total_spent
FROM customer
INNER JOIN order
ON customer.customer_id = order.customer_id
INNER JOIN product
ON order.product_id = product.product_id
WHERE product.category = 'Electronics'
GROUP BY customer.customer_id
HAVING total_spent > 1000
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

/* Explanation:
- The DISTINCT keyword specifies that only unique values are returned in the result set.
- The SELECT statement selects the customer_id and name from the customer table and calculates the total_spent by using the SUM function on the total_price column in the order table.
- The INNER JOIN clause joins the customer and order tables on the customer_id column.
- The INNER JOIN clause also joins the order and product tables on the product_id column.
- The WHERE clause specifies the condition that the product must belong to the 'Electronics' category.
- The GROUP BY clause groups the data by customer_id.
- The HAVING clause specifies that the total_spent must be greater than 1000.
- The ORDER BY clause arranges the result set in descending order by the total_spent column.
