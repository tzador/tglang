-- This is a complex SQL query to retrieve customer data, their purchases and total cost

SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.first_name, customers.last_name, orders.order_id, products.product_name, order_details.quantity, products.price, SUM(products.price * order_details.quantity) AS total_cost
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
INNER JOIN order_details ON orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
INNER JOIN products ON order_details.product_id = products.product_id
GROUP BY customers.customer_id, orders.order_id, products.product_name
ORDER BY customers.customer_id, orders.order_id;

/* This SELECT statement retrieves the customer's unique ID, first and last name, along with their order ID.
It also includes the product name and quantity purchased from each order, along with the price of each product.
The "total_cost" column calculates the sum of each product's price multiplied by its quantity for each order.
The INNER JOINs ensure that the data is retrieved from all four tables, linking the customer, order, and product data together.
The GROUP BY clause ensures that the data is grouped together by customer ID, order ID, and product name.
Finally, the results are sorted by customer ID and order ID in ascending order.
