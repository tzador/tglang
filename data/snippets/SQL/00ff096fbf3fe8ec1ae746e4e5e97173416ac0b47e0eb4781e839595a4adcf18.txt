-- This code snippet uses a UNION operator to combine the results of two SELECT queries.

CREATE TABLE employees(
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES(1, 'John', 'Marketing', 5000);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES(2, 'Mary', 'Sales', 6000);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES(3, 'Bob', 'Human Resources', 4000);

-- Select the names of employees in the Marketing department
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing'

UNION

-- Select the names of employees who earn more than 5500
SELECT name
