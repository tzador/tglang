-- This is a complex SQL query that uses a combination of different clauses and functions to retrieve data from multiple tables and perform aggregations and filtering
SELECT
    c.customer_id, -- Selecting the customer ID
    c.customer_name, -- Selecting the customer name
    SUM(o.order_total) as total_spent, -- Using the SUM function to calculate the total amount spent by each customer
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as num_orders, -- Using the COUNT function with the DISTINCT keyword to count the number of unique orders made by each customer
    o.order_date, -- Selecting the order date
    CASE -- Using a CASE statement to assign a label to each customer based on their total spending
        WHEN SUM(o.order_total) >= 1000 THEN 'High spender'
        WHEN SUM(o.order_total) >= 500 THEN 'Medium spender'
        ELSE 'Low spender'
    END as spending_label
FROM customers c -- Specifying the customers table
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id -- Joining the orders table based on the customer ID
WHERE 
    c.customer_country = 'USA' -- Filtering the results to only include customers from the USA
    AND o.order_date < '2020-01-01' -- Filter the results to only include orders made before January 1, 2020
GROUP BY c.customer_id -- Grouping the results by customer ID
ORDER BY num_orders DESC -- Ordering the results by the number of orders in descending order
LIMIT 10 -- Limiting the number of results to only 10
; -- End of the query
