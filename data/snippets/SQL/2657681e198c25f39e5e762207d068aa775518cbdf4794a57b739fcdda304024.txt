-- This is a SQL query to find the average order value for each customer in the customers table
-- First, we need to join the orders and customers tables on the customer_id field
SELECT AVG(order_value) AS average_order_value -- This is the alias for the calculated average order value
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers 
ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
GROUP BY customers.customer_id -- Group the results by customer_id to get the average for each customer
ORDER BY average_order_value DESC; -- Order the results in descending order of average order value
