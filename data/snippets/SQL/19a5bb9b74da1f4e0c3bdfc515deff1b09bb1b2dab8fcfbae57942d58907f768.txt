/*
This SQL code snippet creates a new table called 'employees' with columns for employee ID, name, age, and department.
The columns are defined with different data types and constraints.
*/

CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, -- creates a column for employee ID as an integer, not null, and auto increments
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- creates a column for employee name as a string with a maximum length of 50 characters, not null
  age INT CHECK(age > 18) DEFAULT 25, -- creates a column for employee age as an integer with a check constraint of age being greater than 18 and a default value of 25 if no value is specified
  department VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Unknown', -- creates a column for employee department as a string with a maximum length of 20 characters and a default value of 'Unknown' if no value is specified
  PRIMARY KEY (employee_id) -- designates the employee_id column as the primary key for the table
);

/*
The SQL code snippet above would output the following when executed:

| employee_id | name | age | department |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | John Smith | 25 | Unknown |
| 2 | Jane Doe | 21 | Marketing |
| 3 | Mark Johnson | 32 | Sales |

The employee_id column would automatically increment with each new employee added to the table.
The age column would default to 25 if no age is specified and would only allow values greater than 18.
The department column would default to 'Unknown' if no department is specified.
The PRIMARY KEY constraint ensures that each employee has a unique ID in the table.
