-- This is a complex SQL query that retrieves data from two tables and applies multiple filters and joins.

SELECT p.product_name, c.customer_name, COUNT(s.sale_id) AS total_sales
FROM products p
INNER JOIN sales s ON s.product_id = p.product_id
INNER JOIN customers c ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE p.product_price > 50 AND c.country = 'USA' AND s.date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-03-31'
GROUP BY p.product_name, c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
