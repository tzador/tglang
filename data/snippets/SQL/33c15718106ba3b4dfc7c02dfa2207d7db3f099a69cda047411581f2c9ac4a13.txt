-- This SQL query selects the total revenue for each product in the past 12 months, 
-- sorted by highest revenue to lowest.

-- First, create a temporary table to store the product names and their total revenue.

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE product_revenue (
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    total_revenue DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Then, populate the temporary table by getting the product names and their total revenue 
-- from the sales table, filtering by the past 12 months.

INSERT INTO product_revenue
SELECT product_name, SUM(total_price)
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN DATEADD(MONTH, -12, GETDATE()) AND GETDATE()
GROUP BY product_name;

-- Finally, retrieve the data from the temporary table and order it by the total revenue 
-- in descending order.

SELECT product_name, total_revenue
FROM product_revenue
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
