--This code snippet demonstrates a complex SQL query that involves multiple tables and joins.

SELECT c.name AS customer_name, SUM(o.total_price) AS total_spent, COUNT(o.id) AS num_orders --Selecting the customer name, total amount spent, and number of orders placed
FROM customers c --Choosing the customers table as the primary table
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id --Joining the customers table with the orders table on the customer_id column
INNER JOIN order_details od ON o.id = od.order_id --Joining the orders table with the order_details table on the order_id column
INNER JOIN products p ON p.id = od.product_id --Joining the order_details table with the products table on the product_id column
WHERE p.category = 'Electronics' --Filtering the products by category to only include electronics
GROUP BY c.name --Grouping the results by customer name
HAVING COUNT(o.id) >= 3 --Only including customers who have placed at least 3 orders
ORDER BY total_spent DESC --Ordering the results by total amount spent in descending order
LIMIT 10; --Limiting the results to only the top 10 customers
