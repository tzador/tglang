-- This example is a complex query that joins data from multiple tables and applies various conditions and calculations
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(o.order_quantity) AS total_quantity, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders -- select product name, total quantity and total orders
FROM products p -- from products table
JOIN orders o -- join with orders table 
ON p.product_id = o.product_id -- matching product ids
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' -- only orders between specified dates
GROUP BY p.product_name -- group by product name
HAVING SUM(o.order_quantity) > 1000 -- having a total quantity greater than 1000
ORDER BY total_orders DESC -- order results by total orders in descending order
