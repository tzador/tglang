-- Selects all columns from the "customers" table 
SELECT * FROM customers;
-- Joins the "customers" table with the "orders" table and 
-- retrieves columns from both tables: 
SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_date, orders.total_price 
FROM customers 
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
-- Filters the results to only show customers who have 
-- placed an order in the last 3 months:
WHERE orders.order_date BETWEEN DATEADD(month, -3, GETDATE()) AND GETDATE()
-- Orders the results by the customer's total order amount 
-- in descending order:
ORDER BY orders.total_price DESC;
