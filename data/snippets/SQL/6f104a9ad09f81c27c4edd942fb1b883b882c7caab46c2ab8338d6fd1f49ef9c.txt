-- This code snippet demonstrates a complex SQL query that selects data from multiple tables
SELECT [column1], [column2], [column3] -- Selects three columns from the table
FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 -- Joins the two tables together based on a matching column
ON table1.[matching_column] = table2.[matching_column] -- Specifies the columns used for the join
LEFT JOIN table3 -- Performs a left join with a third table
ON table1.[column1] = table3.[column1] -- Specifies the columns used for the join
WHERE table2.[column2] IN (SELECT [column2] FROM table4 WHERE [condition]) -- Uses a subquery to filter data from table2
AND table1.[column3] NOT IN (SELECT [column3] FROM table5 WHERE [condition]) -- Uses another subquery to filter data from table1
ORDER BY table1.[column1], table3.[column2] DESC -- Orders the result set by two columns, one ascending and one descending
