-- This code snippet creates a stored procedure that calculates the total salary for each department in a company
--

-- Define the table structure for the company salaries
CREATE TABLE salaries (
  emp_id INT,
  emp_name VARCHAR(50),
  department VARCHAR(50),
  salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Define the stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE calculate_total_salaries()
BEGIN
  -- Declare variables to hold department names and total salary for each department
  DECLARE dept_name VARCHAR(50);
  DECLARE total_salary DECIMAL(10,2);

  -- Create a cursor to loop through all distinct departments in the salaries table
  DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR SELECT DISTINCT department FROM salaries;

  -- Open the cursor to start the loop
  OPEN cur;

  -- Start the loop and fetch the first department name
  FETCH cur INTO dept_name;

  -- Loop until there are no more departments to iterate through
  WHILE (dept_name IS NOT NULL) DO
    -- Calculate the total salary for the current department
    SELECT SUM(salary) INTO total_salary
    FROM salaries
    WHERE department = dept_name;

    -- Insert the calculated total salary into a new table called department_salaries
    INSERT INTO department_salaries (department, total_salary)
    VALUES (dept_name, total_salary);

    -- Fetch the next department name
    FETCH cur INTO dept_name;
  END WHILE;

  -- Close the cursor to end the loop
  CLOSE cur;
END;

-- Call the stored procedure to execute it
CALL calculate_total_salaries();
