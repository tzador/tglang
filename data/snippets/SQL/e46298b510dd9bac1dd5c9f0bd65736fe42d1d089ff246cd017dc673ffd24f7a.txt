-- This is a complex SQL query that joins multiple tables and includes subqueries and conditional statements.

SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM customers AS c
INNER JOIN persons AS p
ON c.person_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN orders AS o
ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE p.age >= 18
GROUP BY p.first_name, p.last_name
HAVING total_orders > 10
ORDER BY p.last_name DESC;

-- Explanation:
-- This query selects the first name and last name from a customers table and counts the total number of unique orders made by each customer. It uses an inner join to connect the customers table to a persons table on a common ID, and a left join to connect the customers table to an orders table on a common customer ID. 
-- The WHERE clause filters the results to only include persons who are 18 years or older. The results are then grouped by first and last name and the results are further narrowed down using the HAVING clause to only include persons with more than 10 orders. Finally, the results are sorted in descending order by last name.
