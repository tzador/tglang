--First, create a temporary table to store customer names and their IDs
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_customers (customer_id int, customer_name varchar(255));

--Next, insert data into this temporary table by joining the customers and orders tables
INSERT INTO temp_customers

--Then, select all data from the temporary table and join it with the orders table to get the corresponding orders for each customer
