CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ComplexView AS (
    SELECT col1, col2, col3
    FROM table1 t1
    JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
    WHERE col3 <> 'Some condition'
    GROUP BY col1
    HAVING COUNT(col2) > 0
    UNION
    SELECT col1, col2, col3
    FROM table3 t3
    LEFT JOIN table4 t4 ON t3.name = t4.name
    WHERE col3 = 'Some value'
    GROUP BY col1
    HAVING COUNT(col2) > 0
    ORDER BY col1 DESC, col2 ASC
