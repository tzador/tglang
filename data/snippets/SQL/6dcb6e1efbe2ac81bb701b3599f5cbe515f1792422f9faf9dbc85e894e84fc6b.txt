-- This is a complex SQL query that joins multiple tables and uses subqueries and aggregate functions to retrieve data.
-- It calculates the average salary for each department in a company, along with the total number of employees and the highest paid employee in each department.

SELECT 
    d.name AS department, -- Select the department name from the department table.
    AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary, -- Calculate the average salary for all employees in that department.
    COUNT(e.emp_id) AS num_employees, -- Count the total number of employees in the department.
    (SELECT emp_name FROM employees WHERE emp_id = (SELECT MAX(emp_id) FROM employees WHERE department_id = d.id)) AS highest_paid -- Use a subquery to get the name of the employee with the highest salary in the department.
FROM departments d
JOIN employees e ON d.id = e.department_id -- Join the employees table to the departments table on the department_id column.
GROUP BY d.name -- Group the results by department name.
ORDER BY d.name ASC; -- Sort the results alphabetically by department name.
