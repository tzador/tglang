/* This query retrieves the shipping information for orders that have been placed in the past 30 days.
The query first selects the order ID, customer ID, and order date from the orders table.
Then, it joins the customers table on customer ID to retrieve the customer's first and last name and email.
Next, it joins the order_items table on order ID to retrieve the product name and quantity for each item in the order.
The final query filters for orders that have been placed within the past 30 days and sorts them by order date in descending order. */
