-- This is a complex SQL query that joins multiple tables, uses subqueries and aggregates data

SELECT t1.id, t1.name, COUNT(t2.id)
FROM table1 AS t1
INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.table1_id
WHERE t1.name IN (SELECT name FROM table3 WHERE id IN (SELECT table1_id FROM table4 WHERE column = 'value'))
GROUP BY t1.id, t1.name
HAVING COUNT(t2.id) > 10
ORDER BY t1.name DESC;
