-- This is a complex SQL query that joins multiple tables 
-- and uses aggregate functions and grouping to calculate sales data 

SELECT
    p.product_name,                  -- Select the product name from the products table
    SUM(s.quantity) AS total_qty,    -- Calculate the sum of the quantity sold from the sales table
    AVG(s.unit_price) AS avg_price,  -- Calculate the average unit price from the sales table
    SUM(s.quantity * s.unit_price) as total_sales  -- Calculate the total sales by multiplying quantity and unit price
FROM products p                     -- From the products table
INNER JOIN sales s                  -- Join with the sales table
    ON p.product_id = s.product_id  -- Matching on product id
WHERE s.sale_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-01-31' -- Filter by sale date between Jan 1, 2021 and Jan 31, 2021
GROUP BY p.product_name             -- Group by product name
HAVING SUM(s.quantity) > 100        -- Only show results where the sum of quantity is greater than 100
ORDER BY total_sales DESC           -- Order the results by total sales in descending order 
LIMIT 10                            -- Limit the results to the top 10 products
