-- This is a complex SQL query that performs multiple calculations and joins multiple tables.

-- This query calculates the average order total for each customer, as well as their average order quantity and average unit price.

SELECT
    customers.customer_name,
    AVG(orders.order_total) AS avg_order_total,
    AVG(order_items.quantity) AS avg_order_quantity,
    AVG(order_items.unit_price) AS avg_unit_price
FROM
    customers
INNER JOIN
    orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
INNER JOIN
    order_items ON orders.order_id = order_items.order_id
GROUP BY
    customers.customer_name

-- This query then filters the results by only showing customers with an average order total greater than $500.

HAVING avg_order_total > 500

-- The results are sorted in descending order by their average order total.

ORDER BY avg_order_total DESC
