/* 
 This query creates a `customers` table with columns `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, and `address`. 
 The `id` column is set as the primary key and will automatically increment with each new customer added. 
 The `email` column is set as a `NOT NULL` constraint, meaning it must have a value entered for each customer. 
The `phone` and `address` columns are optional and can be left blank.
