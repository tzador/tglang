-- This is a complex SQL query that joins two tables and uses multiple aggregate functions
-- to calculate the total revenue for each product in the 'sales' table
SELECT
    product.product_name, -- Selecting the product name from the 'product' table
    SUM(sales.quantity_sold) AS total_quantity, -- Calculating the total quantity sold for each product
    SUM(sales.quantity_sold * sales.unit_price) AS total_revenue, -- Calculating the total revenue for each product
    AVG(sales.unit_price) AS average_price, -- Calculating the average price of each product
    MAX(sales.unit_price) AS highest_price, -- Finding the highest price for each product
    MIN(sales.unit_price) AS lowest_price -- Finding the lowest price for each product
FROM sales 
INNER JOIN product ON sales.product_id = product.id -- Joining the 'sales' table with the 'product' table on matching product IDs
GROUP BY product.product_name -- Grouping the results by product name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC -- Ordering the results by total revenue in descending order
