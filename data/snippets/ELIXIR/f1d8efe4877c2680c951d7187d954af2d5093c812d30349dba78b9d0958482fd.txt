# This function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers

def gcd(a, b) when a == 0 or b == 0 do
  # base case, one number is 0, the GCD is the other number
  max(a, b)
end

def gcd(a, b) do
  # recursive case, subtract smallest number from largest number and recursively call gcd
  gcd(rem(max(a, b), min(a, b)), min(a, b))
end

# Example: calculate GCD of 15 and 12
gcd(15, 12)

# Output:
# 3
