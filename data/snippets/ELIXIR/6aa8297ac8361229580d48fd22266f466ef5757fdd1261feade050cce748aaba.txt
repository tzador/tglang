# Function to calculate the mean of a dataset

def mean(data) do
  # Calculate the sum of all the elements in the dataset
  sum = Enum.reduce(data, fn(x, acc) -> x + acc end)

  # Calculate the length of the dataset
  data_length = length(data)

  # Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the length
  mean = sum / data_length

  # Return the mean value
  return mean
end

# Example usage of the mean function
dataset = [2, 4, 6, 8]
mean(dataset) # Output: 5.0 (the mean of the dataset)
