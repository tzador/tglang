## This code snippet is an example of a recursive function that finds the factorial of a given number

defmodule Factorial do
  # Define a function to calculate the factorial
  def find_factorial(n) do
    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1
    if n == 0 || n == 1 do
      # Return 1
      1
    # Recursive case: if n is greater than 1, call the function again with n-1 and multiply it with n
    else
      # Return the result of calling the function recursively with n-1 and multiplying it with n
      find_factorial(n-1) * n
    end
  end
end

# Call the function with a given number and print the result
IO.puts "Factorial of 5 is #{Factorial.find_factorial(5)}"

# Output:
# Factorial of 5 is 120
