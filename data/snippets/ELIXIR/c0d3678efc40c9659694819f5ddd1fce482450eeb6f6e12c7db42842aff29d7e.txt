# This function uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number

defmodule Math do
  # Function that takes in a number and returns its factorial
  def factorial(n) do
    # Base case: if n = 0 or 1, return 1
    if n == 0 || n == 1 do
      1
    else
      # Recursive call: multiply n by the factorial of n-1 and continue until n = 1 or 0
      n * factorial(n-1)
    end
  end
end

# Example usage: calculating factorial of 5
Math.factorial(5)
# Output: 120
