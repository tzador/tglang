# This is a module that calculates the average value of a list of numbers.

defmodule Average do

  # This function takes in a list of numbers and calculates their average value.
  # Param:
  # - list: a list of numbers
  # Output:
  # - average: the average value of the input list

  def calculate_average(list) do
    sum = 0 # initialize sum to 0

    # loop through the list and add each number to the sum
    for number <- list, do: sum = sum + number

    # calculate the length of the list and cast it to a float
    list_length = list |> length |> Float.round

    # calculate the average by dividing the sum by the list length
    average = sum / list_length

    # return the average value
    average

# sample input list
list = [1, 5, 10, 3]

# print the result
