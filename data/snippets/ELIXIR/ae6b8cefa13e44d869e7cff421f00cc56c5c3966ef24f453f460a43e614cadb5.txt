#This code snippet takes a list of integers and returns a new list with only even numbers
defmodule EvenNumbers do
  #Function to filter for even numbers
  def filter_even(numbers) do
    #Using Enum.filter to iterate through the list and filter the even numbers
    Enum.filter(numbers, fn(number) -> rem(number,2) == 0 end)
  end
end

#Example usage
EvenNumbers.filter_even([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]) #Output: [2,4,6,8]
