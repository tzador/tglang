# This is a list comprehension code snippet in Elixir
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "strawberry"]

# We are creating a new list that contains the length of each string in the original list
list_lengths = for item <- my_list, do: String.length(item)

# Here, we are filtering the new list to only contain items with a length greater than 5
filtered_list = for item <- list_lengths, item > 5

# Lastly, we are mapping the filtered list to a new list that contains the square of each item
final_list = for item <- filtered_list, do: item * item

# Output:
# final_list => [36, 49, 64]
