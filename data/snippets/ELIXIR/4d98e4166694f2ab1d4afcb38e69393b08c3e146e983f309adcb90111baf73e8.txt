# This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
# Input: num - an integer value
# Output: factorial - the calculated factorial of the input num
def factorial(num) do
  factorial = 1 # initialize the factorial variable to 1
  for i <- 1..num do # loop through numbers from 1 to num
    factorial = factorial * i # multiply the factorial variable by the current number in the loop
  end
  factorial # return the calculated factorial value
