"""
  This function checks if the given number is present in the list or not.
  It starts by initializing a boolean value to false, indicating that the number
  has not been found yet. Then it loops through each element in the list and
  compares it with the given number. If a match is found, the boolean value is
  set to true and loop is broken, returning the value. Otherwise, the loop
  continues till the end of the list and the initial boolean value is returned,
  indicating that the number is not present in the list.
