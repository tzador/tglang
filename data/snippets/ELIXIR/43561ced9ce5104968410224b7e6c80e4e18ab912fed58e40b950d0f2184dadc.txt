# This code snippet is a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

defmodule Factorial do
  # Defining the function 'factorial' which takes in one parameter, 'n'
  # This function will calculate the factorial of 'n' using recursion
  def factorial(n) do
    # Base case: If 'n' is equal to zero, the factorial is 1
    if n == 0 do
      # Returning 1
      1
    # Recursive case: If 'n' is not equal to zero, computing the factorial
    else
      # Multiplying 'n' by the factorial of 'n - 1'
      n * factorial(n - 1)
    end
  end
end

# Example usage:
Factorial.factorial(5)
# Output:
# 120
