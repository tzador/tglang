  # This module contains functions for basic arithmetic operations
  
  # Function to calculate the sum of two numbers

# Example usage of the Calculator module
# Calculates the sum of 5 and 3 and prints the result
IO.puts(Calculator.sum(5, 3))

# Calculates the product of 6 and 4 and prints the result
IO.puts(Calculator.product(6, 4))
