# This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the average
def average(numbers) do
  sum = 0
  length = length(numbers)

  # This loop computes the sum of all the numbers in the list
  for i <- numbers, do: sum = sum + i

  # This returns the average by dividing the sum with the length of the list
  sum / length
end

# Example call of the function
