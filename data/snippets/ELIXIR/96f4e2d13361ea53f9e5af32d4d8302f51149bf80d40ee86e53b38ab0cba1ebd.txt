#This code snippet shows a function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

defmodule Factorial do
  #This function takes in a number as an argument and returns its factorial
  #Example: factorial(5) will return 120

  def factorial(n) do
    #If the number is 0 or 1, its factorial will be 1
    if n == 0 || n == 1 do
      1
    #If the number is greater than 1, the factorial will be calculated using recursion
    else
      #Call the factorial function on the number one less than the current number and multiply it by the current number
      factorial(n - 1) * n
    end
  end
end

#To use this function, simply call it with the desired number as an argument
Factorial.factorial(5)

#Output: 120
