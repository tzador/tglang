### IO
# Creates a new IO stream on the given device
Stream.resource(
  fn ->
    # opens a file for reading
    {:ok, file} = File.open("data.txt")
    # returns the file as a device to be used for reading input
    file
  end,
  # defines the function to read from the device
  fn device ->
    # if there is any data left to read, return the data and the new device
    case IO.read(device, :line) do
      {:ok, data} -> {:cont, data, device}
      # if there is no more data to read, close the device and return :done
      :eof -> {:halt, :done}
    end
  end,
  # the function to be called upon completion of the stream
