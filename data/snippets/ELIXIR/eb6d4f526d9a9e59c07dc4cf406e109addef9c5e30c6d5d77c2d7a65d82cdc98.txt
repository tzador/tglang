# Define a module named product
defmodule Product do
  # Define a variable named price and assign it a value
  price = 50

  # Define a function that will calculate the total cost of a product based on quantity
  def calculate_cost(quantity) do
    # Calculate the total cost by multiplying quantity with price variable
    total_cost = quantity * price

    # Print the total cost to the console
    IO.puts("The total cost is #{total_cost}")

    # Return the total cost
    total_cost

  end
end

# Call the calculate_cost function with quantity of 3
Product.calculate_cost(3)

# Output:
# The total cost is 150

# Call the update_price function with a new price of 75
Product.update_price(75)

# Output:
# The price has been updated to 75

# Call the calculate_cost function again with the new price and a quantity of 5
Product.calculate_cost(5)

# Output:
# The total cost is 375
