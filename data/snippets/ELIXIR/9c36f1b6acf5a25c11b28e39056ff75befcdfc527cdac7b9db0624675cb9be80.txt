# Function to calculate the factorial of a given number
defmodule Factorial do
  # Define 'fact' function which takes in one argument 'n'
  # In Elixir, a function name is followed by the number of arguments it takes
  # In this case, our function takes in only one argument 'n'
  def fact(n) do
    # If the argument n is 0, then return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
    if n == 0 do
      return 1
    # Else if the argument n is 1, then return 1 as the factorial of 1 is also 1
    else if n == 1 do
      return 1
    # Else, recursively call the 'fact' function and multiply it with n
    else
      n * fact(n-1)
    end

# Call the 'fact' function with a given number
Factorial.fact(5)

# Expected Output: 120
