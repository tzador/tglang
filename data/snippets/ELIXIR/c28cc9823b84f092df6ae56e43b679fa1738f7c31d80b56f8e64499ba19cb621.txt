#Define a module with a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
defmodule Factorial do
    #Function to calculate the factorial
    def calculate(n) do
        #Check if the number is 0, if so, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
        if n == 0 do
            1
        #Check if the number is 1, if so, return 1 as the factorial of 1 is 1
        elsif n == 1 do
            1
        #If the number is greater than 1, use recursion to calculate the factorial
        else
            #Call the calculate function with n-1 and multiply it with n
            #This will continue until n reaches 1 and the factorial is calculated
            calculate(n-1) * n
        end
    end
end

#Call the function with a number
Factorial.calculate(5) #=> 120
