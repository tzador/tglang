# Definition of a function named "sum" that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list
def sum(list) do
  # Initialize a variable named "total" to 0, this will keep track of the running sum
  total = 0

  # Loop through the list of numbers using the "Enum.each" method, this method takes in two arguments - the list and a function to be applied on each element
  Enum.each(list, fn number ->
    # Add the current number to the "total" variable
    total = total + number
  end)

  # Return the final "total" value
  total
end

# Call the "sum" function and pass in a list of numbers
sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) #=> 15

# Output:
def sum(list) do
  total = 0
  Enum.each(list, fn number ->
    total = total + number
  end)
  total
end
sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) #=> 15
