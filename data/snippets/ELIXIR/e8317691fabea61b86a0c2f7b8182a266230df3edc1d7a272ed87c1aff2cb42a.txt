#This code snippet uses recursion to calculate the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence.
#It takes in a single argument n, which represents the position in the sequence.

defmodule Fibonacci do
    #Define a function that takes in n as an argument.
    def nth_term(n) do
        #Base case for n = 0.
        if n == 0 do
            0
        #Base case for n = 1.
        else if n == 1 do
            1
        #Recursive case - calls the function again with n-1 and n-2 as arguments.
        else
            #Variable a represents the (n-1)th term.
            a = nth_term(n-1)
            #Variable b represents the (n-2)th term.
            b = nth_term(n-2)
            #Returns the sum of a and b as the nth term.
