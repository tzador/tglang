# This code snippet calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list using recursion

# define a function that takes in a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers
defmodule Calculate do
  def sum_even(list) do
    # check base cases
    case list do
      # if list is empty, return 0
      [] -> 0
      # if list contains only one element and it is odd, return 0
      [elem] when rem(elem, 2) == 1 -> 0
      # if list contains only one element and it is even, return that element
      [elem] -> elem
      # for larger lists, recursively call the function to get the sum of even numbers in the tail and add it to the head if it is even
      [head | tail] -> if rem(head, 2) == 0, do: head + sum_even(tail), else: sum_even(tail)
    end
  end
end

# example list
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# call the function and print the result
IO.puts Calculate.sum_even(list)

# Output: 30 (since 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30)
