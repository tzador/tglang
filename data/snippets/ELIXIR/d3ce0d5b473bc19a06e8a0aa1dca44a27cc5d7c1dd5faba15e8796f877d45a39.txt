# Define a module named 'MathFunctions'
defmodule MathFunctions do

    # Define a function named 'factorial' which takes in one argument 'n'
    def factorial(n) do

        # Create a variable 'result' and initialize it to 1
        result = 1

        # Use a 'for' loop to iterate through the values from 1 to n
        for i <- 1..n do

            # Multiply the current value of 'result' by 'i' and update 'result'
            result = result * i
        end

        # Return the calculated factorial value
        result
    end
end

# Call the 'factorial' function and pass in the argument 5
MathFunctions.factorial(5)

# Output: 120 (the factorial of 5)
