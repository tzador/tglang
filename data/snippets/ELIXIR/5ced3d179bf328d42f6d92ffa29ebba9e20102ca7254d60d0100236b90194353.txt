# This code creates a function called "factorial" with one parameter, "n", that calculates the factorial of the given number.
# Below, we use recursion to solve it, starting with the base case of n = 0 which returns 1.
# The function then calls itself with n - 1, until it reaches the base case.
# The calculated factorial is then multiplied with the current value of n and returned.
def factorial(n) do
  # Base case
  if n == 0 do
    1
  else
    # Recursive call
    n * factorial(n - 1)
  end
end

# Calling the function with the value 5, which should return 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
factorial(5)
