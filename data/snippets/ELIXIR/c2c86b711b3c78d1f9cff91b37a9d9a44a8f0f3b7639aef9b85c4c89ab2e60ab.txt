# This function calculates the fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.
# It uses recursion to continuously call itself until the base case of n = 0 or n = 1 is reached.
# The _ represents a wildcard variable which can be any value.
# The recursive calls add the values of the previous two terms to generate the next term in the sequence.
# The function returns the nth term in the fibonacci sequence.
