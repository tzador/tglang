## Define a module named Math
defmodule Math do
  ## Define a function named power that takes in two parameters, base and exponent
  def power(base, exponent) do
    ## Check if base is equal to 0
    if base == 0 do
      ## If base is 0, return 0
      0
    ## If base is not equal to 0
    else
      ## Use the built-in function pow to calculate base raised to the exponent power
      :math.pow(base, exponent)
    end
  end
end

## Define a variable named num and assign it a value of 5
num = 5

## Call the power function from the Math module passing in num to the base and 2 to the exponent
Math.power(num, 2)

## The output will be 25, as 5^2 is equal to 25
