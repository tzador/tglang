#This code snippet is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number

defmodule Factorial do
  #The `factorial` function takes in a number and returns its factorial value
  #It uses pattern matching to handle the base case of 0 and the recursive case for other numbers
  def factorial(0), do: 1
  def factorial(n), do: n * factorial(n - 1)
end

#Example: calculating the factorial of 5
Factorial.factorial(5) #returns 120
