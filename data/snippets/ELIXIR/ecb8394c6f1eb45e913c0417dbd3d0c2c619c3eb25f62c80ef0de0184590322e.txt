# Function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
# Returns a list of the sequence
def fibonacci(n) do
  # Create an accumulator to store the calculated numbers
  acc = [0, 1]
  
  # Use a for loop to iterate from index 2 to n
  for i <- 2..n do
    # Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
    next = List.last(acc) + List.last(List.delete_at(acc, i-1))
    
    # Append the next number to the accumulator
    acc = acc ++ [next]
  end
  
  # Return the final accumulator as the Fibonacci sequence
  acc
end

# Example of calling the fibonacci function with an input
fibonacci(10) #=> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
