# This is an Elixir program that defines a module, a struct, 
# and a function that utilizes pattern matching.

defmodule User do
  # Defining a struct with attributes
  defstruct name: "John", age: 20, occupation: "Developer"

  # Function that takes in a user struct
  def print_user_info(%User{name: name, age: age, occupation: occupation}) do
    IO.puts "#{name} is #{age} years old and works as a #{occupation}."
  end
end

# Creating an instance of the User struct
user = %User{name: "Jane", age: 25, occupation: "Designer"}

# Calling the print_user_info function with the user struct as argument
User.print_user_info(user)

# Output:
# Jane is 25 years old and works as a Designer.
