func fibonacci{ # function declaration
[a, b: int] # specifying inputs as integer variables
-> [result: int] # specifies that the output will be an integer called "result"

  locals # specifies local variables used in the function
  [i, temp: int] # defines two local variables, both are of type integer

  i = 1 # assigns value 1 to local variable i
  temp = 0 # assigns value 0 to local variable temp

  while i <= a do # while loop to perform Fibonacci calculation
  # do the following until condition i <= a is met
    result = a + b # calculates Fibonacci number
    b = a # assigns current value of a to b
    a = result # assigns current value of result to a
    i = i + 1 # increments i by 1
  endwhile

} # end of function definition

# calling the function with input values
fibonacci{5, 8} # returns 13 as the 5th Fibonacci number is 5 and the 6th is 8, so 13 is the next in the sequence
