\ This is a code snippet in FIFT programming language
\ It uses the built-in map function to multiply each element in a list by 2
: multiply_list ( li -- li' )
  \ duplicate the list
  DUP 
  \ create an empty accumulator stack
  0 
  \ define a function that multiplies each element by 2
  [
    \ get the next element in the list
    1 pick 
    \ multiply by 2
    2 * 
    \ push the result onto the accumulator stack
    2 over 
    s,\ s
  ] map
  \ discard the original list
