;;; This is a complex and long code snippet written in FIFT

;;; Declaring a new variable 'num' and initializing it with a value of 5
defvar num
mov num, 5

;;; Creating a new empty stack
drop

;;; Pushing the value of 'num' onto the stack
psh num

;;; Performing operations on the stack
mov a, pop
mov b, pop
add a, b
mul a, 2
div a, 5

;;; Printing the final result
.<div class="result">The final result is: a</div>

;;; Defining a function 'factorial' to calculate the factorial of a number
defun factorial
psh 1
psh 1
mov a, pop
add a, 1

;;; Looping through all numbers from 1 to the value of 'num'
;;; and multiplying them with the previous result on the stack
label loop
psh a
mov b, pop
mul a, b
dec b
psh b
jz loop

;;; Return the final result on the stack
ret
endfun

;;; Calling the 'factorial' function with the value of 'num'
psh num
call factorial

;;; Printing the factorial of 'num'
.<div class="result">The factorial of num is: a</div>

;;; Setting a conditional statement to check if 'num' is greater than 10
mov a, num
gt a, 10
ifeq greater_than_10
.<div class="result">Num is greater than 10!</div>
ifeq end

;;; Ends the program if 'num' is not greater than 10
end

;;; End of code snippet
