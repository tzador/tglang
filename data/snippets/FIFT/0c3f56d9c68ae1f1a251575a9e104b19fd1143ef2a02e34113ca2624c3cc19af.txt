;;; Example FIFT Code

;;; Defining variables
let x = 5 ;; sets value of x to 5
let y = 10 ;; sets value of y to 10

;;; Defining functions
{ 
  x y + ;; adds values of x and y
  dup ;; duplicates the result
  over ;; duplicates the top element of the stack
  swap ;; swaps the top two elements of the stack
  * ;; multiplies the top two elements of the stack
  2 / ;; divides the top element by 2
  over ;; duplicates the top element of the stack
  swap ;; swaps the top two elements of the stack
  3 min ;; gets the minimum of the top two elements
  swap ;; swaps the top two elements of the stack
  2 + ;; adds 2 to the top element
  4 > ;; checks if the top element is greater than 4
  if {@ "x is greater than 4."} {@ "x is less than or equal to 4."} ?? ;; conditional statement that prints the appropriate message

  swap ;; swaps the top two elements of the stack
  drop ;; drops the top element from the stack
} calc ;; names this function as calc

;;; Calling the function
calc ;; calls the calc function, which will print either "x is greater than 4." or "x is less than or equal to 4." depending on the value of x
