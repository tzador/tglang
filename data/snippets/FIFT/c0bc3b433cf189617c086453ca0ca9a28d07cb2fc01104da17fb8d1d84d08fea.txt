\ This is a sample code snippet in Fift
\\ This code will generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

PROCEDURE fib(n) {
    INTEGER a, b, c;
    a = 0;
    b = 1;
    WHILE n > 0 DO
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
        PRINT a; \ print the current number in sequence
        n = n - 1;
    ENDWHILE;
}

\ Call the procedure with a specific number
CALL fib(10);
