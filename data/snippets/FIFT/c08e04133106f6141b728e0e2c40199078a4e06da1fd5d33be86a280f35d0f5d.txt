--[[This is a code snippet in FIFT, a Forth-like programming language designed for the TON virtual machine. It is used to execute smart contracts on the TON blockchain.
     The following code snippet defines a function called 'factorial' which takes in an integer 'n' as a parameter and calculates the factorial value of 'n' using a loop. It then returns the factorial value as output.
     This snippet also includes a conditional statement, which checks if 'n' is equal to or less than 1, and returns 1 if true. Otherwise, it continues to iterate through the loop until 'n' is equal to 1.
     Please note that this code snippet is for demonstration purposes only and may not be fully functional.]]
     
-- Define the 'factorial' function
: factorial | n -- n!
    # Check if n is equal to or less than 1
    1 <= IF
        1 # Return 1 if true
    ELSE
        1 # Initialize a variable 'result' with value 1
        'result' := # Store 'result' in TON Virtual Machine's memory
        'n' <= # Check if n is equal to 1
    WHILE
        'result' @ # Retrieve 'result' from memory
        'n' -- # Decrement n by 1
        'result' 'n' * # Multiply 'result' with n
        'result' := # Store the updated 'result' in memory
    REPEAT
    'result' # Return the final 'result' value
