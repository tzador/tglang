;; This is a sample code snippet in FIFT, a custom programming language created by Free TON Community.
;; It generates a random number using a linear congruential generator algorithm and prints it out.

; Code snippet in FIFT to generate a random number

;; Define seed constant
CONSTANT Seed 4711

;; Define m, c and a as constants for LCG algorithm
CONSTANT m 2**32
CONSTANT c 336


;; Define function to generate random number using LCG algorithm
DEFINE-RANDOM-FUNCTION
  <( Method ( seed, m, c ) seed * m + c )>
  GET-PARAMS 3
  *ROTPARAMS MR
;

;; Define constant for number of iterations
CONSTANT Iterations 10

;; Define loop to generate multiple random numbers
ITERATE
  0
  DUP Iterations >
WHILE
  Seed tuck ITERATE-RANDOM-FUNCTION SWAP
  DUP .tout ; Prints out generated random number
  SWAP 1 + SWAP
;

;; End of code snippet. Thanks for using FIFT!
