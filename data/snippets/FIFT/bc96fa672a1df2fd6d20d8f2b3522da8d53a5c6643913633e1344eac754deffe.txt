;; This is a sample code snippet in FIFT, a Forth-based language designed for writing smart contracts on the FreeTON network.

;; Define a new variable called 'counter' and initialize it with a value of 1
1 counter !Uint ADD

;; Define a new function called 'increment' that takes the 'counter' variable as an argument and increments its value by 1
: increment
  dup counter x#0001 ADD counter +

;; Define a new function called 'multiply' that takes two arguments and multiplies them together
: multiply
  * ;

;; Define a new function called 'factorial' that calculates the factorial of a given number
: factorial
  dup 1 =
  if 1
  else dup 1 - factorial * 
  then ;

;; Calculate the factorial of 5 using the previously defined functions
5 factorial
