  \ Begin by declaring a variable of type "map" with key type "int" and value type "str"
  map int str myMap

  \ Add a few key-value pairs to the map
  myMap 1 "hello"
  myMap 2 "world"

  \ Declare a new variable to hold the sum of all map keys
  int sumKeys = 0

  \ Loop through the map keys and add them to the sum
  for int key in myMap.keys do
    sumKeys += key
  endfor

  \ Print the sum of the map keys
  %int sumKeys

  \ Output:
  \ 3
