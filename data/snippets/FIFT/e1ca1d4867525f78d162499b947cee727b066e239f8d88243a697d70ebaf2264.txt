;;; This is a code snippet for a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers
;;; in a given array.
 
sum-even:
 	{ ( -- s )                 ;;; stack: array
 	  0 swap                  ;;; initialize sum to 0
 	  { even? } filter        ;;; filter the array to only contain even numbers
 	  [ swap + ] reduce       ;;; sum up all the even numbers in the filtered array
 	   over over length swap ;;; duplicate the resulting sum and the original array
 	  .( \n Sum of ) .(: ) . ;;; print message and sum value
 	  swap .( is ) .          ;;; print message
 	  { .( \n ) .( * ) swap ( ) . } [ .(, ) ] for-each ;;; print the elements in the original array separated by '*'
 	  .( = ) .                 ;;; print message
 	  .( \n ) . ;;; print newline
