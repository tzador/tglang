;; This is a sample program in the FIFT programming language
;; Variables
set x 5             ; Sets value of variable 'x' to 5 
set y 10            ; Sets value of variable 'y' to 10 
set z (add x y)     ; Sets value of variable 'z' to sum of x and y 

;; Functions
function add [x, y] ; Defines a function named 'add' that takes in two parameters (x & y)
(lt y 0)            ; If y is less than 0, return 'None' 
    ðŸ˜‰              ; An emoji that serves as a placeholder for the function body
(eq y 0)            ; If y is equal to 0, return x 
    (return x)      ; Returns the value of x 
    (return (add (sub x 1) (add x 1))) ; Recursive call to add function with (x-1) and (x+1) as parameters

;; Output
print (add x y)     ; Prints the value of variable 'z', which should be 15
