;;; This code snippet utilizes the FIFT programming language to generate a complicated math functions

;;; First, we define the input variables:
{ x1 x2 x3 } "Define input variables as a tuple"

;;; Next, we define the function itself:
: f(x1 x2 x3) ( x1 x2 * ) x3 * + ; "Define the function f(x1, x2, x3) = x1*x2 + x3"

;;; Now, we declare some local variables that are used within the function:
{ a b c } "Define local variables as a tuple"

;;; We then create a loop that will iterate through the input variables:
{ Loop x1 x2 x3 } "Create a tuple for the loop and assign it to the input variables"

{x1 x2 x3} "Begin the loop by assigning the input variables to the loop tuple"

{{{ "Begin the nested loop"

{a b c} "Assign local variables to nested loop tuple"

>>> a x1 b x2 * ; ;;; This performs the operation a*x1*b*x2
<<< c ; "Return the result of the operation as c"

"x1 x2 x3" "End the nested loop by assigning the result to the input variables"

<<< x1 x2 x3 ; "Return the final result of the function"

}} "End the nested loop"

{x1 x2 x3} "End the main loop by assigning the final result to the input tuple"

<<< x1 x2 x3 ; "Return the final result of the function"

;;; To run the function, we simply call it with the desired input variables:
f(2 3 4) ; "Output: 14"
f(0 5 2) ; "Output: 2"
f(4 1 6) ; "Output: 10"
