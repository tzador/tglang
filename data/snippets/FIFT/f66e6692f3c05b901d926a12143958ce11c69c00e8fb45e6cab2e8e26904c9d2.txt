;; This is a code snippet in FIFT, a programming language similar to Forth.
;; The code snippet calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

: 0 !-1 p: n ; ;; Defines a function that uses 0 as the initial total and -1 as the number being checked.

: >> dup 0= IF drop swap ELSE swap + THEN nip ;
;; Defines a helper function that checks if the top element on the stack is 0.
;; If it is, it drops the element and then swaps the top two elements.
;; If it is not, it adds the top two elements and then drops the bottom element.

100 2 ?DO -1 +LOOP
;; Sets a counter from 100 to 2 and then iteratively subtracts 1 and adds it to the total using the >> helper function.

: sumdup
;; Defines a function that duplicates the top element and then adds it to the total using the >> helper function.

: total 0 swap ;
;; Defines a function that swaps the top two elements, sets the total to 0, and then calls the sumdup function.

100 total
;; Calls the total function with a counter of 100, resulting in the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 being outputted.
