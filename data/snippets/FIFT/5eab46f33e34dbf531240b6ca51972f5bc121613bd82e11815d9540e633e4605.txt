main:
FROM | fishSpikes |  //declare variable fishSpikes
LOAD !spikes         //load spikes into variable fishSpikes
INTO %spikes         //declare new variable spikes for storing values
PUSH $10             //push value 10 to top of variable stack
DUP                  //duplicate the top value on the stack
PUSH $5              //push value 5 to top of stack
SUB                  //subtract top two values on stack (will result in 5)
PICK 2               //pick the second value on the stack (5, 10 are now top two)
SWAP                 //swap top two values on stack (10, 5 are now top two)
DRTOR                //output the top value on stack as return value
 
" Explanation: This code snippet declares a variable, loads a value into it, creates a new variable, pushes two values onto the stack, subtracts them, picks and swaps values on the stack, and finally outputs the top value as the return value."
