%% This code snippet is an example of a basic FIFT program that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
%% It takes in one argument - the value of 'n'.
%% Output is the nth Fibonacci number.
 
\n %%% Define initial values for Fibonacci sequence
0 -> a
1 -> b
1 -> i

\n %%% Calculate Fibonacci number
{
    i # Dup 'i'
    1 + a # Add 'i' to 'a' and push result
    b # Push 'b'
    + # Add 'a' and 'b'
    a # Save sum as 'a'
    swap # Swap 'a' and 'b' for next loop
    1 + # Increment 'i'
    dup # Duplicate 'i' for loop condition
    < # Compare 'i' with 'n'
} while
 
\n %%% Print final result
