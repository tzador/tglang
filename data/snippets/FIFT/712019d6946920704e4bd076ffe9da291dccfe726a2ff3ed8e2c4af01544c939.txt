# This code snippet calculates the approximate value of π using the Gregory-Leibniz series.
# Define the required variables
{N}  ` Sets the number of iterations to be performed
{sum} ` Variable to store the sum of the series
{sign} ` Variable to store the alternating sign
{denominator} ` Variable to store the denominator of each term in the series
{counter} ` Variable to keep track of the current iteration

# Initialize the variables with their initial values
N 100 
sum 0.0
sign 1
denominator 1.0 
counter 0

# Start the loop to perform the series calculation N times
Loop_N:
    # Calculate the current term of the series
    {current_term} ` Denoted as δ in the Gregory-Leibniz series
    numerator 4.0 * sign ` Calculate the numerator of the current term
    current_term numerator / denominator ` Calculate the current term
    # Add the current term to the sum
    sum sum + current_term
    # Update the denominator and the sign for the next iteration
    denominator denominator + 2.0
    sign sign * -1
    # Increase the counter by one
    counter counter + 1
    # Check if the counter has reached the desired number of iterations
    counter N
        # If yes, stop the loop
        EndLoop Loop_N
    # If not, continue the loop
    Continue Loop_N

# Calculate the final value of π by multiplying the series sum by 4
{pi} ` Store the calculated value of π
pi sum * 4.0 

# Print the result
Print "The approximate value of π is: "
Print pi
