# This code snippet is written in FIFT, a programming language designed for smart contract development on the Free TON blockchain.
# It is a simple smart contract that calculates the factorial of a given number.
# The contract takes in an integer input and returns the factorial of that number.

\version 2

{  # function to calculate factorial
    : factorial    
    {  # variables initialization
        1 1 swap     # counter = 1, result = 1
    }    
    swap{  # loop 
        dup
        {  # while loop condition
            { >r r i --'  # r: counter, i: result
                r #2* - 0<

}



# This is the main smart contract code that calls the factorial function and assigns the result to a variable called 'fact'.
