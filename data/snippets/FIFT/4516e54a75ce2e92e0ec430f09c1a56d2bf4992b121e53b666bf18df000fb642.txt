-- This code snippet is a FIFT program that calculates the factorial of a given number
-- It takes in the number as input and returns the calculated factorial
-- The program uses recursion to compute the factorial

-- Function that takes in one parameter, n, and calculates the factorial recursively
: factorial ( n -- fac_n)
  dup 1 = (check if n equals 1)
  if (if condition is true)
    drop 1 (drop n and leave the result as 1)
  else (else execute the following code)
    dup 1 - (subtract 1 from n)
    factorial * (recursively call the function with n-1 and multiply it with n)
  endif (end if statement)
;

-- Main function that takes in user input and calls the factorial function
: main
  "Enter a number: " emit (asks user for input)
  s>d (converts input string to double)
  factorial (call factorial function)
  . (print the result)
;

main (call the main function to start the program)
