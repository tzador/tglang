// FIFT code for calculating the average of a list of numbers

// Declare a sum variable, to hold the total of all the numbers in the list
let sum = 0;

// Declare a count variable, to keep track of the number of numbers in the list
let count = 0;

// Declare a list of numbers, for testing purposes
let numbers = [2, 5.5, 10, 8, 1.5];

// Loop through the list of numbers
for num in numbers {

    // Add each number to the sum variable
    sum = sum + num;

    // Increase the count variable by 1
    count = count + 1;
}

// Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count
let average = sum / count;

// Print the average to the console
Console.write(`The average of the numbers in the list is: ${average}`);

/*
Expected output:
The average of the numbers in the list is: 5
