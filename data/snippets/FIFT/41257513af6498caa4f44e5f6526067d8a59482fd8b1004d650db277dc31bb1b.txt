;; Defining a function to calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
;; Takes in an integer n and returns the nth term of the sequence
(define (fibonacci n)
  ;; Base case
  (if (or (= n 0) (= n 1))
      n
      ;; Recursive call to calculate the Fibonacci number for n
      (+ (fibonacci (- n 1))
         (fibonacci (- n 2)))))

;; Example usage:
;; The 5th term of the Fibonacci sequence is 3
(fibonacci 5)
