// This snippet uses a FOR loop and conditional statements to recursively calculate the factorial of a given number.
// It first swaps the number with 1, then subtracts 1 from the top of the stack and swaps again to get the new top two elements.
// The loop continues until the stack becomes empty, at that point the final factorial value is returned.
