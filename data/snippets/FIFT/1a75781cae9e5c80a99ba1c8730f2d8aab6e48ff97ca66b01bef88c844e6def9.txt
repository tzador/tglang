>?Do_while
# This code snippet shows an example of a do-while loop in FIFT.
# The loop executes until the condition is false.

# Initialize loop counter
var i = 0

# Loop condition
do
{
  # Print current value of counter
  Print(i)

  # Increment counter by 1
  i = i + 1
}
# Check condition
while (i < 10)

# Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
