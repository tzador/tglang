# This is a complex code snippet in FIFT
//It includes operations on arrays, variables, and conditionals

// Declare an array with some values
foo = [1, 2, 3]
// Loop through the array and print each value
for value in foo:
  print(value)
  
// Assign variables based on condition
if (foo[0] == 1):
  bar = "Hello"
else
  bar = "World"
  
// Concatenate strings and print
result = bar + " " + "FIFT"
print(result)

// Define a function that takes in two parameters
func sum(x, y):
  return x + y

// Call the function and print the result
print("The sum of 5 and 10 is " + sum(5, 10))
