(define (factorial n)           ; Defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number

    1                           ; If yes, then returns 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1

(factorial 5)                   ; Calls the function to calculate the factorial of 5
                                ; Output: 120 (5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120)
