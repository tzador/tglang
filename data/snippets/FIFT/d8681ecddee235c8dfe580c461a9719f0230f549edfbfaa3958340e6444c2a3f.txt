$ 'Hello world'  // Assigns a string to the variable $ with value "Hello world"

{('Hello world', 5), ('Hi there!', 7)} ! Prints a tuple with two elements: a string and an integer
												! Output: ("Hello world", 5)
												!         ("Hi there!", 7)

^[1 1 + ]  // Pushes two integers onto the stack, adds them together, and pushes the result back onto the stack
			 ! In this case, the result is the number 2

: factorial { dup 1 > { dup 1 - => ops } { swap pop => } if }
		// Defines a factorial function that recursively multiplies a number by its previous number until it reaches 1
		// Usage: {num} factorial
		// Example: 5 factorial
		// Output: 120 (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120)
