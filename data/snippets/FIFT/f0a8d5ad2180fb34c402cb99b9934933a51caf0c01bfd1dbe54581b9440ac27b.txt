# Program to find the factorial of a number

# Define a function to calculate the factorial
def factorial(num):
# If the number is 0 or 1, return 1
if num == 0 or num == 1:
return 1

# If the number is greater than 1, use recursion
else:
# Multiply the number with the factorial of the number-1
return num * factorial(num-1)

# Take input from the user
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Call the factorial function and store the result in a variable
result = factorial(number)

# Print the result
print("The factorial of", number, "is", result)
