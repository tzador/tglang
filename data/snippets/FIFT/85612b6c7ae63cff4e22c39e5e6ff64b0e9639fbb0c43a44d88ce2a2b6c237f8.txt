/{ This is a comment in FIFT
This is a long and complex code snippet written in FIFT, a programming language used for creating smart contracts and decentralized applications. 
The following code snippet is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number. }:
: factorial { i r -- i! ( Calculates the factorial of a given number )
  dup 1 < { If i is less than 1, return 1 }
  if { Code block for base case }
    drop 1
  else { Code block for recursive case }
    dup 
    1 - { Decrements i }
    factorial { Recursive call }
    * { Multiplies the result of the recursive call with the current i }
  then
};

/{ This part is the main function that takes input from the user and calls the factorial function to calculate the factorial of the input. }:
: main { -- ( Main function )
  ." Enter a number: " { Prints a message to the user }
  ACCEPT { Takes input from the user }
