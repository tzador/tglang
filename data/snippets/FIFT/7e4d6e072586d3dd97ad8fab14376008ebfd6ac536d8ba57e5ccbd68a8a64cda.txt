# This code snippet uses the FIFT programming language
# to implement a function that calculates the sum of
# two numbers and returns the result.

| INT ADD_INTS (
    a b c d -4: a b c d | 					-- copies the four arguments to the stack
    cell+ cell+ cell+ cell+ dup add4 jumpc (a+b+c+d -4: a+b+c+d)	-- adds the four ints and jumps to the next sequence if a carry is generated
    exit							-- exits the function if no carry is generated
    1 swap+ swap upd + c move c/x			-- carries the result if the exit condition was not met and continues the addition
);

# This function takes in four 32-bit integers and adds them together,
# returning the result in the form of a single 32-bit integer.
# It works by copying the four arguments to the stack,
# then using the `add4` sequence to add the four integers together.
# If a carry is generated, the function jumps to the `exit` sequence,
# which exits the function and returns the current value of the stack.
# If no carry is generated, the function continues to the `swap` command,
# which swaps the values on the stack and adds the result to the previous sum.
# Finally, the function carries the result and repeats the process until all four
# integers have been added together and the final result is returned.
