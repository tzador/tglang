// Declare a variable `count` to store the number of iterations
count: 0;

// Create a function `add` that takes in two parameters `num1` and `num2` and returns their sum
add: [ num1 num2 -- result ] [ num1 num2 + result ];

// Create a loop that iterates 10 times and calls the `add` function with the current value of `count` and the loop index as parameters
10 [ count _ swap add count! ] times;

// Print the final value of `count`
count .
