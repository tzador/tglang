/*
This code snippet defines a function in FIFT, with annotations using semi-colons to indicate comments.
The function takes two parameters, 'x' and 'y' and checks if 'x' is greater than 'y'.
If it is, 'x' is updated and then square root is taken.
If not, 'x' is updated and square root is again taken.
Then, a loop is set up to iterate from 0 to 10 and the result of calling the function is printed using the 'format' command.
