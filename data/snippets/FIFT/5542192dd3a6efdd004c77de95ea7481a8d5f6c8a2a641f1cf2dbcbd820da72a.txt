variable x                 \ This creates a variable named 'x' in FIFT
: square                  \ This creates a colon definition named 'square'
    dup                   \ This duplicates the value on top of the stack
    *                     \ This multiplies the top two values on the stack
    ;                     \ This ends the colon definition
\ Now, let's use the square colon definition on the variable x
x 2 square .             \ This will output the square of 2, which is 4
