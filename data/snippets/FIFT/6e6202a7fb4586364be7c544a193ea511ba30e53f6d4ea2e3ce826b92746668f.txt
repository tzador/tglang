;; This program creates a Fibonacci sequence with user-defined number of terms

;; Define variables to store initial values
defvar numbers = [0 1] ;; initial sequence

defvar term_limit ;; number of terms
defvar current_term = 2 ;; starting term

;; Prompt user for the number of terms
."Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: "
number? term_limit

;; Loop through each term and calculate the next number
loop
    ;; Select the previous two terms
    numbers nth 0 defvar prev_a
    numbers nth 1 defvar prev_b

    ;; Calculate the next term
    defvar next_term
    prev_a prev_b + next_term
    
    ;; Add the next term to the sequence
    numbers push next_term

    ;; Increment the current term and check if within limit
    inc current_term
    current_term term_limit > if break endif
again

;; Output the generated Fibonacci sequence
