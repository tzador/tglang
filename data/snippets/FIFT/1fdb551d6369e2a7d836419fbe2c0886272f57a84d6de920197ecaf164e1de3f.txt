;; function to calculate the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
;; takes in a number n, returns the nth term in the sequence

def fibonacci = (n) [
    ;; initialize the first two terms in the sequence
    a = 0 ;; first term
    b = 1 ;; second term
    i = 2 ;; current term, starts at 2 because first two terms are predefined
    
    ;; recursively calculate the nth term in the sequence
    while (i <= n) [
        c = a + b ;; calculate the next term
        a = b ;; update the first term to be the current second term
        b = c ;; update the second term to be the calculated next term
        i = i + 1 ;; increment i to move to the next term
    ]
    
    ;; return the nth term
    return b
]

;; example usage
nth_term = fibonacci(10)
print(nth_term) ;; should print 55, the 10th term in the Fibonacci sequence
