/*
    This is a sample code snippet in FIFT that demonstrates
    using a loop to calculate the value of x^n, where x is a
    positive integer and n is a non-negative integer.
*/

\ In FIFT, variables are declared using the keyword 'var'
\ and are assigned a type using the colon (:) operator
var x: integer
var n: integer

\ User input is taken using the 'input()' function
x := input("Enter a positive integer value for x:")
n := input("Enter a non-negative integer value for n:")

\ We need to declare a variable to store the final result
var result: integer

\ To perform the calculation, we use a 'for' loop
for i := 0 to n do {
    \ The 'do' keyword indicates the beginning of the loop's body
    result := result * x
    \ In each iteration of the loop, x is multiplied by itself and
    \ the result is stored in the 'result' variable. The loop runs
    \ n + 1 times, as the first iteration is when i = 0.
    \ In FIFT, multiplication is performed using the asterisk (*) operator.
}

\ Finally, we print the result to the console using the 'print()' function
print("The value of x^n is:", result)

\ The output of this code snippet, when x = 2 and n = 4, will be:
\ The value of x^n is: 16

\ Note: This code only demonstrates the basic syntax of using a loop in FIFT. 
\ Actual code would include error handling and other necessary components.
