;; This code snippet is a function that calculates the maximum value of two given integers

;; Define function to take in two integers and return the maximum 
define max : a b 
{ 
  ;; Check if a is larger than b 
  % a b <= 
  { 
    % b 
  } 
  ;; If a is not larger than b, then b must be larger, so return b 
  % a 
}

;; Call function with two example integers and print the result 
% 10 16 max   ;; Output is 16
