# FIFT Code Example
# This code performs a calculation of the factorial of a given number

"FACT" [ '->!b, (0,~1,),f+]*b0 =f0 
:
 # initialize variables for factorial calculation
	"->!b" # input number is moved to stack
	(0,~1,) # initializes the variable for the factorial calculation
	f+ # performs the calculation
* # repeats the factorial calculation
b0 # top factor is moved to the stack
=f0 # outputs the final factorial value

# To use this code, replace the "FACT" with the desired input number to calculate its factorial value.
