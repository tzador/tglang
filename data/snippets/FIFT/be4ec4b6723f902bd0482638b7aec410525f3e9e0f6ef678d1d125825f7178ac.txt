;; This is an example of a function in FIFT that takes an integer as input
;; and calculates its factorial
;; The function name is "factorial" and it uses recursion to calculate the factorial

( :factorial | a -- b )
;; Declares the function "factorial" that takes integer "a" as input
;; and returns an integer "b" as output

  ( a 1 == ) ( a ) [ a 1 - recursive_call  * ] when
  ;; If input "a" is equal to 1, return "a"
  ;; Otherwise, recursively call the function with input "a-1" and multiply it with "a"

  ( error )
  ;; If input is not an integer, throw an error

;
;; End of function

;; Example usage: 5 factorial
5 factorial
