;; This code snippet is written in the FIFT programming language

;; Function to calculate the average of a list of numbers
;; Input: List of numbers
;; Output: Average of the numbers

func average (list) {
  ;; Define variables
  var total = 0
  var count = 0
  ;; Loop through list
  for num in list {
    ;; Add number to total
    total += num
    ;; Increment count
    count++
  }
  ;; Calculate average
  var average = total / count
  ;; Return average
  return average
}

;; Example usage
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
var result = average(numbers)
;; Output: 3 (because 3 is the average of the input numbers)
