''' This is a sample code snippet in FIFT, a functional programming language for the verification of smart contracts.

/* First, we define a function called 'factorial' that takes in a positive integer as its argument */
def factorial (n) {
  if n < 1 then { /* If n is less than 1, return 1 */
    1
  } else { /* Otherwise, recursively call the factorial function using n-1 as the argument */
    n * factorial(n - 1)
  }
}

''' The code above defines the factorial function. Now, let's try calling it with the value 5 and store the result in a variable called 'result'

/* Calling the factorial function with the value 5 */
let result = factorial(5)

''' Finally, we print out the result using a built-in function 'printf' and a formatted string */
printf("The factorial of %d is %d", 5, result)
