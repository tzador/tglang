;; This code snippet generates a list of all possible combinations of two numbers within a given range
;; and then prints out the list in ascending order.

cursor-point ;; sets the cursor to the beginning of the program

>> n range 1 10 ;; sets the starting and ending numbers of the range

->> list ;; declares a new list to store the combinations

{} ;; initializes an empty set to store the combinations

[ ;; begins a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers
  << n ; sets the current number as the first element of the combination
  [ ;; begins a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers again
    ->> comb ;; declares a new list to store the combination of numbers
    { ;; begins a loop to add the next number to the combination
      ->> comb ;; adds the current number to the combination
      ->> total ;; calculates the total of the current combination
      "> " print total print ;; prints out the current combination and its total
    }
  ]
  << n range ;; resets the range to start from the next number
