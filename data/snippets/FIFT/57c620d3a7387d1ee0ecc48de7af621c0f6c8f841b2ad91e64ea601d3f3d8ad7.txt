;; This is a long and complex FIFT code snippet that calculates the factorial of a given number.

;; First, create a variable `num` and assign the desired number for which the factorial will be calculated.
num 42 #assigns the number 42 to the variable `num`

;; Next, create a variable `factorial` and assign `1` to it.
factorial 1

;; Use a loop to iterate from `1` to `num`. 
;; Inside the loop, multiple the current value of `factorial` by the loop variable `i` and update `factorial`.
for i from 1 to num do
  factorial * i
endfor

;; Finally, print the calculated factorial value.
factorial . #prints the factorial value

;; Expected output: 
;; 1405006117752879898543142606244511569936384000000000
