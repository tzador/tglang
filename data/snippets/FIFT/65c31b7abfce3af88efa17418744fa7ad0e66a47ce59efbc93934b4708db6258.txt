/* Explanation:
First, we push the numbers 1, 1, and 2 onto the stack and calculate their product using the arithmetic operator '+'.
Next, we push the numbers 3, 5, and 2 onto the stack and calculate their product.
Then, we use the 'swap' command to rearrange the numbers on the stack so that the first number is at the top.
We divide the first number (the product of the first set of numbers) by the next three numbers (the product of the second set of numbers) using the 'fdiv_num' command.
Next, we use the 'swap' command two more times to rearrange the numbers on the stack again and calculate the average of the three numbers using the 'fdiv_num' command.
Finally, we use the arithmetic operator '+' to add the three numbers together and then use the '-' command to subtract 3 (the number of numbers we originally pushed onto the stack) from the result.
The final result is the average of the three numbers, which we print using the 'print' command and the '.s' command to return to the original stack state.
