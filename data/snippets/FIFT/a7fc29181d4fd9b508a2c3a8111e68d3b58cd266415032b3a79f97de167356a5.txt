<<
This code snippet creates a function called 'calculate' that takes in two values, 'a' and 'b', and computes their sum. The function then checks if the sum is greater than 100 and returns the result as a Boolean value. The code includes various control flow statements and comments to explain the logic.

// Define function 'calculate' with two parameters
: calculate
(
    a b -- sum
)
// Add values of 'a' and 'b' and store in new variable 'sum'
a b + sum

// Check if 'sum' is greater than 100
sum 100 > if
    // If so, return True
    true
else
    // If not, return False
    false
then
;

// Set values for 'a' and 'b'
5 12 calculate .
// Output: false (since sum is 17, which is not greater than 100)
14 90 calculate .
// Output: true (since sum is 104, which is greater than 100)
