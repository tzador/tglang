;; This code snippet is written in FIFT, a programming language developed by the Free TON community.
;; It calculates the factorial of a given integer using a recursive function.
;; The code uses 'define' keyword for defining functions and 'let' keyword for declaring variables.

;; Function that calculates the factorial of a given integer
(define factorial (n)
  (if (= n 0)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

;; Main function that takes user input and prints the factorial
(define main ()
  (let ((input (read "Enter an integer: ")))
    (print "The factorial of " input ":")
    (print (factorial input))))

;; Calling the main function
(main)
