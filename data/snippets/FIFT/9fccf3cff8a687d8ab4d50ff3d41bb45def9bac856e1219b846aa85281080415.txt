\ Functions
funtion sum(x, y) { # Defines function "sum" with two parameters: x and y
  return x + y  # Returns the sum of x and y
}

\ Loops
for i from 1 to 10 { # Loops from 1 to 10
  if i % 2 == 0 { # Checks if i is divisible by 2
    print(i) # Prints i if it is divisible by 2
  } else {
    continue # Skips to next iteration if i is not divisible by 2
  }
}

\ Variables
var count = 0 # Defines variable "count" and assigns it a value of 0
count = count + 5 # Reassigns the value of "count" to the sum of its current value and 5

\ Arrays
var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"] # Defines an array of fruits
fruits.push("strawberry") # Adds "strawberry" to the end of the fruits array
var first_fruit = fruits[0] # Assigns the first element in the fruits array to a variable
fruits.pop() # Removes the last element from the fruits array

\ Conditional Statements
if (fruits.length > 3) { # Checks if the fruits array has more than 3 elements
  print("There are too many fruits!") # Prints a message if the condition is true
} else {
  print("There are just enough fruits.") # Prints a message if the condition is false
}

\ Classes
class Animal { # Defines a class "Animal"
  constructor(name, age) { # Defines a constructor function with two parameters
    this.name = name # Assigns the value of name to the class property "name"
    this.age = age # Assigns the value of age to the class property "age"
  }

  introduce() { # Defines a method "introduce"
    print("Hi, my name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + " years old.") # Prints a message using class properties
  }
}

var cat = new Animal("Whiskers", 5) # Creates a new instance of Animal with name "Whiskers" and age 5
cat.introduce() # Calls the introduce method on the cat instance, printing "Hi, my name is Whiskers and I am 5 years old."
