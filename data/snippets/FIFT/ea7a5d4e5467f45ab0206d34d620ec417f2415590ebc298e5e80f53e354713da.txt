;This code snippet is a simple FIFT program that calculates and outputs the Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit.

/* Declare variables for the first two numbers in the sequence */
number1: 0
number2: 1

/* Prompt user for the limit of the sequence */
read "Enter a limit for the Fibonacci sequence: " limit

/* Print the first two numbers in the sequence */
print "Fibonacci sequence: " number1 number2

/* Loop through the sequence until the limit is reached */
while number2 < limit {
  /* Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the two previous numbers */
  nextNumber := number1 + number2

  /* Print the next number in the sequence */
  print nextNumber

  /* Shift the values to prepare for the next iteration */
  number1 := number2
  number2 := nextNumber
}
