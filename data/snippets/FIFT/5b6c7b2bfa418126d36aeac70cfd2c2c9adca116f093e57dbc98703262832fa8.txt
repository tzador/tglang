;; This code snippet demonstrates a complex mathematical function that converts a given number to its binary equivalent.

;; Creates a variable 'input' and asks user for input
(var input
  (prompt "Enter a number:"))

;; Converts the string input into an integer using the 'parseint' function
(def base
  (parsetint input))

;; Converts the integer input into binary using the 'tobinary' function
(def binary
  (tobinary base))

;; Prints the result in the form of a string
(print "The binary equivalent of " input " is " binary ".")

;; The 'tobinary' function 
(defun tobinary (num)
  ;; Local variable 'remainder' to store the remainder of division
  (var remainder)
  ;; Local variable 'binary' to store the binary equivalent
  (var binary "")

  ;; Loops until the number becomes 0
  (while (> num 0)
    ;; Computes the remainder by dividing the number by 2
    (set remainder (% num 2))
    ;; Adds the remainder to the beginning of the binary string
    (set binary (+ binary remainder))
    ;; Divides the number by 2
    (set num (/ num 2)))

  ;; Returns the binary string
  binary)
