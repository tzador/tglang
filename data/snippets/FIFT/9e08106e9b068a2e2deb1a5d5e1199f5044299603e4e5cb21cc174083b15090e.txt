;FIFT code to generate a random string of length 10:

eachn#10
$i constant length
1 randomswap
lenrandom#length $i perform

;Explanation:
;
;This code snippet uses FIFT's built-in random functions to generate a random string of length 10.
;First, the command 'eachn#10' sets the number of iterations to 10.
;Next, '$i constant length' creates a constant variable 'length' with a value of 10.
;'1 randomswap' is used to shuffle the array of numbers 1 to 10.
;'lenrandom#length $i perform' performs a random selection of 10 numbers from the shuffled array, which will be our random string.
