;; This is a code snippet in FIFT, a programming language used for functional programming.

match list { list match
;; The 'match' keyword is used to pattern match two items, here we are matching the word 'list' with itself.
;; This code will output 'list' if the match is successful.

list a b c -> c b a
;; This code snippet shows a function that takes in three arguments, 'a', 'b', and 'c', and outputs them in reversed order.

let counter = 0 in 
loop (counter 5 <=) 
[ 
    counter . (".") 
    counter 1 + counter
]
;; This code snippet shows a simple loop that counts from 0 to 5 and outputs the counter variable each time.
;; The 'let' keyword is used to declare a new variable, in this case 'counter'.
;; The 'loop' keyword is used to create a loop, the condition is in parentheses and the code to execute is enclosed in square brackets.

[a] [b] [c]
;; This code snippet shows how to create a list of three elements, 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
