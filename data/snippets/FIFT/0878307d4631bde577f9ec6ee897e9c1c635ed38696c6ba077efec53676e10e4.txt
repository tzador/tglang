{- This code snippet is a program in the FIFT programming language. FIFT is a programming language specifically designed for smart contracts on the Free TON blockchain. This program calculates the sum of two numbers and outputs the result. -}
SUM: { { x x } GET FIRST # Duplicate inputs and add them to stack
  SWAP +        # Swap the positions of inputs and add them
  PRINTLINE         # Print the result to the console
'' FIRST          # Terminate the program and return the result
;                    # End of the "SUM" function
