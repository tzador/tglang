;; This code snippet uses the FIFT programming language.
;; It generates all the prime numbers up to a given limit.

;; Define the main function
: main

  ;; Take user input for the limit
  $limit read-string "Enter the upper limit: " print

  ;; Initialize variables
  $1 "x" name
  $2 "primes" name

  ;; Loop through all numbers up to the limit
  limit 1 do
    ;; Assume current number is prime and update variables
    name %> "num" put
    $TRUE %> "is-prime" put
    "num" name %> "div" put

    ;; Loop through all numbers up to the current number
    i "div" get do
      "num" name i get /mod

      ;; If remainder is 0, number is not prime
      dup $0 == if
        $FALSE "is-prime" put
        break
      then
    loop

    ;; Add prime number to list if it is still set to true
    "is-prime" get not if
      "num" name %> "primes" get []
      swap push
      "primes" name %> "primes" put
    then
  loop

  ;; Print the list of prime numbers
  "primes" get print
