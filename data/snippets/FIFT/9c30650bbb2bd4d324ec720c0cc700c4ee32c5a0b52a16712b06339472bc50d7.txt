;; This code snippet generates a matrix of random integers and multiplies it with a vector
let matrix: [][]integer ; declare a matrix
set matrix = generate_matrix(10, 10) ; call the 'generate_matrix' method to create a 10x10 matrix

let vector: []integer ; declare a vector
set vector = generate_vector(10) ; create a vector of size 10 using the 'generate_vector' method

let result: []integer ; declare a vector to store the result of matrix multiplication

;; loop through each row in the matrix
for row in matrix:
    ;; initialize a variable to store the sum of multiplication for each row
    let row_sum: integer = 0

    ;; loop through each element in the row
    for element in row:
        ;; multiply the element with the corresponding element in the vector and add it to the row sum
        set row_sum = row_sum + element * vector[row.index]
    ;; add the row sum to the 'result' vector
    set result = result + [row_sum]

;; print the result
print("The result of matrix-vector multiplication is: ", result)
