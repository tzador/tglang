;; This code snippet is a basic function for calculating the average of an array of numbers
;; It utilizes FIFT's map and fold operations to compute the average

;; Define the function
average { `array -list! } -list!

;; Use map to convert each element of the array to a float
array 'f map 'map_float

;; Use fold to sum all elements of the converted array
0 f fold

;; Divide the sum by the length of the array to get the average
map_float length /

;; Output the result
.lt. "The average of the array is: " . 2 dip append_dt

;; Examples of using this function with different arrays
#([1 2 3 4]) average
#([10 20 30 40]) average
