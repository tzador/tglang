(* This is a complex function in FIFT that calculates the nth Fibonacci number *)

& $: %  # f(n) -- f(n), where f(n) is the nth Fibonacci number
&0 <> $: %  # checks if n is not equal to 0
* $: % &< $ # recursive call to f(n-1)
2# % ... % # performs the appropriate calculations and returns the result
{ &; } % # retrieves the stored result of f(n-1)
&1 <> $: % # checks if n is not equal to 1
* $: % &<- $ # recursive call to f(n-2)
2# % ... % # performs the appropriate calculations and returns the result
{ &; } % # retrieves the stored result of f(n-2)
&+ % # adds the two retrieved results together
$; % # returns the final calculated result
&0 $: % # base case for when n is equal to 0
# 0 # returns 0 as the Fibonacci number for n=0
&1 $: % # base case for when n is equal to 1
# 1 # returns 1 as the Fibonacci number for n=1
