// This is a code snippet in FIFT (Fift Interactive Forth Tool), a compiled, low-level programming language.
// It includes a complex function that calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive approach.

\ The factorial function takes in a number and returns the factorial of that number
: factorial ( n -- n! )
    dup 1 = if     // if n is equal to 1, return 1
        exit
    else
       dup 1 -     // subtract 1 from n
       factorial   // recursively call the factorial function on the new value of n
       *           // multiply the returned value with n to get n!
    then
;

\ Main Function
: main
    ." Enter a number: "     // prompt the user to enter a number
    read                      // read in a number from user
    factorial                 // call factorial function
    ." The factorial is: " .  // print the factorial result
;

// To execute the program and see the output, run the following commands in the FIFT console:
// `: main execute` - this defines the main function and executes it
// `: main` - this calls the main function and executes it, printing the factorial result.
