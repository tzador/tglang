# Program to calculate the factorial of a number

# Initialize variables
# 'f' stores the factorial value
# 'num' stores the number whose factorial is to be calculated
$f 0
$num 10

# Loop to calculate factorial
[ 
    # Multiply 'f' by 'num' and store in 'f'
    $f $f $num mul
    
    # Subtract 1 from 'num'
    # 1 is subtracted at the end to avoid multiplying with 0
    $num 1 sub 
    
    # Update 'num' with new value 
    $num 
    # If 'num' is greater than 0, loop again
] while{ $num 0 > }

# Output the factorial value
