# Define a function to calculate the average of an array
func average(arr):
  # Initialize sum variable to 0
  sum = 0
  # Loop through the array
  for item in arr:
    # Add each item in the array to the sum variable
    sum = sum + item
  # Calculate the length of the array
  length = len(arr)
  # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length
  avg = sum / length
  # Return the average
  return avg

# Example array
array = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

# Call the average function and store the result in a variable
result = average(array)

# Print the result
print("The average of the array is", result)

# Output: The average of the array is 15
