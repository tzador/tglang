;; Fibonacci series generator in FIFT
;; Author: John Doe

;; Declare variables
zero := 0
one := 1
current := zero
next := one
count := 20 ;; Change this value to generate more or less numbers in the series

; Main body of the program
loop count times
    ; Print the current number in the series using Fift's `print` function
    print current
    ; Calculate the next number in the series
    temp := next
    next := current + next
    current := temp
endloop
