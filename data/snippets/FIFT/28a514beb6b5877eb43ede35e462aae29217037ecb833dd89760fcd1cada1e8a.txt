;;; This is a complex code snippet in FIFT ;;;
;;; It uses multiple functions and datatypes ;;;
;;; to perform various operations ;;; 

;;; Defining a function that checks if a given number is even or odd ;;; 
define even_or_odd (num)
  set result = num % 2
  if result == 0 then
    return "even"
  else 
    return "odd"

;;; Creating a list of even and odd numbers ;;; 
set numbers = [2, 5, 10, 3, 8, 16, 7, 12, 9] 

;;; Looping through the numbers list using 'map' function ;;; 
set even_or_odd_list = map (numbers, `(even_or_odd _)`)

;;; Printing the result ;;; 
print "List of even and odd numbers: ", even_or_odd_list 

;;; Defining a function to calculate the average of a list of numbers ;;; 
define calculate_average (num_list)
  set sum = 0
  set count = 0
  for num in num_list do
    set sum += num
    set count += 1
  set average = sum / count
  return average

;;; Calculating average of numbers list ;;; 
set average = calculate_average (numbers) 

;;; Printing the result ;;; 
print "The average of the numbers list is: ", average
