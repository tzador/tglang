##Explanation:
In FIFT, a function named factorial_procedure is defined to calculate the factorial of a given number. The function takes in a number and duplicates it on the stack. It then checks if the duplicated number is equal to 0, if it is, the function returns 1 as this is the base case for factorial. If the number is not equal to 0, it decreases the number by 1, duplicates it, and then multiplies it with the factorial of the decremented number. This process continues until the base case is reached and the result is returned. When the sample input of 5 is given, the function will first call itself with n = 5, then decrease n by 1 and call itself again until n = 0. Finally, the result of n factorial_procedure is printed, which should be 120 in this case.
