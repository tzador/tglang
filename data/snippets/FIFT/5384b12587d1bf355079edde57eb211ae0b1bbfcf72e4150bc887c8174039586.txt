/*This FIFT snippet creates a function to calculate the average of a list of numbers*/
function Average(numbers) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        total += numbers[i];
    }
    return total / numbers.length;
}

//Usage
let numbers = [3, 5, 12, 8];
let average = Average(numbers);
console.log(average); // outputs 7

/*Explanation:
This function takes in an array of numbers and uses a for loop to calculate the total sum.
Then, it divides the total by the length of the array to get the average and returns it.
Finally, we can use the function by passing in an array of numbers and storing the returned average in a variable.
We can then print the average using console.log().
