# This code snippet is a simple FIFT program that implements a binary search algorithm.

# Define a variable to hold the target value we are searching for
#'x' is the value we want to find in the sorted list 'a'

variable x

# Define an array 'a' that contains the sorted list of numbers to search in
#[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

variable a [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

# Declare variables to store the starting index 'low' and the ending index 'high' of the search range
variable low
variable high

# Declare a variable to store the middle index of the search range
variable mid

# Initialize the starting and ending index values
0 low !
