:# This is a sample code snippet in FIFT (Fake Interactive Fiction Template).
:# It is used to create a function that counts the characters in a string and outputs the result.

:# Define the function `count_characters` with two parameters
:define count_characters s char_count
{
    :# Initialize variable `counter` to store the count value
    s "" =counter

    :# Loop through characters in the string using `for` loop
    :a 0
    {"done" {dup "done" -! @counter ++}{} {dup @counter ++ dup}}
    for s
    :# Store the current character in variable `c`
    PopDeclare c

    :# Check if `c` is equal to `char_count`
    c char_count =not
    dup "done" =if
    ;;                             :# If not equal, increment `counter`
    counter +!
    else
    ;;                             :# If equal, output the result
    counter .e
    done

    :# Return the final count value
    counter
};

:# Call the function `count_characters` and pass in a string and character as arguments
: "Hello World!" 'l' count_characters .e
