// The code snippet above defines a function called "area" that takes in two arguments, x and y,
// and calculates the area of a rectangle with sides x and y. It uses Forth's postfix notation
// where the function name comes after the arguments. The annotations after each line explain
// the purpose of the code.

// To use this function, the following code can be used:

4 5 area . \ outputs 20, which is the area of a rectangle with sides 4 and 5

// The . after "area" indicates that the function should display the result instead of keeping
// it on the stack. This is the only line that is not part of the code snippet.
