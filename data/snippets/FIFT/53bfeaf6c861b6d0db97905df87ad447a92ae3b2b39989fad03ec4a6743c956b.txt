;;This code snippet generates a Fibonacci sequence in FIFT

;;Define the main function 
:def main

;;We'll use the stack to store the calculated values
;;First, push 1 and 0 as the first two values of the sequence
1 0 nput

;;We'll use a loop to generate the rest of the sequence
;;Duplicate the top two values so we can add them together and push the result to the stack
2 *dup +

;;Loop through the sequence n times, where n is defined by the user
;;Keep pushing the next value to the stack
nput 1 +loop

;;Now, we'll use a loop to print out each value in the sequence
;;First, initialize a counter to keep track of the number of values printed
0 0 nput

;;Loop until the counter reaches the size of the sequence
;;Print the value at the top of the stack and increment the counter
[:p @ 0/+@ @:p @] until

;;End of main function
;;Output the final result which should be the Fibonacci sequence
