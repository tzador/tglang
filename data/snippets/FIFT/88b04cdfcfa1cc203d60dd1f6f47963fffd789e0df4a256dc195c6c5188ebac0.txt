let str = "Hello" // This variable is of type string


/*
FIFT also supports arrays, which can hold multiple elements of the same data type
An array can be initialized using the 'array' keyword
*/
let arr = array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] // This array holds 5 integer values


/*
FIFT also has functions, which can be declared using the 'fun' keyword
A function can take in parameters and returns a value
