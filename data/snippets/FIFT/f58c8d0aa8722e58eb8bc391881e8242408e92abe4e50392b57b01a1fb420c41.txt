!!! This is an example of a long and complex code snippet in FIFT programming language !!!

NODE SDL:

    CELLPUSHSRC {

        { x 1 } "String" # pushes value 1 onto the stack, assigns label "String" to it
        { x 2 } "Integer" # pushes value 2 onto the stack, assigns label "Integer" to it
        { x 3 } "Double" # pushes value 3 onto the stack, assigns label "Double" to it

    } <<

        PUSH # pushes value 5 onto the stack
        DUP "Integer" @ @INT32 = ? # duplicates it and checks if it is an Integer
        ?CONST ? ABSTYPE # checks if it is a constant or abstract type
        ?STATVAL # checks if it is a static value
        >RDROP # discards stack top if all checks passed, leaving only value 5 on the stack
