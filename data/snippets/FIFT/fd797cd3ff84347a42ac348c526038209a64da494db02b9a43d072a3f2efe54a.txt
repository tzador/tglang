;; This is a complex code snippet written in FIFT, programming language
;; designed for developing smart contracts on the Free TON blockchain platform.

;; First, we define a new function called "calculate" which takes in a list
;; of two numbers and performs various calculations on them.

((calculate) IS):
    `DS 2`  checkdepth  ?DUP (-2 =)
    IF (the list does not contain exactly two elements)
        `DROP "ERR: LIST NOT EXACTLY TWO ELEMENTS"` THROW
    THEN ;

;; Next, we define a new smart contract called "MultFunction" which uses the
;; previously defined "calculate" function to perform a multiplication operation
;; on two numbers provided by the user.

MultFunction:
    `DUP 0 ?DUP`
    IF (the number provided is not zero)
        `DUP calculate`
        `(INT).` (print the result of the calculation)
        `DROP` (drop the result from the stack)
    THEN
    `DROP` (drop the provided number from the stack) ;
    
;; Finally, we deploy the "MultFunction" smart contract on the Free TON blockchain
;; and verify its functionality by providing two numbers for multiplication.

;; Deploy the contract
`"MultFunction" contract deploy`

;; Provide the two numbers for multiplication
`DCHG 3 5` (3 and 5 are now on the stack)

;; Invoke the contract
`CALLSLIST "MultFunction"`

;; The output should be 15 on the top of the stack, which is the result of 3 * 5.
