// This code snippet is used to generate a random secure password in FIFT programming language

// Defining a constant array containing all the characters that can be used in the password
CONST @CHARS "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;':,./<>?"

// Defining a variable to store the length of the password
VAR @LENGTH

// Defining a random function to generate a random number between a given range
FUNC @RANDOM(min, max) {
    // Using FIFT's inbuilt function to generate a random number
    RAND(min, max);
}

// Defining a variable to store the generated password
VAR @PASSWORD = ""

// Getting user input for the desired length of the password
GET @LENGTH
// Type "INT" indicated that the user input should be of type integer
// "LENGTH" is the variable name that will store the input value
// "?" is used as a prompt for the user to enter the desired length

// Looping through the desired length to generate each character of the password
FOR @I 0 TO @LENGTH {
    // Generating a random index number within the length of the CHAR array
    VAR @INDEX = @RANDOM(0, LEN(@CHARS)-1)
    // Appending the randomly selected character to the PASSWORD variable
    @PASSWORD = @PASSWORD || @CHARS[@INDEX]
}

// Printing the generated password to the user
PRINT @PASSWORD
// Type "STR" indicates that the variable is of type string
// Note: the output will also contain the single quotation marks as part of the string

// Note: This code snippet is just for demonstration purposes and is not secure enough to actually generate passwords for personal use.
