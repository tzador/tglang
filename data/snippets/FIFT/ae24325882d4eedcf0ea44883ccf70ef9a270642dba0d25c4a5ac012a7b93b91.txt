;; This is a complex code snippet written in FIFT, a functional programming language.

;; Define a function called 'factorial' that takes in a number 'n' as an argument and returns the factorial value of 'n'
factorial: ( n -- n! ) 
  dup 1 < if
    drop 1
  else
    dup 
    1- factorial

;; Define a recursive function called 'fibonacci' that takes in a number 'n' as an argument and returns the fibonacci value at the nth position
fibonacci: ( n -- nth fibonacci value )
  dup 2 < if
    drop 1
  else
    dup 1- fibonacci
    rot 2- fibonacci
    +

;; Define a function called 'reverse' that takes in a list 'lst' as an argument and returns the reversed list
reverse: ( lst -- reversed lst )

;; Define a function called 'sum' that takes in a list 'lst' as an argument and returns the sum of all the elements in the list
sum: ( lst -- sum of elements )
  0 swap [ + ] fold ;

;; Define a function called 'map' that takes in a list 'lst' and a function 'f' as arguments and returns a new list after applying 'f' to each element in the list
map: ( lst f -- mapped list )
  () swap

;; Define a function called 'filter' that takes in a list 'lst' and a predicate function 'p' as arguments and returns a new list with elements that satisfy the predicate function
filter: ( lst p -- filtered list )
  () swap
  [ swap execute [ p ] execute if cons ] filterit ;
  ( filterit is a helper function that filters elements in the list based on the predicate condition )

;; Define a recursive function called 'binary_search' that takes in a list 'lst', an element 'x' and length 'n' as arguments and returns the index of 'x' in the list if present, otherwise returns -1

;; Define a function called 'is_palindrome' that takes in a string 'str' as an argument and returns whether the string is a palindrome or not
is_palindrome: ( str -- true if palindrome, false otherwise )

;; Define a function called 'calculate_fuel_cost' that takes in a list of tuples 'lst' with elements (distance, fuel efficiency) and returns the total fuel cost for the journey
