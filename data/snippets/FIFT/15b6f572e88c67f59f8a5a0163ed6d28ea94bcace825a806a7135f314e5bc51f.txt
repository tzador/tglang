# Function to calculate the factorial of a number
DEFINITION * factorial
(
    <int:n> # Input number
)
{
    <int:result> # Variable to store the result

    # Base case
    IF n EQUALS 0 {
        ASSIGN result TO 1 # Set result to 1
    }
    # Recursive case
    ELSE {
        ASSIGN result TO 1 #Initialize result to 1
        FORLOOP <int:i> FROM 1 TO n { # Loop from 1 to n
            MULT result BY i # Multiply result by current loop index
        }
    }

    # Print result
    PRINT "Factorial of " + n + " is: " + result
}

# Call the factorial function
CALL factorial WITH 5
