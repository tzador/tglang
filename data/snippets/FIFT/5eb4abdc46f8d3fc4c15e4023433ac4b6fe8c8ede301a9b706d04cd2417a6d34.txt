# This is a complex code snippet in FIFT
# It takes an input string and outputs its length and reverse
# by using recursion and loop

// First, we define a recursive function to calculate the length of a string
// The function takes in a string as an argument and returns its length
// If the string is empty, the length is 0
: len ( s -- n )
   s null? IF 0 EXIT THEN   \ If string is empty, exit with 0
   s 1 cut 1+ SWAP len     \ Recursively call len with substring and add 1
;

// Next, we define a loop to reverse the input string using the len function
// The loop takes in a string as an argument and iterates through each character
// It uses len function to calculate the length of the string and swaps characters
: reverse ( s -- s )
   <>                      \ Initialize stack for loop
   {                       \ Begin loop
      len SWAP ROT         \ Calculate length of string and swap top 2 elements
      3 pick 1 pick 1 cut  \ Get first character from string
      <> SWAP <>          \ Swap top 2 elements on stack
      OVER                 \ Get second character from string
      -rot                 \ Put first character on top of stack
      1 cut 1 cut          \ Remove first character from string
      len SWAP >IF         \ Check if length of string is greater than 0
         1 pick reverse    \ Recursively call reverse with substring
      ENDIF
   } loop                  \ Loop until all characters have been swapped
   1 pick                   \ Get final result from stack
;

// Finally, we call the reverse function with an input string and print the result
"Hello, World!" reverse . cr

// Output:
// "!dlroW ,olleH"
