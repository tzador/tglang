; This code generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit

; Define a constant for the limit
!limit = 10

; Initialize the sequence with first two values
!sequence = [0, 1]

; Create a loop to generate the sequence
; The loop will terminate when the next value exceeds the limit
[ set n !sequence <# 2 pick > limit ?dup
  [break,] if
  nip swap over +
  unloop swap

; Output the generated sequence
; The output is a list of numbers separated by a tab character
