(:: Let's define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number ::)

: factorial | n! ( n -- fact )
   0 swap!
   begin
     dup 1 < while
     2dup * swap 1 -
   repeat ;

(:: The function takes in the parameter 'n' and outputs the factorial of 'n' in the 'fact' variable ::)

(:: Let's test the function by calculating the factorial of 5 ::)

5 factorial

(:: The output should be '120' as 5! is equal to 120 ::)
