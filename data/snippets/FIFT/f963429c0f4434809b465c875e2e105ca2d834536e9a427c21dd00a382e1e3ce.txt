\ This program calculates the frequencies of each character in a given string
\ Example input: "Hello World"
\ Output: h:1, e:1, l:3, o:2, w:1, r:1, d:1

\ First we define the string to be analyzed
HELLO WORLD "str"

\ Next, we define an empty map to hold our character frequencies
{} "map"

\ We loop through each character in our string
"str" { CHAR "str" CHAR+ -> c \

\ We check if the current character is already in our map
"map" c {} IF -> exists \

\ If the character exists in our map, we increment its frequency by 1
exists { c CALL-> freq1 1 INT+ freq2 -> freq \

\ Otherwise, we add the character to our map with a frequency of 1
{ c 1 } { freq1 } IFTE \

\ We add the updated map back into the original map
freq2 -> "map" { freq } { c } PUT \

} DO \

\ Finally, we print out the frequencies of each character
"map" { , } { "; " } MAP-> STR ", " . "Output: " PRINT \
