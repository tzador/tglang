# Implements a function to find the common prefix of two strings

# Declaring the function with two input parameters x and y
: findCommonPrefix { x y -- prefix }
    # Creating two temporary variables to store the lengths of the input strings
    !xlen 'x length ;
    !ylen 'y length ;

    # Creating a temporary buffer to store the common prefix
    !buffer here ;

    # Looping through each character of the shorter string
    xlen min
    # Storing the current character of the shorter string in the buffer
    { 'currentChar $
        # Checking if the current character is equal to the character at the same position in the longer string
        'x i + na x 'currentChar na =
        # If they are equal, move on to the next character
        {i 1 + meat}
        # If they are not equal, exit the loop
        { break }
        # Once the loop is completed, the value of i will be the index of the last character in the common prefix
    } loop

    # Truncating the buffer to the length of the common prefix
    !buffer here +>i ;

    # Returning the common prefix as a string
    buffer>string
