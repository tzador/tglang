# FIFT Program to reverse a string
#
# This program takes in a string from the user and reverses it
# using a stack data structure.

# Create a stack as an array
stack: ARRAY

# Take in input string from user
in: STRING

# Loop through the string and push each character onto the stack
STRING {
    # Get the current character
    GETCHAR DUP
    # Push it onto the stack
    stack +!
    # Move to the next character
    1 +
} FOREACH

# Create an empty string to store the reversed string
out: ""

# Loop through the stack and pop off each character
ARRAY {
    # Pop off the last character
    stack !
    # Append it to the end of the output string
    out +
} FOREACH

# Print the reversed string
out .

# Output:
# User input: "hello"
# Reversed string: "olleh"
