*% This code snippet uses the FIFT programming language for a complex mathematical calculation and outputting the result%*

/* Define a function that takes in two input integers and returns the sum of the two*/
: ADD ( n1 n2 -- n3 )
  # Add the two input numbers
  # Variables n1 and n2 are popped off the stack and the result is pushed onto the stack

/* Define a function that takes in two input integers and returns the product of the two */
: MULTIPLY ( n1 n2 -- n3 )
  # Multiply the two input numbers
  # Variables n1 and n2 are popped off the stack and the result is pushed onto the stack
  n1 n2 * ;

/* Define a function that takes in two input integers and returns the difference of the two */
: SUBTRACT ( n1 n2 -- n3 )
  # Subtract the second input number from the first
  # Variables n1 and n2 are popped off the stack and the result is pushed onto the stack
  n1 n2 - ;

/* Define a function that takes in two input integers and returns the quotient of the two */
: DIVIDE ( n1 n2 -- n3 )
  # Divide the first input number by the second
  # Variables n1 and n2 are popped off the stack and the result is pushed onto the stack
  n1 n2 / ;

/* Define a function that takes in two input integers and performs a complex mathematical calculation */
: CALCULATION ( n1 n2 -- result )
  # Call the ADD function to find the sum of the two input numbers
  n1 n2 ADD

  # Call the MULTIPLY function to find the product of the two input numbers
  n1 n2 MULTIPLY

  # Call the SUBTRACT function to find the difference of the two input numbers
  n1 n2 SUBTRACT

  # Call the DIVIDE function to find the quotient of the two input numbers
  n1 n2 DIVIDE ;

/* Call the CALCULATION function with input numbers 10 and 5, and output the result */
