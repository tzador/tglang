(*This is a code snippet in FIFT, a programming language designed for creating and managing smart contracts on the TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain.*)

!{cnt} @ (",m * ") @ ifelse dup @ {st0} @ # _{true} @ {body} @

(*The code uses comments to explain the purpose of each line.*)

'SomeVariable' {cnt} Set (*Sets the value of variable 'SomeVariable' to the output of the 'cnt' function*)

{cnt} @ (*Calls the 'cnt' function, which returns a number*)

(",m * ") @ (*Multiplies the output of the 'cnt' function by the string ",m * "*)

ifelse (*If the output of the 'cnt' function is not zero, then execute the first part of the code, otherwise execute the second part*)

(*The following lines are executed when the condition in the ifelse statement is true*)

dup @ (*Duplicates the output of the 'cnt' function*)

{st0} @ (*Sets the output of the 'cnt' function as the top of the stack*)

# (*Pops the top of the stack and returns it*)

_{true} @ (*Pushes the boolean value 'true' onto the stack*)

{body} @ (*Executes the code in the 'body' of the code snippet, using the duplicated output of the 'cnt' function as a parameter*)

(*The following lines are executed when the condition in the ifelse statement is false*)

(*Since there is no code in the false part, the program will simply end*)

(*The final output of this code snippet will be the original output of the 'cnt' function multiplied by the string ",m*" if the condition is true, and the original output of the 'cnt' function if the condition is false.*)
