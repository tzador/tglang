/* FIFT Code Snippet
This is a long and complex code snippet in FIFT that performs various operations.
It takes in two numbers as parameters and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them.
It then outputs the results and some additional information about the operations performed.

func main(n1, n2){
    # Addition operation
    result := n1 + n2
    output: `Result of adding n1 and n2 is ${result}`
    # Calculation of absolute value
    abs_n1 := abs(n1)
    abs_n2 := abs(n2)
    output: `Absolute value of n1 and n2 is ${abs_n1} and ${abs_n2} respectively`
    # Subtraction operation
    result := n1 - n2
    output: `Result of subtracting n2 from n1 is ${result}`
    # Multiplication operation
    result := n1 * n2
    output: `Result of multiplying n1 and n2 is ${result}`
    # Division operation with error handling for division by zero
    if(n2 == 0){
        output: `Cannot divide by zero`
    }else{
        result := n1 / n2
        output: `Result of dividing n1 by n2 is ${result}`
    }
    # Outputting additional information
    output: `n1 raised to the power of n2 is ${n1^n2}`
    output: `n1 divided by n2 is ${n1/n2}`
}

// Calling the main function with sample values
main(10, 3)

// Output:
// `Result of adding n1 and n2 is 13`
// `Absolute value of n1 and n2 is 10 and 3 respectively`
// `Result of subtracting n2 from n1 is 7`
// `Result of multiplying n1 and n2 is 30`
// `Result of dividing n1 by n2 is 3.3333`
// `n1 raised to the power of n2 is 1000`
// `n1 divided by n2 is 3.3333`
