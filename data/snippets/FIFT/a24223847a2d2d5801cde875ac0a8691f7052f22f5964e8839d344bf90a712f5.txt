;; This is a code snippet in FIFT, a functional programming language for smart contract development

;; Declare a function named 'multiply' that takes two arguments 'x' and 'y'
(multiply (x y)
  ;; Multiply the two arguments and assign the result to a new variable 'result'
  (let ((result (* x y)))
    ;; Print the result to the console
    (print result))
)

;; Call the function with arguments 5 and 10
(multiply (5 10))
