;; This is a comment in FIFT language
;; The following code block creates a list of numbers
{ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 }

;; We will now perform some operations on this list
;; We will calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list
{ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 }    ;; The list of numbers
  ;; This is a comment indentation
=   ;; Indicates that the previous operand is the list we are operating on
: reduce ( sum )    ;; Function that will be applied to the list
{ +1 * }           ;; These are the operators used in the function (adds 1 and multiplies)
=        ;; Indicates the end of the reduce function
apply       ;; Applies the function to the list

;; The result of the calculation is 55, which should be outputted
print "The sum of the numbers 1 to 10 is " .              ;; Prints the string
exch   ;; Exchanges the top two values on the stack
print  ;; Prints the top value on the stack (the result of the calculation)
