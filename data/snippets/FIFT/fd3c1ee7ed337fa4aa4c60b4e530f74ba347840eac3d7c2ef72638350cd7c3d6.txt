{
    \ Define functions for calculating simple and compound interest rates
    : simple-interest ( P N R -- I ) \ Calculates simple interest
        N R * P * I ;

    : compound-interest ( P N R -- I ) \ Calculates compound interest
        N R pow P * I ;

    \ Define variables for use in calculations 
    \ P = Principle, N = Number of time periods, R = Interest rate, I = Interest amount
    1000 constant P
    2 constant N
    0.05 constant R
    0 constant I

    \ Calculate simple and compound interest rates for 2 time periods
    P N R simple-interest I ! \ Save simple interest amount to variable I
    P N R compound-interest I ! \ Save compound interest amount to variable I

    \ Display results
    "Simple Interest: " I  \ Print simple interest amount
    "Compound Interest: " I \ Print compound interest amount
