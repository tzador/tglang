::A multiple arithmetic operation program in Fift language::

#push stack (2 dup mul 5 add 3 sub) '5'
'explanation' 2 dup mul #duplicate the topmost element in stack, then multiply it by itself
5 add #add 5 to the previous result
3 sub #subtract 3 from the previous result
; 'closing semi-colon' 5 #push 5 to the stack

#output stack
#expected result: 20

?exec #execute the operations in the stack, result is pushed to the stack
#output stack
#expected result: 20

#display result
10. emit #print the result as a floating point number
#expected output: 20.0
