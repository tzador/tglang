;; This is a sample code snippet in FIFT, a functional programming language designed for financial applications.

;; The following function calculates the compound interest for a given principal amount, interest rate and time period.

(define (compound-interest principal rate time)
  (* principal (expt (+ 1 (/ rate 100)) time)))

;; This function takes in three parameters - principal amount, interest rate and time in years.
;; The interest rate is divided by 100 to convert from percentage to decimal.
;; The expt procedure is used to calculate the result of (1 + (rate/100))^time.
;; The compound interest is then calculated by multiplying the principal amount with the result of the expt procedure.

;; Here's an example of using this function to calculate compound interest for $1000 at an annual interest rate of 5% for a period of 5 years.

(compound-interest 1000 5 5)
