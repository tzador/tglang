# this code snippet is an example of a recursive function in FIFT

# define a function called 'factorial' that takes in a parameter 'n'
factorial[n] {
    # if n is equal to 0, return 1
    if eqz[n] {
        1
    } else {
        # otherwise, recursively call the function with n-1 and multiply it with n
        * [n, factorial[-1, n]]
    }
}

# call the factorial function with input 5 and print the result
print(factorial[5])
