;; This is a sample code snippet written in the FIFT programming language
"Hello, World!" println ;; prints 'Hello, World!'
[ 1 2 3 ] { x }fold ;; takes in a list and performs a function on each element
{ x x * } {} { add } catch ;; performs a multiplication operation and adds the result to accumulator
[1, 2, 3] |> map {|x| x + 1 } ;; performs a map operation to increment each element in the list
[1, 2, 3] add ;; adds all the elements in the list
<<
[1, 2, 3] { x }fold
{ x x * }
2 &&
>> ;; performs a logical AND operation on the result of the previous fold operation
'Hello, World!' $string->hexstr ;; converts the string into a hexadecimal representation
"Hello, World!" { x }assert-code TRUE ;; asserts that the previous string is equal to "Hello, World!"
