# This is a FIFT code snippet that creates a simple function
# called 'countdown' which takes in one parameter, 'num' 
# and counts down from that number to 1, printing each number
# on a new line.

: countdown ( num -- )
    # Here, we save the current value of 'num' in a variable called 'count'
    dup count !
    # This is a loop that keeps decrementing 'count' by 1 until it reaches 1
    begin
        # Print the current value of 'count'
        count . cr
        # Decrement 'count' by 1
        count 1 - count !
    # This is the condition for the loop to continue
    # It checks if 'count' is greater than 1
    # If so, the loop continues, otherwise it ends
    count 1 > until
