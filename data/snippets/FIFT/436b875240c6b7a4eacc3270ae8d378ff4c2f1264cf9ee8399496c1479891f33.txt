; This is a sample FIFT code snippet in annotated markdown.
; It contains a simple Fibonacci function that calculates the nth term.
; Input: n (int) - the term to be calculated
; Output: n (int) - the calculated term

; Declare the function and its parameters
fun fib(n: int)
{
    ; Define the initial terms (0 and 1)
    var term1: int = 0
    var term2: int = 1
    
    ; Create a loop that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term
    for i in range(n)
    {
        ; Update the terms by adding the previous two terms
        var temp: int = term1
        term1 = term2
        term2 = temp + term1
    }
    
    ; Return the nth term
    return term1
}

; Call the function and store the result in a variable
var result: int = fib(10)

; Print the result to the console
print(result)
