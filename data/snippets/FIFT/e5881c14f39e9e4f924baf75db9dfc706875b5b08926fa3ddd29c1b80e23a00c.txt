! Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
: factorial ( n -- n! )
  dup 0 <= ( If n is less than or equal to 0, return 1 )
  swap 1 > ( If n is greater than 1, continue )
  IF ( If n is 1, exit the loop and return factorial )
    swap dup 1 - recurse * ( Decrement n by 1, multiply with the previous result, and recurse )
  THEN ( End of loop )
