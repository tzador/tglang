;; This code snippet is an example of a Fibonacci sequence generator in FIFT.
;; It takes input from the user, generates the sequence up to the given input, and prints it out.

;; Declare a variable to store the user input
variable user-input

;; Declare a variable to store the previous two numbers in the sequence
variable prev-2

;; Declare a variable to store the previous number in the sequence
variable prev-1

;; Assign the value of the user input to the user-input variable
79 user-input !

;; Assign the first two numbers in the sequence (0 and 1) to the prev-2 and prev-1 variables
0 prev-2 !
1 prev-1 !

;; Declare a recursive function to generate the Fibonacci sequence
: fibonacci ( n -- )
  dup 2 < (
    ;; If the input is less than 2, simply print the input as it is
    dup .
  ) else (
    ;; Otherwise, calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
    prev-2 @ prev-1 @ + dup .
    ;; Update the values of prev-2 and prev-1 with the new number
    prev-1 !
    prev-2 @ prev-1 !
    ;; Call the function again with the new input (n-1)
    1- fibonacci
  ) then ;

;; Call the fibonacci function with the user input as the parameter
user-input @ fibonacci
