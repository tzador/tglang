!!! conv_seq and conv_single methods are used for converting values in a single sequence.
!!! The method conv_single takes in the variables i, a, x, b, c, len and returns the next length.
!!! The method conv_seq takes in a single sequence and returns the converted value.
!!! The conversion process involves using the invoke_boc_over? function and checking if it equals 0.
!!! If it is equal to 0, the function inshift is called.
!!! The conv_seq function uses a switch statement to handle different cases, and stores the resulting value in the registers.
!!! The methods also use the dist function to calculate the distance between the two values, and the fs function to convert the values to the required format.
!!! Finally, the errate function is used to handle any errors that may occur during the conversion process.
