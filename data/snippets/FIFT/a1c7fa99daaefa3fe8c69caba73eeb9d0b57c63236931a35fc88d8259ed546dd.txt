;; Function to calculate the factorial of a number

(set! factorial (lambda (n) 
  ;; n is the input number
  (if (= n 0) 
    ;; if n is 0, return 1
    1   
    ;; else, multiply n by factorial of (n-1) recursively 
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
  )
))

;; Example usage:
(factorial 5) ;; This will output 120, which is 5 factorial

;; This function uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number. 
;; It checks if the input number is 0, in which case it returns 1. 
;; Otherwise, it multiplies the input number by the factorial of (n-1).
