;; This is a code snippet in FIFT
;; It contains long and complex code for generating a pyramid using symbols

;; Declare a variable "height" for the height of the pyramid
height = 10

;; Declare a variable "space" for the number of spaces needed in each row
space = height - 1

;; Declare a variable "symbol" for the symbols to be used in the pyramid
symbol = "* "

;; Loop for generating each row of the pyramid
for (i = 1; i <= height; i ++)
{
  ;; Loop for printing spaces in each row
  for (j = 1; j <= space; j ++)
  {
    ;; Print a space
    print "  "
  }

  ;; Decrease the number of spaces for the next row
  space --

  ;; Loop for printing symbols in each row
  for (j = 1; j <= i; j ++)
  {
    ;; Print the symbol
    print symbol
  }

  ;; Loop for printing symbols in reverse for the second half of the pyramid
  for (j = i - 1; j >= 1; j --)
  {
    ;; Print the symbol
    print symbol
  }

  ;; Print a new line
  print "\n"
