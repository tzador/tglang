//This code snippet demonstrates the use of functions and loops in FIFT

//Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
func factorial(n) {
  if n == 0 {
    return 1
  }
  else {
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  }
}

//Declare a variable to store the value of the factorial
var result = 0

//Loop through a range of numbers and calculate the factorial for each one
for i in 1..10 {
  result = factorial(i)
}

//Print the result to the console
print("The factorial of 10 is: ", result)
