{ The following code snippet uses FIFT, a programming language designed for smart contracts.
  It creates a smart contract that allows two parties to make a bet by depositing their funds and choosing a random number.
  If the chosen number matches a randomly generated number, the contract will pay out the funds to the winning party.
  Otherwise, the funds will remain in the contract until a new bet is made.
}

main:

{ This section defines the main function that will be executed when the contract is deployed. }

{ Declare two variables to store the addresses of the two parties involved in the bet. }
$first_party
$second_party

{ Declare a variable to store the bet amount. }
$bet_amount

{ Declare a variable to store the chosen number. }
$chosen_number

{ Ask the first party to deposit their funds into the contract. }
$first_party.deposit()

{ Ask the second party to deposit their funds into the contract. }
$second_party.deposit()

{ Ask the parties to choose a random number between 1 and 10 and store it in the chosen_number variable. }
$chosen_number = read_random_number(1, 10)

{ Generate a random number between 1 and 10 and store it in the winning_number variable. }
$winning_number = generate_random_number(1, 10)

{ Check if the chosen number matches the winning number. }
if($chosen_number == $winning_number) {

    { If they match, transfer the bet amount from the contract to the winning party. }
    $second_party.transfer($bet_amount)

} else {

    { Otherwise, keep the funds in the contract for a new bet. }
    $contract.deposit($bet_amount)
