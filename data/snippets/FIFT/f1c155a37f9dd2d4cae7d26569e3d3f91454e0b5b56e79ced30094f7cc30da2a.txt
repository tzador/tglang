;; This is a code snippet in FIFT (Functional Intermediate Form Tableau)

;; Define a function that takes in two arguments
(defn my-function [x y]
  ;; Print the sum of the two arguments
  (prn (+ x y))
  
  ;; Calculate the product of the two arguments
  (defn product [x y] (* x y))
  
  ;; Use the 'if' statement to check if the sum is greater than or equal to the product
  (if (>= (+ x y) (product x y))
  
    ;; If the condition is met, print a success message
    (prn "Sum is greater than or equal to product!")
    
    ;; If the condition is not met, print a failure message
    (prn "Sum is less than product :(")))
    
;; Call the function with arguments 5 and 10
(my-function 5 10)
