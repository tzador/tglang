--- An example FIFT code snippet ---
read  // reads an input from the user and stores it
    swap addr cr ld.  // swaps the top two elements on the stack, loads address onto stack and displays its contents
    dup 1 + swap  // duplicates the top stack element, adds 1 to it, then swaps it with the second element
    within            // checks if the top element is within the range [lower, upper] where lower and upper are the second and third element respectively
    "Input not within range, please try again." assert  // if the top element is not within the range, assert an error message
    dup "Input accepted: " swap strcat  // duplicates the top element, concatenates "Input accepted: " to it and swaps it with the second element
    disp        // displays the top element on the stack
