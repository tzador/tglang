(** This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number *)

(** Input: n - positive integer
Output: factorial of n - integer *)

(* Defining the factorial function *)
factorial(n) = (
    if n <= 1 then (
        return 1
    ) else (
        return n * factorial(n-1)
    )
)

(* Calling the factorial function with input 5 *)
result = factorial(5)

(** In FIFT, the function to print to the console is 'print'. Here we are printing the result *)
print("The factorial of 5 is ", result)
