;; This is a code snippet in Fift programming language that uses functional programming concepts
;; to generate a random number within a specified range.

;; Function that takes in an upper and a lower bound and generates a list of random numbers within that range

        ;; Map another random number to the range, to generate a list with different values

        (map n (+ lower-bound (* range n)))

;; Call the function with an upper bound of 10 and a lower bound of 1
