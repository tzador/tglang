// This code is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

: factorial ( n -- result ) // Takes input n and returns the factorial of n as result
  1 swap dup 1+ swap // Initializes i to 1 and copies it to the second value in the stack
  0 swap
  BEGIN // Start of loop
    OVER i * swap i 1+ swap
    DUP 0= // Check if current value is equal to n
  UNTIL ; // End of loop, terminate when n is reached
