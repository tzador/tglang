;; Sample code snippet in FIFT


;; Defining a function to find the maximum of two numbers
: max ( a b -- c ) \ Find the maximum of two numbers
    dup > (decision: is a > b?) 
    if 
        drop (if yes, drop a from stack)
    else 
        nip (if no, remove b from stack)
    then ;

The above code snippet defines a function called 'max' which takes in two numbers and returns the maximum of the two. It uses FIFT's conditional statements 'if' and 'else' to compare the two numbers and make a decision. The result is then returned using the 'then' keyword.
