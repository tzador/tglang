//This is a complex code snippet in FIFT
//It takes an array of numbers and finds the average of all the elements
//Annotation: FIFT (Fourth-generation assemBly Language for InterpreteT, pronounced "fifth") is an assembly language designed for the InterpreteT virtual machine. 
//It is used for developing smart contracts on the TON blockchain.

//Define a function to calculate the average
avg(numbers) {
  //Initialize variables
  let sum = 0 //Stores the sum of all elements
  let n = len(numbers) //Stores the length of the array

  //Loop through the array to calculate the sum
  for i in range(n) {
    sum += numbers[i] //Add current element to sum
  }

  //Calculate average by dividing sum by length of array
  let average = sum / n

  //Return the average
  return average
}

//Example input
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

//Call the avg function and print the result
let result = avg(numbers)
print("The average of the array is:", result)
