//Function for calculating the nth Fibonacci number
\ n2 n1 n 0
active{ //start active block
    n1 n_ //push n1 to stack
    dup n-1 n1 //push n-1 and n1 to stack
    active{ //start active block
        1+: n2 //add the top two elements and store in n2
    }active //end active block
    n n- //decrement n

nip n2 //remove n2 from stack
//Example call and output
5 0 1 fibn //calculate the 5th Fibonacci number
//Output: 5
