;; FIFT (Fift Is Fine Tool) is a programming language designed for smart contracts. 
;; It is associated with the Blockchain platform, Free TON, and was created by Telegram. 

;; This code snippet creates a function that checks if a given address is valid, based on the Free TON address format.

define isFreeTONAddress(address) {
  var isValid = 0
  var charSum = 0
  var addressLength = length(address)
  if (addressLength != 64) {
    print("Error! The address is not the correct length.")
    return false
  }
  for (var i = 0 i < addressLength i++) {
    charSum += charToNum(address[i])
  }
  if (charSum % 9 == 0) {
    isValid = 1
  }
  if (isValid) {
    print("The address is valid!")
    return true
  }
  else {
    print("Error! The address is not valid.")
    return false
  }
}

;; Description: This function takes in a string and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the address is valid.
;; Inputs:
