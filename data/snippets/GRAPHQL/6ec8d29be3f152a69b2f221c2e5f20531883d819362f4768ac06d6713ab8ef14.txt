// This code snippet uses GraphQL to query for multiple fields from the database. It retrieves all users and their associated posts and comments. Each field is annotated with comments to explain what type of data it returns. The syntax uses curly brackets to specify fields and uses indentation to show the relationships between different fields. Triple backticks are used to indicate the start and end of the code snippet.
