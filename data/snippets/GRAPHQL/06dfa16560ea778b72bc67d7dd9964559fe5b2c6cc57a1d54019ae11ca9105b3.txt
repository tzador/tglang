# This code snippet is a GraphQL query that searches for products based on a given query string, filters and sorting.

# The 'query' keyword is used to specify the operation, in this case, it is a 'SearchProducts' query.

# The inputs for the query are defined using variables, denoted by a '$' symbol. In this case, we have three variables:
# - $query of type String for the search query
# - $filters of type [ProductFilter!] for filtering the products
# - $sort of type ProductSort for sorting the products

# The main body of the query is enclosed within curly braces. Inside, we have a 'products' field, which takes in the aforementioned variables as arguments.
# Within the 'products' field, we specify the fields that we want to retrieve for each product.

# The 'pageInfo' field gives information about the pagination of the results, such as whether there are more pages, the start and end cursor, etc.

# The 'totalCount' field gives the total number of products that match the search criteria.

# Inside the 'edges' field, we specify the fields we want to retrieve for each product, along with a 'cursor' field for pagination purposes.

# In the 'node' field, we specify the specific fields we want to retrieve for each product, in this case, the id, title, description, price, tags, and images.

# The 'images' field uses the 'first' argument to specify that we only want to retrieve the first 5 images for each product. Within the nested 'edges' field, we specify the fields for each image, namely the id and url.

# This query is a comprehensive way to search for products with various filtering and pagination options, making it complex but powerful.
