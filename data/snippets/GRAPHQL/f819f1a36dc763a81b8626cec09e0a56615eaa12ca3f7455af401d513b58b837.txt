# This GraphQL query is used to get user information and the information of their followers. It takes in an ID as a parameter and returns the user's name, email, and address, as well as the name, email, and address of their 10 most recent followers. It also includes a cursor for pagination and a boolean value for whether there is a next page of followers.
