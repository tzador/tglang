# The above code snippet is a GraphQL query used to retrieve a specific user's information, along with their posts and comments.
# The "query" keyword indicates that this is a query operation, and "GetUser" is the name of the query.
# "($id: ID!)" is a parameter defined for the query, indicating that an ID is required to specify which user's information is being requested.
# "user(id: $id)" is the query field, indicating that the "user" object will be returned, with the specified ID from the parameter.
# Within the "user" object, the "id," "name," and "email" fields are requested.
# The "posts" field within the "user" object indicates that all posts by the specific user will be returned.
# Within each post, the "id," "title," and "body" fields are requested.
# The "comments" field within each post indicates that all comments on that post will also be returned.
# Within each comment, the "id" and "content" fields are requested.
# The exclamation mark after "ID" in the query parameter indicates that this field is non-nullable, meaning an ID must be provided for the query to run successfully.
