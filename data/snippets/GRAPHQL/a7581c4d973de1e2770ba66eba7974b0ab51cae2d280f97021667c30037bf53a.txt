// This query will retrieve the title, author's name, author's age, and number of pages of a book with an ID of 123.

// GraphQL offers a powerful way to retrieve specific data from a server without over-fetching or under-fetching.
// In the above query, we use the `query` keyword to indicate that we are performing a query operation.
// The `GetBook` after `query` is the name of our operation, which can be any valid identifier.
// Inside the curly braces, we specify the fields we want to retrieve from the `book` type.
// In this case, we specify the `title`, `author`, and `pages` fields.
// Notice that we can also access fields of nested types, such as the `name` and `age` fields of the `author` type.
// Finally, we pass in an argument `id` to specify the specific book we want to retrieve with a value of 123.
// This argument can be of any type, and GraphQL automatically resolves it for us.
