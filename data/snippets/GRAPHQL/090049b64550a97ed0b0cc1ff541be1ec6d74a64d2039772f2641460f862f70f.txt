""" 
      This is a GraphQL query that finds all users with a given status and their associated posts and comments.

      The query starts with the keyword 'query' followed by a unique identifier for the query, 'getUsersAndPosts'. 
      After the identifier, we specify the fields we want to retrieve for each user - their id, name, and status.
      Within each user field, we use the 'posts' and 'comments' arguments to specify that we want to retrieve 
      the associated posts and comments for that user. We also use the 'id', 'title', and 'content' arguments to 
      specify which fields we want to retrieve for each post, and the 'id' and 'text' arguments for comments.

      The 'filter' and 'orderBy' arguments allow us to filter and sort the results based on the posts' creation date.

      Overall, this GraphQL query allows us to efficiently retrieve data from multiple related entities in a single request.
