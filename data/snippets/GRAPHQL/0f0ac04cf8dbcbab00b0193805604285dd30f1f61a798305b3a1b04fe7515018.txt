// This query uses the `query` keyword to request data from the server.
// The name of the query is `GetUser`.
// It takes in one required parameter, `id`, of type `Int`.
// Inside the query, we call the `user` field, which returns the data for a specific user based on the id.
// In the curly braces, we specify the fields we want to retrieve for the user.
// These include `name`, `email`, and the nested fields `posts` and `comments` which have their own nested fields.
// This allows us to retrieve specific data from the user, including their posts and comments.
// To use the `id` parameter, we use the `$` symbol followed by the name of the parameter.

// Output:
