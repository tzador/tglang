type Query {
  person(id: ID): Person
  allPersons(last: Int): [Person!]!
}

/*
The Query type represents all of the possible queries that can be made within the GraphQL schema.

In this particular code snippet, we define the queries for retrieving a single person by their ID and retrieving all persons with the option to specify the number of results to return.

The ID type is a built-in scalar type in GraphQL, and the ID passed in to retrieve a single person must correspond to the ID field of that person in the objects returned in the [Person!] type.

The [Person!] type is a non-nullable list of Person objects. The "!" after the closing bracket ensures that the field will never be null.

Within the "person" query, the argument "id" is defined with type "ID". This means that when this query is used, it must include an ID argument to specify which person to retrieve.

Within the "allPersons" query, the argument "last" is defined with type "Int". This means that when this query is used, an optional "last" argument can be included to specify the number of results to return. If no argument is provided, the default value of "last" will be used.
