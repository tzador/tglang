// This is a query in GraphQL that will get the name, age, and friends' information of a specific user by using their ID.
// The query takes in a parameter of type ID, denoted by the "!" which represents a non-nullable type.
// This parameter is used to specify which user we want to retrieve information about.
// Inside the query, we have the "user" field which will return the requested information.
// Inside the "user" field, we specify the fields we want to get back, in this case, the name and age of the user.
// Additionally, we also want to get the name and age of the user's friends, denoted by the "friends" field.
// This field returns an array of friends, so we use the "[]" notation to specify that.
// Each friend object also has a "posts" field, which will return an array of posts created by that friend.
// Inside the "posts" field, we specify the "title" and "content" fields to get back.
// This query will return a complex nested object with information about the user, their friends, and their posts, all in one query.
