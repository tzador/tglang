/* This is a complex code snippet in CSS, using advanced selectors and multiple properties, and is used for creating a custom navigation menu */

/* First, let's create a class for our navigation menu and set its display property to flex to organize its items */
.nav-menu {
  display: flex;
}

/* Next, we'll select the list items inside the navigation menu and set their margin, padding, and font properties */
.nav-menu li {
  margin: 0 10px;
  padding: 10px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* To make the navigation menu more responsive, we'll add a media query to adjust the layout when the screen size is smaller than 600 pixels */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  /* Here, we'll change the display property of the navigation menu to block and add a background color to make it stand out */
  .nav-menu {
    display: block;
    background-color: #ccc;
  }

  /* We'll also set the list items to display as block elements and change their text alignment */
  .nav-menu li {
    display: block;
    text-align: center;
  }

  /* To give a different look to the active link, we'll target it and change its color and background color */
  .nav-menu li.active {
    color: white;
    background-color: #333;
  }
}

/* Finally, to make it more interesting, we'll add a hover effect to the list items */
.nav-menu li:hover {
  transform: rotate(10deg);
}
