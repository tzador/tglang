/* This code snippet demonstrates how to use CSS animation keyframes to create a bouncing effect on a button */

/* Target the button element with ID 'bounce' */
#bounce {
  /* Set initial position */
  position: relative;
  top: 0;
  /* Set animation duration and easing */
  animation: bounce 0.8s ease infinite;
}

/* Define the keyframes for the animation */
@keyframes bounce {
  /* Set starting point at 0% */
  0% {
    top: 0;
  }
  /* Set first bounce at 20% with a slight decrease in distance */
  20% {
    top: -20px;
  }
  /* Set the apex of the bounce at 40% */
  40% {
    top: 0;
  }
  /* Set second bounce at 60% with a larger decrease in distance */
  60% {
    top: -40px;
  }
  /* Set final position at 80% */
  80% {
    top: 0;
  }
}

/* Add hover effect for button to pause the animation */
#bounce:hover {
  animation-play-state: paused;
}
