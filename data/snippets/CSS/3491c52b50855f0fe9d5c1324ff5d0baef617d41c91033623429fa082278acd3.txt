/* This is a CSS code snippet that creates a complex gradient background using linear gradients */
background: linear-gradient(45deg, #FF5CAB 0%, #FF5CAB 10%, #194B9D 10%, #194B9D 20%, #FF355E 20%, #FF355E 30%, #FFA07A 30%, #FFA07A 40%, #3399FF 40%, #3399FF 50%, #66FF33 50%, #66FF33 60%, #FFDD22 60%, #FFDD22 70%, #191970 70%, #191970 80%, #8B0000 80%, #8B0000 90%, #FFF8DC 90%, #FFF8DC 100%);
/*
This code creates a linear gradient with 45 degrees angle. The first color starts at 0% of the width and is set to #FF5CAB. 
The second color starts at 10% of the width and is set to #FF5CAB. 
The third color starts at 10% of the width and is set to #194B9D. 
The fourth color starts at 20% of the width and is set to #194B9D.
And so on until the last color which starts at 100% of the width and is set to #FFF8DC. 
The result is a complex gradient background with multiple colors blending into each other at various points.
