/* Annotated CSS code snippet */

/* This is a complex CSS code snippet that uses box-shadow to create a visually interesting background for a page element. */

/* First, we select the element with the class "box" */

.box {
  /* Then we give it a fixed width and height to establish its size on the page */
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  
  /* Next, we establish the box-shadow properties to create the desired effect. 
  The horizontal and vertical offsets are set to 0px, so the shadow will be directly behind the element.
  The blur radius is set to 20px, giving the shadow a soft, blurred edge.
  The spread radius is set to -10px, creating a cut-out effect around the edges of the element.
  The color of the shadow is set to a deep blue (#040329).
  The multiple shadows are separated by a comma. */
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px -10px #040329,
  /* For a more dynamic effect, we add an additional shadow with a slight offset and a lighter color (#6f6c92). This will create a subtle glow around the edges. */
  	   0px 0px 10px -5px #6f6c92;
}

/* Lastly, we add a linear gradient background to the element, using the same colors as the box-shadow to create a seamless transition from shadow to background. */
.box {
  background: linear-gradient(#040329, #6f6c92);
}
