/* This is a complex code snippet showcasing CSS animations and media queries. */

p {
  font-size: 16px;
}

@keyframes slide {
  0% {transform: translateX(0);}
  100% {transform: translateX(200px);}
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  p {
    font-size: 12px;
  }
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 400px) {
  p {
    font-size: 10px;
    animation: slide 2s ease infinite;
  }
}

/* The above code sets the default font size for paragraphs to 16px.
It also defines a keyframe animation called 'slide' that moves the element 200px to the right.
The animation is triggered when the screen size is less than 400px, and is set to loop infinitely.
The second media query sets the font size to 12px for screens with a maximum width of 600px.
This ensures that the text remains legible on smaller devices. */
