/* Explanation:
 This code snippet is written in C#. It defines a method called "Fibonacci" which takes in an integer parameter 'n', representing the position of the desired number in the Fibonacci sequence. The method uses recursion to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

The first part of the snippet is an XML comment that provides information about the method and its parameters. This is used for documentation and helps other developers understand the purpose of the method.

Next, the method checks for two base cases - if n is equal to 0 or 1, then the method returns 0 and 1 respectively. These are the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

If neither of the base cases are met, then the method uses recursion to call itself twice, with n-1 and n-2 as parameters. This continues until the base cases are met and then the final Fibonacci number is calculated.

The code snippet ends with a closing curly brace.*/
