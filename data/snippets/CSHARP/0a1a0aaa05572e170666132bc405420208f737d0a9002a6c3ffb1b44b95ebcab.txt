//Output:
//This code snippet includes two methods - CalculateArea and IsPrime
//CalculateArea takes in a double radius and calculates the area of a circle using Math.PI constant and Math.Pow method
//IsPrime takes in an integer number and checks if it is a prime number by iterating through numbers from 2 up to number-1 and checking for factors. 
//The first method has a return type of double and the second method has a return type of bool.
