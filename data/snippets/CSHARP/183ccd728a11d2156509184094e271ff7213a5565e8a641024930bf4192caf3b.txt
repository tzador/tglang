// This is a complex function that takes in an array of integers and returns the average value
public double Average(int[] numbers)
{
    // first, we need to initialize a variable to hold the sum of all the numbers
    int sum = 0;
    // then, we loop through the array and add each number to the sum
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++)
    {
        sum += numbers[i];
    }

    // next, we need to calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total number of elements in the array
    double average = (double)sum / numbers.Length;

    // finally, we return the average value
    return average;
}

// Example usage: 
int[] nums = { 5, 10, 15, 20 };
double avg = Average(nums);
Console.WriteLine($"The average of the numbers is: {avg}");

// Expected output: The average of the numbers is: 12.5
