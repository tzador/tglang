//This code snippet uses the LINQ query syntax to filter and sort a list

var fruitList = new List<string>{"apple", "banana", "orange", "pineapple", "strawberry", "mango", "kiwi"};

var filteredList = from fruit in fruitList //starting the LINQ query
                   where fruit.Contains("a") //filtering fruits that contain the letter "a"
                   orderby fruit.Length descending //sorting the fruits by their length in descending order
                   select fruit; //selecting only the fruits that meet the criteria

foreach(var fruit in filteredList) //looping through the filtered list
{
    Console.WriteLine(fruit); //printing each fruit to the console
}

//Output:
//pineapple
//orange
//banana
//apple
