/*This program calculates the average of three numbers*/

//Create variables for each number and initialize them with values
int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 20;
int num3 = 30;

//Calculate the sum of the three numbers
int sum = num1 + num2 + num3;

//Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total number of numbers (3)
double average = sum / 3.0;

//Print the average to the console
Console.WriteLine("The average of the three numbers is: " + average);

/* Output:
