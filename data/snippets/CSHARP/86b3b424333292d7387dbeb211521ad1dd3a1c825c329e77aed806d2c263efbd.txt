//This code snippet demonstrates how to implement nested classes in C#
//The outer class is called "Person" and has a nested class called "Address"
//The nested class contains information about the person's address
public class Person
{
    //class properties
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public Address Address { get; set; }

    //constructor
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.Age = age;
    }

    //nested class
    public class Address
    {
        //class properties
        public string Street { get; set; }
        public string City { get; set; }
        public string State { get; set; }

        //constructor
        public Address(string street, string city, string state)
        {
            this.Street = street;
            this.City = city;
            this.State = state;
        }
    }
}

//code that creates an instance of the Person class and sets information for the nested "Address" class
Person person = new Person("John Smith", 30);
person.Address = new Person.Address("123 Main Street", "New York", "NY");
