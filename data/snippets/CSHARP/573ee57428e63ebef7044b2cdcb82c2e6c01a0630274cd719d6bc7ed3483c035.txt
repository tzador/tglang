// This code snippet is a C# program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion
// First, we create a static class called FactorialCalculator
public static class FactorialCalculator
{
    // Next, we create a public static method called Calculate that takes in an integer parameter
    // This method will use recursion to calculate the factorial value
    public static int Calculate(int number)
    {
        // The base case for the recursion is when the number is either 0 or 1
        if (number == 0 || number == 1)
        {
            // Return 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
            return 1;
        }
        else
        {
            // If the number is greater than 1, we call the Calculate method recursively
            // We multiply the number by the factorial value of the number minus 1
            return number * Calculate(number - 1);
        }
    }
}

// Now, we can call the Calculate method in our main program and pass in an integer value to calculate the factorial
// In this example, we will calculate the factorial of 5
int factorialValue = FactorialCalculator.Calculate(5);

// We can then print the result
Console.WriteLine($"Factorial of 5 is: {factorialValue}");
