// This code snippet is a method that calculates the factorial of a given number(recursively)
// It takes in an integer as a parameter and returns the factorial of that number as an integer
// The method uses a basic if statement and a recursive call to itself to calculate the factorial
public int CalculateFactorial(int num)

        return num * CalculateFactorial(num - 1); // recursive call to itself
    }
}

// Calling the CalculateFactorial method with a given number and printing the result
int result = CalculateFactorial(5);
Console.WriteLine("The factorial of 5 is: " + result); // output: The factorial of 5 is: 120
