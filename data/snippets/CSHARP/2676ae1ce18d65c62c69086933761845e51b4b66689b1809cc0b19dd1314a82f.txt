//This code snippet creates a class in C# called "Calculator"

        result = num1 + num2;

        //Returns the result
        return result;

//Example usage of the "Calculator" class
//Creates a new instance of the "Calculator" class
Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

//Calls the "Add" method and passes in two integers, then assigns the result to a variable
int sum = calculator.Add(5, 3);

//Prints out the result to the console
Console.WriteLine(sum); //Output: 8

//Calls the "Subtract" method and passes in two integers, then assigns the result to a variable
int difference = calculator.Subtract(10, 5);

//Prints out the result to the console
Console.WriteLine(difference); //Output: 5

//Calls the "Multiply" method and passes in two integers, then assigns the result to a variable
int product = calculator.Multiply(2, 4);

//Prints out the result to the console
Console.WriteLine(product); //Output: 8

//Calls the "Divide" method and passes in two integers, then assigns the result to a variable
int quotient = calculator.Divide(10, 2);

//Prints out the result to the console
Console.WriteLine(quotient); //Output: 5
