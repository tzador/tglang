// This is a code snippet that calculates the average score of students in a class

// Declare an integer variable to hold the total score
int totalScore = 0;

// Declare an integer variable to hold the number of students
int numStudents = 0;

// Use a for loop to iterate through each student's score
for (int i = 0; i < numStudents; i++)
{
    // Ask for the student's score and convert it to an integer
    Console.Write("Enter student's score: ");
    int score = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

    // Add the score to the total score
    totalScore += score;
}

// Calculate the average by dividing the total score by the number of students
double average = totalScore / numStudents;

// Print out the average score
Console.WriteLine($"The average score of the class is: {average}");
