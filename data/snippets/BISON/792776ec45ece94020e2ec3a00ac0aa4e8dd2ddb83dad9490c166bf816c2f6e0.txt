/*
    This is a simple BISON program that reads a list of numbers separated by spaces or tabs and calculates the sum of the numbers.
    To run this program, you will need to compile it with a C compiler and include the BISON library.
    Here is an example of input and output:
    Input: 1 2 3 4 5
    Output: The sum of the numbers is: 15
