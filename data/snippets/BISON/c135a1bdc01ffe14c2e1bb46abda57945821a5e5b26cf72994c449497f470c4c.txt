Important notes: This code snippet is written in the programming language BISON, which is a parser generator that is used to generate parsers for context-free grammars. 

The first section of this code snippet is the definition section, where the token types are declared. Tokens are the basic units of BISON, and they can represent different types of data such as integers, characters, strings, floats, booleans, instances, classes, and objects. 

Next is the rules section, where the grammar rules for parsing the input are defined. Here, there are rules for different types of expressions and for creating instances of classes and objects. 

After that, there is a section for function declarations. In this case, there is a function called "execute" that takes an instance_declaration and executes it. 

Finally, there is the main function, which uses the defined classes and rules to create and execute an expression and its corresponding instance_declaration. The output will be the value of the expression, which is 5 in this case. 

Note that this is a simplified example and does not include all possible rules and functions that can be defined in BISON. This code is meant to demonstrate the basic structure and functionality of BISON code.
