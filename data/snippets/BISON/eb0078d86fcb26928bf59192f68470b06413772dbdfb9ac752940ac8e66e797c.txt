//This code snippet is written in BISON (a parser generator) and it defines the tokens DIGIT and LETTER. It also sets the precedence of operators using the %right and %left directives.
//The input rule takes in an expression and prints the result using the printf function.
//The expression rule defines the different operations that can be performed on factors.
//The factor rule specifies the different types of factors that can be used in an expression, such as digits, letters, or sub-expressions in parentheses.
//The %% at the end denotes the end of the BISON code.
//Note: This code snippet is for example purposes only and may not be a complete or functional code.

//To use this code, a lexer program would be needed to tokenize the input, and then the BISON-generated parser would handle the parsing and operations. This snippet is just one small part of a larger program that would handle mathematical expressions.
