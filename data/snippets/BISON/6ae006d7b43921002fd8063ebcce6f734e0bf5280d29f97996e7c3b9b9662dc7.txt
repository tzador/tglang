// Definition of a grammar rule in BISON
// This rule matches a mathematical expression involving addition and multiplication

expr: expr '+' term       { $$ = $1 + $3; } // handles addition
    | expr '*' term       { $$ = $1 * $3; } // handles multiplication
    | term                { $$ = $1; }      // base case, just returns the term on its own
    ;

term: number              { $$ = $1; } // a term can simply be a number
    | '(' expr ')'        { $$ = $2; } // or it can be an expression surrounded by parentheses, in which case we just use the value of the expression as the term
    ;

number: /[0-9]+/          { $$ = atoi($1); } // matches a sequence of digits and converts it to an integer
    ;
