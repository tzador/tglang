statement: PRINT | ASSIGN | FUNCTION_CALL;

//An expression list is used when calling a function, it contains multiple expressions

//Below are the lexical definitions, used to define the tokens in the program
//These are the basic building blocks of the grammar rules
ID: [a-z]+; //An identifier starts with a lowercase letter and can contain multiple lowercase letters
VARIABLE: [a-z]+; //Same as above, as variable names are also identifiers
INTEGER: [0-9]+; //An integer can contain one or more digits
FLOAT: [0-9]*('.'[0-9]+)?; //A float can either be a whole number or a decimal number
OPERATOR: '+' | '-' | '*' | '/'; //These are the basic arithmetic operators

//Finally, we define the parts of the language that are ignored, such as whitespace and comments
%ignore " "; //Ignore spaces
%ignore "\n"; //Ignore new lines
%ignore "//.*"; //Ignore comments starting with //
