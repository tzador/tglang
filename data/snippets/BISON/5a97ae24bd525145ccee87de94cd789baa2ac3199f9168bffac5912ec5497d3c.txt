In this snippet, we are using the BISON programming language to create a parser for arithmetic expressions. BISON is a parser generator that is used to generate a parser based on a grammar specification. Let's break down the code to understand it better:

1. The first line includes a `%{ %}` block, which is used to declare global variables and define functions that will be used in the grammar rules.

2. The next line declares a non-terminal symbol called `start`. It is defined as an `exp` followed by a `NEWLINE`. The action specified after the `{}` block assigns the value of `exp` to the `total` variable.

3. The `exp` rule is a recursive rule that defines arithmetic expressions. It can be understood as follows:
	- If the expression is of the form `exp PLUS exp`, the action in the block calculates the sum of the two expressions and assigns it to `$$`.
	- Similarly, for `MINUS`, `TIMES`, `DIVIDE` operations, the corresponding actions perform the arithmetic operation and assign the result to `$$`.
	- If the expression is just an `INT`, the action converts the integer value of the token into an integer and assigns it to `$$`.
	- The rule also supports parenthesis for grouping the expressions. The action for this extracts the value of the expression inside the parenthesis and assigns it to `$$`.

4. The next two lines declare the precedence for the `ELSE` and `THEN` symbols. This is done using the `%nonassoc` directive, which means that these symbols are not associative and will be treated as separate symbols in the grammar rules.

5. Finally, the `%%` line separates the grammar rules from the C code that will perform the actions specified in the rules.

6. In this code snippet, we have not specified any C code, so the parser generated using this grammar will simply calculate the value of arithmetic expressions and store it in the `total` variable.
