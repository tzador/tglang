; A complex code snippet in Assembly language 
; This program prints the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence

; Initialize the first two terms of the sequence
    MOV AX, 0 ; First term = 0
    MOV BX, 1 ; Second term = 1

    ; Loop for printing the first 10 terms
    MOV CX, 10 ; Setting loop counter to 10

    START: ; Beginning of the loop
        ADD AX, BX ; Add the first two terms to get the next term
        MOV DX, AX ; Store the result in DX
        MOV AH, 2 ; Function to print a character
        INT 21H ; System call to print character in AX
        MOV AH, 9 ; Function to print a string
        LEA DX, MSG ; Load address of string to be printed
        INT 21H ; System call to print string in DX
        MOV AH, 2 ; Function to print a character
        MOV DL, ',' ; Comma to separate terms
        INT 21H ; System call to print character in DL
        MOV AH, 2 ; Function to print a character
        MOV DL, ' ' ; Space to separate terms
        INT 21H ; System call to print character in DL
        MOV AX, BX ; Second term becomes the first term for the next loop
        MOV BX, DX ; Result stored in DX becomes the second term
        LOOP START ; Repeat loop until CX (loop counter) = 0

    ; End of program
    MOV AH, 4CH ; Function to terminate program
    INT 21H ; System call to end program

    ; String to be printed
    MSG DB 'FIB:', 0AH, 0DH, ' $'
