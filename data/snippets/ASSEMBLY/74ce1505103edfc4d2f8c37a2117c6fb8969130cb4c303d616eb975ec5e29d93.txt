  ;Function to calculate the factorial of a number
  factorial:
  ;Move the number to calculate into ebx
  mov ebx, eax
  
  ;Check if the number is less than or equal to 1
  cmp ebx, 1
  jle end_factorial
  
  ;If the number is greater than 1, continue with the factorial calculation
  ;Initialize ecx to 1
  mov ecx, 1
  
  ;Loop to multiply ecx with each number from 2 to the given number
  loop:
  ;Multiply ecx with ebx
  mul ebx
  
  ;Decrement ebx to get the next number in the loop
  dec ebx
  
  ;Check if ebx is greater than 1, if yes, repeat the loop
  cmp ebx, 1
  jg loop
  
  ;Check if ebx is equal to 1, if yes, multiply ecx with 1 to get the final result
  cmp ebx, 1
  je loop
  
  ;Final result is stored in eax
  end_factorial:
  mov eax, ecx
  
  ;Return to the calling function
