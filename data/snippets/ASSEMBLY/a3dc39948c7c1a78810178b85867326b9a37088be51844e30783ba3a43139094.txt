; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion
; Input: Number to calculate factorial of (stored in R0)
; Output: Factorial value (stored in R1)

    MOV R1, #1 ; Initialize R1 to 1

recursion:
    CMP R0, #0 ; Compare R0 with 0
    BEQ end_recursion ; If R0 is 0, end recursion
    
    MUL R1, R1, R0 ; R1 = R1*R0 (Multiply R0 with R1 and store result in R1)
    SUB R0, R0, #1 ; R0 = R0 - 1 (Decrement R0 by 1)
    BL recursion ; Branch to recursion label (loop)
    
end_recursion:
    ; Factorial value is stored in R1, return to main routine
    BX LR ; Branch and exchange instruction (return to main routine)
