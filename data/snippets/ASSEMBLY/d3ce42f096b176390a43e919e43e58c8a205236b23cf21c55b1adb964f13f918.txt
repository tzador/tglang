; This code snippet converts a decimal number in a memory location to ASCII characters and
; stores them in another memory location

; Initialize registers
mov ax, [source] ; Load decimal number from source memory location into AX register
mov bx, [destination] ; Load destination memory location into BX register
mov cx, 10 ; Initialize CX register to 10 for division

loop: ; Start a loop to divide the decimal number by 10
div cx ; Divide the decimal number in AX by 10, quotient will be stored in AX and remainder in DX
add dl, '0' ; Convert remainder to ASCII character by adding '0'
mov [bx], dl ; Store ASCII character in destination memory location
inc bx ; Increase destination memory location by 1
cmp ax, 0 ; Check if AX register is equal to 0 after division
jne loop ; If not equal to 0, loop back to divide again

mov [bx], '$' ; Add '$' character at the end of the string to terminate it
ret ; Return from subroutine

; Data section
source dw 12345 ; Decimal number to be converted
destination db 6 dup(?) ; Destination memory location for storing ASCII characters
