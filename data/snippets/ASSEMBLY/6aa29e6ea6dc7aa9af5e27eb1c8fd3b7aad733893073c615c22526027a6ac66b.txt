; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
; The input is provided through the `eax` register and the result is stored in the `ebx` register

section .text ; Defines a section for the code

global _start ; Marks the entry point of the program

_start: ; Start of the program
    mov ebx, 1 ; Sets the initial value of ebx to 1
    mov ecx, eax ; Move the input value to the ecx register for calculations
    cmp eax, 1 ; Compare the input value with 1
    jle end ; If less than or equal to 1, jump to the end of the program

loop: ; Loop to calculate the factorial
    dec ecx ; Decrement the value in ecx by 1
    mul ebx ; Multiply the current value of ebx to the value in ecx
    cmp ecx, 1 ; Compare the value in ecx with 1
    jg loop ; If greater than 1, continue the loop
    jmp end ; Jump to the end of the program when the loop is finished

end:
    mov ebx, eax ; Move the calculated value from eax to ebx for output
    mov eax, 1 ; Set the exit code to 1
    int 0x80 ; System call to exit the program
