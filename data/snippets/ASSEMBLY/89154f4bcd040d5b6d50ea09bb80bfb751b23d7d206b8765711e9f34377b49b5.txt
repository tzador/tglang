Function CalculateSum(input1, input2)
;This function takes two inputs and calculates the sum of them
;Input1 and Input2 are 32-bit signed integers

    PUSH EBP ;Push the base pointer onto the stack
    MOV EBP, ESP ;Move the stack pointer into the base pointer
    SUB ESP, 8 ;Allocate space on the stack for the input parameters

    ;Save the input parameters on the stack
    MOV DWORD PTR [EBP - 4], input1 ;Move the first input into the memory location referenced by the base pointer - 4
    MOV DWORD PTR [EBP - 8], input2 ;Move the second input into the memory location referenced by the base pointer - 8

    ;Perform the addition
    MOV EAX, [EBP - 4] ;Move input1 into the accumulator
    ADD EAX, [EBP - 8] ;Add input2 to the accumulator
    MOV [EBP - 4], EAX ;Move the result back into the memory location referenced by the base pointer - 4

    ;Clean up the stack
    MOV ESP, EBP ;Move the stack pointer back to the base pointer
    POP EBP ;Pop the base pointer off the stack
    RET ;Return to the calling function
