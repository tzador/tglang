section .data  ; defines the data section where constants and variables can be declared

msg db 'Hello, world!', 0xa, 0xd ; defines a string constant with a newline and carriage return

section .text  ; defines the text section where code instructions are written

global _start  ; declares the entry point of the program

_start:
mov rax, 1    ; moves the value 1 into the accumulator register, which is used for system calls
mov rdi, 1    ; moves the value 1 into the destination register, which is used for printing
mov rsi, msg  ; moves the address of the string constant into the source register
mov rdx, 14   ; moves the length of the string constant into the length register
syscall       ; performs a system call, which in this case, prints the string to the console

mov rax, 60   ; moves the value 60 into the accumulator register, which is used for system calls
xor rdi, rdi  ; clears the destination register
syscall       ; performs a system call, which exits the program
