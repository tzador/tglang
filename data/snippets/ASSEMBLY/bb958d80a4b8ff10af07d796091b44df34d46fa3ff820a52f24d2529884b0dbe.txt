; This code snippet demonstrates a simple assembly program that performs
; addition of two numbers and stores the result in a register
; Register A holds the first number, Register B holds the second number,
; and Register C will store the result

; Define the starting address of the program
START:
    ; Initialize the registers
    LDA #10         ; Load the value 10 into Register A
    LDB #5          ; Load the value 5 into Register B

    ; Perform the addition
    ADD A, B        ; Add Register A and Register B and store the result in the accumulator
    STA C           ; Store the accumulator value in Register C

    ; Print the result
    LDX #C          ; Load the memory address of Register C into index register X
    LDY #1          ; Load the length of the data to print into index register Y
    LDZ #SYSOUT     ; Load the system output interrupt number into index register Z
    INT             ; Call the system output function

    ; End the program
    END START       ; Label the end of the program and specify the starting address
