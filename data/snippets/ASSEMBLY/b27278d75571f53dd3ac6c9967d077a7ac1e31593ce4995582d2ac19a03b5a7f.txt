; This code snippet calculates the sum of two numbers and stores the result in a variable
 mov R1, #32 ; Move the first number, 32, into the R1 register
 mov R2, #48 ; Move the second number, 48, into the R2 register
 add R3, R1, R2 ; Add the contents of R1 and R2 and store the result in the R3 register

; Example code snippet in ARM Assembly to calculate the sum of two numbers and store the result in a variable
; Load the first number, 32, into the R1 register
; Load the second number, 48, into the R2 register
; Add the contents of R1 and R2 and store the result in the R3 register
; Output: 80
