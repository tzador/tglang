; This code snippet is written in Assembly language.
; It creates a simple program that calculates the factorial of a given number.

section .text ; Indicates the start of the code section

global _start ; Makes the main entry point of the program the label '_start'

_start: ; The main entry point of the program

; -------------------------- Initializing variables ---------------------------

mov ecx, 5 ; Sets the value of the number whose factorial is to be calculated
mov eax, 1 ; Initializes the accumulator with the value 1
mov ebx, 1 ; Initializes the counter with the value 1

; ---------------------------- Calculating factorial --------------------------

; The loop will keep multiplying the value in eax with ebx until ebx is equal to the
; given number. Once ebx is equal to the given number, the loop will terminate.

loop_start:
mul ebx ; Multiply the accumulator with the counter
inc ebx ; Increment the counter by 1
cmp ebx, ecx ; Compare the counter with the given number
jne loop_start ; Jump to loop_start if they are not equal
jmp end ; Jump to the end of the program once the factorial is calculated

; ------------------------------ Printing result ------------------------------

end:
; The result of the factorial is stored in the accumulator (eax).
; To print it, we need to move it to the 'ebx' register and use the 'mov' system call.

mov ebx, eax ; Move the result to ebx for printing
mov eax, 1 ; Move the 'write' system call to eax
int 0x80 ; Call the kernel to perform the system call
mov eax, 0 ; Move the 'exit' system call to eax
int 0x80 ; Call the kernel to perform the system call

; ------------------------------- End of program ------------------------------

section .data ; Indicates the start of the data section

; No data needs to be stored for this simple program, so this section is empty.
