; Here is a code snippet that initializes a string variable and performs a loop on each character in the string
; The string variable is called "message" and its value is "Hello World!"

; Initialize the string variable
message db "Hello World!",0

; Set counter variable to 0
mov cx, 0

; Move address of string variable into SI register
mov si, offset message

; Loop through each character in the string
next_char:
; Move character at address pointed by SI register into AL register
mov al, [si]
; Check if character is null terminator
cmp al, 0
jz end
; Perform desired actions on character here
; Increment counter variable
inc cx
; Move to next character in string by incrementing SI register
inc si
jmp next_char

; End of loop
end:
; Print out value of counter variable
mov ah, 09h
mov dx, cx
int 21h
