; This code snippet is an assembly program that calculates the factorial of a given number
; Input: The number whose factorial is to be calculated is stored in the AX register
; Output: The factorial of the given number is stored in the AX register
; Register usage: AX - stores the factorial of the given number
; BX - stores the counter, initially set to 1
; CX - stores the current value to be multiplied with the factorial
; DX - stores a temporary value used for multiplication

.code
    mov bx, 1 ; initialize BX to 1
    mov cx, ax ; move the given number to CX
    mov ax, 1 ; initialize AX to 1 for multiplication
factLoop:
    mul cx ; multiply AX and CX and store the result in AX
    inc bx ; increment BX to keep track of the number of multiplications
    cmp bx, cx ; compare BX with CX
    jne factLoop ; jump back to factLoop if BX is not equal to CX
    ; once the loop ends, the factorial of the given number will be stored in the AX register
