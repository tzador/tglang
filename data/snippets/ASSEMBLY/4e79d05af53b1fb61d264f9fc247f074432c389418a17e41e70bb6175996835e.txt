;This code snippet is a subroutine that calculates the factorial of a given number n

	n:	.DWORD		;input value n, stored in DWORD (32 bits)

	factorial: ;begin subroutine

	xor eax, eax ;clear EAX register

	mov ebx, 1 ;initialize EBX register to 1, which will be used as a counter

loop_start:
	mul ebx ;multiply EAX by current value of EBX
	inc ebx ;increment EBX by 1
	cmp ebx, n ;compare EBX to input value n
	jne loop_start ;repeat loop until EBX reaches n

	ret ;return to main program with result stored in EAX

;variable n must be defined and stored in DWORD format before calling this subroutine
