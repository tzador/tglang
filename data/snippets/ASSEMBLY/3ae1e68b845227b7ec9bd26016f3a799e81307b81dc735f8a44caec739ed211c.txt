; This is a code snippet that calculates the sum of two numbers in assembly language

; Setup variables
sum DB 0 ; variable to hold the sum of the two numbers
num1 DB 10 ; first number
num2 DB 20 ; second number

section .text
global _start ; program entry point

_start:
; Move the first number into the AL register
mov al, [num1]
; Move the second number into the BL register
mov bl, [num2]
; Add the two numbers and store the result in the sum variable
add al, bl
mov [sum], al

; Move the sum into the AX register
mov ax, [sum]

; Convert the sum into ASCII and store it in the sum variable
add ax, 30h ; 30h is the ASCII code for '0'
mov [sum], ax

; Move the sum variable into the AH register
mov ah, 2 ; set the interrupt number for printing
int 21h ; print the sum

; Exit the program
mov ah, 0 ; set the interrupt number for program termination
int 21h ; terminate the program

; End of program
