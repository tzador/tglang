start:

	mov ax, @data 		; Set data segment register
	mov ds, ax

	mov ax, begin_word	; Load first number in sequence into ax 

for_loop:
	cmp ax, end_word	; Compare ax to end word to see if end of sequence has been reached
	je end_for_loop		; If equal, jump to end_for_loop

	mul ax				; Multiply ax by itself (ax * ax)
	add sum, ax			; Add result to sum variable

	inc ax				; Increment ax by 1 to move to next number in sequence
	jmp for_loop		; Jump back to beginning of for_loop to continue iterating

end_for_loop:
	mov ax, sum			; Move sum variable into ax

; End of program
	mov ah, 0 			; Store exit code of 0 in ah register
	int 20h				; Call interrupt to exit program

end start    			; End program and set entry point to start label 

; Result will be 385 (1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100)
