; This code snippet is written in Assembly Language
; It multiplies two 32-bit integers and stores the result in a variable named "product"
; Inputs: 32-bit integer stored in register eax, 32-bit integer stored in register ebx
; Output: 32-bit integer stored in variable "product" at memory address 1000h

global _start	; entry point for program

_start:
	mov eax, 5	; move first integer to eax
	mov ebx, 3	; move second integer to ebx
	mul ebx		; multiply eax and ebx
	mov DWORD [1000h], eax	; store result in variable "product"

section .data
