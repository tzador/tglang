;; This code snippet multiplies two numbers and stores the result in a register

;; Define variables
num1 DB 10 ;; single byte variable to hold the first number
num2 DB 5  ;; single byte variable to hold the second number
result RESB 1 ;; reserve a single byte for the result

;; Load the first number into a register
MOV AL, num1

;; Multiply the first number by the second number
MUL num2

;; Store the result in the designated register
MOV result, AL

;; Print the result
PUTS "The result is:"

;; Display the result using a system call
LEA RDI, [result] ;; load the address of the result
MOV RSI, result ;; move the value of the result into RSI
MOV RDX, 1 ;; set the length of the result to 1 byte
MOV RAX, 1 ;; select the write system call
SYSCALL     ;; execute the system call
