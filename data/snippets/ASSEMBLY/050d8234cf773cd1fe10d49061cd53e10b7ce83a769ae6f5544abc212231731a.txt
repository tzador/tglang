; This code snippet is written in x86 Assembly language
; It takes in two numbers from the user and adds them together

; Asking for first number
mov ah, 01h         ; Set input mode to read character
int 21h             ; Interrupt 21h to read input from user
sub al, 30h         ; Convert ASCII character to decimal
mov bl, al          ; Save input to register bl

; Asking for second number
mov ah, 01h         ; Set input mode to read character
int 21h             ; Interrupt 21h to read input from user
sub al, 30h         ; Convert ASCII character to decimal

; Adding first and second number
add bl, al          ; Add registers bl and al
add bl, 30h         ; Convert decimal back to ASCII character

; Printing result
mov ah, 02h         ; Set output mode to print character
mov dl, bl          ; Move result to dl register
int 21h             ; Interrupt 21h to print result

ret                 ; End of code
