LDA #0 ; Load 0 into accumulator

LDY #0 ; Load 0 into Y register

; Set the first 8-bit number in memory location 0x1000
LDA #0xAA ; Load 0xAA into accumulator
STA $1000 ; Store accumulator value at memory location 0x1000

; Set the second 8-bit number in memory location 0x1001
LDA #0x55 ; Load 0x55 into accumulator
STA $1001 ; Store accumulator value at memory location 0x1001

; Multiply first and second number by looping through the
; second number and adding it to the first number in each iteration

LOOP:
LDA $1000 ; Load first number into accumulator
CLC ; Clear carry flag
ADC $1001 ; Add second number to accumulator (with carry)
TAX ; Transfer accumulator value to X register
INY ; Increment Y register to keep track of iterations
CPY #8 ; Compare Y register to 8 (the number of bits in an 8-bit number)
BNE LOOP ; If Y register is not equal to 8, repeat loop

; The result is stored in the A and X registers
; Shift the result in the X register 8 bits to the left
ASL X ; Left shift X register by 1 bit
ASL X ; Left shift X register by 1 bit
ASL X ; Left shift X register by 1 bit
ASL X ; Left shift X register by 1 bit
ASL X ; Left shift X register by 1 bit
ASL X ; Left shift X register by 1 bit
ASL X ; Left shift X register by 1 bit
ASL X ; Left shift X register by 1 bit

; Add the result in the X register to the A register
CLC ; Clear carry flag
ADC X ; Add X register value to accumulator (with carry)
STA $2000 ; Store the final result in memory location 0x2000

; The A register now holds the first 8 bits of the result
; The X register now holds the last 8 bits of the result
