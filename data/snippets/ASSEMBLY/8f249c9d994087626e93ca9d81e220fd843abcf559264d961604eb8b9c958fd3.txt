; This code snippet calculates the average of two numbers and stores the result in a variable

.section .data
NUM1 dd 5; first number
NUM2 dd 10; second number
AVG dd ?; variable to store average value

.section .text
global _start ;the entry point for the program

_start:

; load the values of NUM1 and NUM2 into registers EAX and EBX
mov eax, [NUM1]
mov ebx, [NUM2]

; calculate the sum of the two numbers and store in EAX
add eax, ebx

; divide the sum by 2 to get the average and store in EAX
mov ecx, 2 ; load the divisor into register ECX
div ecx ; divide EAX by ECX, quotient stored in EAX, remainder in EDX

; move the value in EAX to the AVG variable
mov [AVG], eax

; exit the program
mov eax, 1 ; load the exit system call number into register EAX
xor ebx, ebx ; clear EBX register
int 0x80 ; call the Linux system call to exit the program
