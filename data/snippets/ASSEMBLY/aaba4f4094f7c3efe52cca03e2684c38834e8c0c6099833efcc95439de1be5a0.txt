; This is a simple arithmetic program in assembly
;
; It takes two integers from user input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

; Data segment
.data

;Variables to store user input
num1 db ?
num2 db ?

;Variables to store calculations
sum db ?
difference db ?
product db ?
quotient db ?

; Code segment

;Starting point of the program
main proc
    
    ;Read first number from user
    mov ah, 01h  ;Set function code for reading character from input
    int 21h      ;Call interrupt 21h to read character from input
    sub al, 30h  ;Convert ASCII character to number 
    mov num1, al ;Store number in variable num1

    ;Read second number from user
    mov ah, 01h  ;Set function code for reading character from input
    int 21h      ;Call interrupt 21h to read character from input
    sub al, 30h  ;Convert ASCII character to number
    mov num2, al ;Store number in variable num2

    ;Calculate sum and store in variable sum
    mov al, num1 ;Move first number into AL register
    add al, num2 ;Add second number to AL register
    mov sum, al  ;Store sum in variable sum

    ;Calculate difference and store in variable difference
    mov al, num1  ;Move first number into AL register
    sub al, num2  ;Subtract second number from AL register
    mov difference, al ;Store difference in variable difference

    ;Calculate product and store in variable product
    mov al, num1 ;Move first number into AL register
    mul num2     ;Multiply AL by second number and store result in AX 
    mov product, ax ;Store product in variable product

    ;Calculate quotient and store in variable quotient
    mov al, num1 ;Move first number into AL register
    div num2 ;Divide AL by second number and store result in AL 
    mov quotient, al ;Store quotient in variable quotient

    ;Print result to console
    mov ah, 02h ;Set function code for printing character to console
    mov dl, sum ;Move sum into DL register
    add dl, 30h ;Convert number to ASCII character
    int 21h ;Call interrupt 21h to print character to console
    mov dl, '-' ;Print '-' character to show separation
    int 21h ;Call interrupt 21h to print character to console
    mov dl, difference ;Move difference into DL register
    add dl, 30h ;Convert number to ASCII character
    int 21h ;Call interrupt 21h to print character to console
    mov dl, '-' ;Print '-' character to show separation
    int 21h ;Call interrupt 21h to print character to console
    mov dx, product ;Move product into DX register
    add dx, 3030h ;Convert number to ASCII characters
    mov ah, 09h ;Set function code for printing string to console
    int 21h ;Call interrupt 21h to print string to console
    mov dl, '-' ;Print '-' character to show separation
    int 21h ;Call interrupt 21h to print character to console
    mov dx, quotient ;Move quotient into DX register
    add dx, 3030h ;Convert number to ASCII characters
    mov ah, 09h ;Set function code for printing string to console
    int 21h ;Call interrupt 21h to print string to console

    ;Exit program
