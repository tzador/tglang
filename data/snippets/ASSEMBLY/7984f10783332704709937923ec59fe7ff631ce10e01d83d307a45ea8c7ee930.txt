; This code snippet multiplies two unsigned integers
; Inputs: r0 holds first number, r1 holds second number
; Output: r0 holds product of the two numbers

;first number
ldr r0, =0x000000FF ;loads the first number into r0 register

;second number
ldr r1, =0x00000010 ;loads the second number into r1 register

;product of the two numbers
mul r0, r1, r0 ;multiplies the two numbers and stores the result in r0 register

;print product
mov r7, #4 ;sets r7 register to system call to print
ldr r1, =message ;loads message into r1 register
ldr r2, =message_length ;loads message length into r2 register
svc #0 ;calls system to print the message

;exit program
mov r0, #0 ;sets r0 register with exit code 0
svc #1 ;calls system to exit program

;data section
.data 
message: .asciz "The product of the two numbers is: %u\n" ;string to be printed 
message_length: .word 30 ;length of the message

;end of program
.end
