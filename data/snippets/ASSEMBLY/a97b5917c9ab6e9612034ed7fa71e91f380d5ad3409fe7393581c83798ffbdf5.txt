; This code snippet uses MIPS assembly language to calculate the Nth term of the Fibonacci sequence

.data ; Data section
N: .word 10 ; Nth term of Fibonacci sequence
RESULT: .word 0 ; Result of calculation

.text ; Text section
main: ; Main function

; Load N into $s0
lw $s0, N 

; Move 0 and 1 into $s1 and $s2 respectively to start the sequence
addi $s1, $zero, 0
addi $s2, $zero, 1

; Loop to calculate the Nth term
loop:
    beq $s0, $zero, end ; Check if N is equal to 0, if yes, jump to end
    add $s3, $s1, $s2 ; Calculate Nth term by adding the previous two terms
    addi $s0, $s0, -1 ; Decrement N
    add $s1, $s2, $zero ; Move second term into first term
    add $s2, $s3, $zero ; Move calculated term into second term
    j loop ; Jump back to loop

end:
    sw $s3, RESULT ; Move calculated term into RESULT
    li $v0, 1 ; Load system call number for printing a integer into $v0
    lw $a0, RESULT ; Load RESULT into $a0
    syscall ; Execute system call to print RESULT

    li $v0, 10 ; Load system call number for exiting program into $v0
    syscall ; Execute system call to exit program
