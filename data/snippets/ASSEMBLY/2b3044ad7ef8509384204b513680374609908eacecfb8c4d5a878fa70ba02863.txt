; This code snippet calculates the sum of 10 numbers
.data
sum dw 0        ; declaring a variable to store the sum
numbers db 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100  ; declaring an array of numbers to be added

.code
main:
mov cx, 10      ; moving 10 into CX register to use as counter
mov si, 0       ; moving 0 into SI register to use as index for array
mov bx, offset numbers ; moving the starting address of numbers array into BX register

sum_loop:
mov ax, [bx+si] ; moving the value at address (bx+si) into AX register
add sum, ax     ; adding the value in AX register to the sum variable
inc si          ; incrementing the index by 1
loop sum_loop   ; repeating the loop until cx becomes 0

mov ah, 02h     ; function to print a character to the screen
mov dl, sum     ; moving the sum variable into DL register
add dl, 30h     ; converting the value in DL to ASCII code
int 21h         ; calling the DOS interrupt to print the sum on screen

mov ah, 4Ch     ; function to exit the program
int 21h         ; calling the DOS interrupt to exit the program
end main        ; end of program
