;This code snippet will generate a random number and store it in register 1
        MOV R0, #0     ;Move 0 into register 0
        MOV R1, #0     ;Move 0 into register 1
        MOV R2, #1     ;Move 1 into register 2
        LDR R3, =seed  ;Load the address of the seed variable into register 3
        LDR R4, =#5    ;Load the value 5 into register 4
        LDR R5, =#31   ;Load the value 31 into register 5
        
        ;Call the system timer
        ;The value obtained from the timer will be used as the seed for the random number generator
        ;The system timer is accessed through the 'systime' function
        ;The system timer returns a 10-digit hexadecimal number
        BL systime
        
        ;Store the value returned by the system timer in the seed variable
        STR R0, [R3]
        
        ;Perform some arithmetic operations on the seed
        ;Formula for generating a random number: (seed * a + c) % m 
        ;a, c, and m are predetermined constants
        ;In this case, we will use a = 1664525, c = 1013904223, and m = 4294967296
        ;The result will be stored in register 1
        
        ;Multiply the seed by a
        UMULL R1, R0, R0, R1
        UMULL R0, R0, R0, R1
        
        ;Add c to the result
        ADD R1, R1, R0
        
        ;Use the modulus operator to ensure the result is within the range of 0-4294967295 (2^32 - 1)
        ;This is done by bitwise AND with the value 4294967295
        AND R1, R1, #4294967295
        
        ;Store the result in register 1
        ;Now, register 1 contains a random number
        STR R1, [R3]
        
        ;To retrieve the random number, simply load the value from register 1
        LDR R1, [R3]
        
        ;Print the random number
        ;This will be done by calling the 'print' function and passing the value of register 1 as an argument
        ;The 'print' function takes an integer as an argument and displays it on the screen
        BL print
