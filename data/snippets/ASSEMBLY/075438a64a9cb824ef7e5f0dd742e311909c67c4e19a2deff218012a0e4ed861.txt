; a function that calculates the factorial of a number
; input: 
; r1 - number whose factorial is to be calculated
; output:
; r2 - factorial of the input number

calcFactorial:
  MOV r2, #1       ; initialize r2 to 1 since factorial of 0 is 1
  MOV r3, #1       ; initialize a counter for the loop
  MOV r4, r1       ; move input number to r4
  CMP r4, #0       ; check if input number is 0
  BEQ endLoop      ; if 0, skip loop and return factorial as 1
loop:
  MUL r2, r3, r2   ; multiply r2 by counter (r3)
  ADD r3, #1       ; increment counter
  CMP r3, r4       ; compare counter with input number
  BLT loop         ; if counter is less than input number, repeat loop
endLoop:
  BX lr            ; return from function
