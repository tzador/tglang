; Check if number is a perfect square
; Input: r1 = number to be checked
; Output: r2 = 1 if number is a perfect square, 0 if not

mov r2, #0 ; Set r2 to 0 as default
mov r3, #0 ; Counter variable
loop:
cmp r3, r1 ; Compare r3 to input number
ble end ; Branch to end if r3 is greater than input number
mul r4, r3, r3 ; Multiply r3 by itself to get square number
cmp r4, r1 ; Compare squared number to input number
bge found ; Branch to found label if squared number is greater than or equal to input number
add r3, r3, #1 ; Increment counter by 1
b loop ; Branch back to loop

found:
mov r2, #1 ; Set r2 to 1 if number is a perfect square

end:
; Output will be in r2 register
