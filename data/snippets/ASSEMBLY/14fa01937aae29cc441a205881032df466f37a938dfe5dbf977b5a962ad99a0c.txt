;Function for calculating the factorial of a number
.factorial:
    mov rax, 1 ;Initialize register rax to 1
    cmp rdi, 0 ;Compare rdi (input parameter) to 0
    je .end ;If rdi is 0, jump to end and return 1
    jge .loop ;If rdi is greater than or equal to 0, jump to loop
    mov rax, 0 ;If rdi is less than 0, set rax to 0 and return 0
.loop:
    imul rax, rdi ;Multiply rax by rdi
    dec rdi ;Decrease rdi by 1
    cmp rdi, 1 ;Compare rdi to 1
    jg .loop ;If rdi is still greater than 1, jump back to loop
.end:
    ret ;Return rax as result of factorial
