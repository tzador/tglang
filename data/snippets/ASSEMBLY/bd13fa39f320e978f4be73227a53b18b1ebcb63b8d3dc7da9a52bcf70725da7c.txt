; This code snippet is a simple program written in Assembly
; It calculates the factorial of a given number

; Set the value to calculate the factorial of
MOV CX, 5

; Initialize the result variable to 1
MOV AX, 1

; Loop through all the numbers from 1 to CX
LOPE:
; Multiply the current result with CX
MUL CX

; Decrement CX by 1
DEC CX

; Check if CX is equal to 0
CMP CX, 0

; If not equal, continue looping
JNZ LOPE

; Print the result
OUT AX

; End of program
