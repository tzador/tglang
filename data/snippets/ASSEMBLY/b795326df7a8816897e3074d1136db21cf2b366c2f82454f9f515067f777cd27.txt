; Code snippet in assembly language
; This code calculates the factorial of a number
; Input: R1 contains the number to calculate the factorial of
; Output: R2 contains the factorial of the input number

       ORG $0000         ; Set the origin of program to address 0000
START: MOV R2, #1        ; Set the initial value of R2 to 1
       MOV R3, R1        ; Move the input number to R3
LOOP:  MUL R2, R3        ; Multiply R2 by R3
       DEC R3            ; Decrement R3 by 1
       CMP R3, #0        ; Compare R3 to 0
       BNE LOOP          ; If R3 is not equal to 0, branch back to LOOP
       HALT              ; Halt the program
       END START         ; End the program and return to address START
