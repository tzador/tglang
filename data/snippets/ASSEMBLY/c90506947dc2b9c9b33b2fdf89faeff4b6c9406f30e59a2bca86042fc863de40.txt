;This code snippet is a function in Assembly language that calculates the factorial of a given number in a recursive manner.
;Input: r0 - a positive integer representing the number to calculate the factorial for
;Output: r0 - the factorial of the input number

fact:
    stmfd sp!, {lr} ;store the return address on the stack
    cmp r0, #1 ;compare the input with 1
    beq exit ;if input is 1, no need for further calculations, exit the function
    mov r1, r0 ;r1 will hold the input number
    sub r0, r0, #1 ;decrement input number by 1 for next recursive call
    bl fact ;recursive call to the fact function
    mul r0, r0, r1 ;multiply the result of recursive call with input number
    exit:
    ldmfd sp!, {pc} ;load the return address from stack and return to calling function
