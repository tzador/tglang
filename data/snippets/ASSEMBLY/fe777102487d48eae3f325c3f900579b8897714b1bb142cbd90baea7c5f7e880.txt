; A subroutine to calculate the factorial of a number
    ; Input: integer in AX register
    ; Output: factorial in AX register
    ; Assumptions: AX contains a positive number
    ; Restrictions: None
    
    ; Initialize counter register CX to 1
    MOV CX, 1
    
    ; Initialize product register BX to 1
    MOV BX, 1

        ; Multiply BX by current value of CX
        MUL CX
        
        ; Increment CX
