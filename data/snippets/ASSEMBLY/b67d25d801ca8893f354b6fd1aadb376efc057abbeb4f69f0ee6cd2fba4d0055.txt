.loop
# This is a loop in assembly language
# It initializes a counter and checks if it has reached the maximum value
# If not, it enters the loop and executes the instructions

# instructions to be executed in the loop go here
ADD R1, R1, #1	   ; add 1 to the counter
B .loop		      ; branch back to the beginning of the loop
.end_loop
# instructions to be executed after the loop go here
