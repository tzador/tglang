; An example of a long and complex code snippet in the assembly language

; Declare a label for the start of the program
Main:

; Set up the stack pointer
MOV SP, #100

; Declare a variable in memory
DATA:
    .WORD 5        ; Allocate 16 bits of memory for the variable "num"
    
; Perform some calculations
    ; Load a value into the accumulator
    LDR R0, =DATA  ; Load the address of the variable "num" into R0
    LDR R1, [R0]   ; Load the value stored at that address into R1
    ADD R1, R1, #1 ; Add 1 to the value in R1
    ; Store the result back into the variable
    STR R1, [R0]   ; Store the value in R1 back into the variable "num"

; Print the result
    ; Load the system call number for printing a value
    LDR R7, =4
    ; Load the address of the variable to be printed into R1
    LDR R1, =DATA
    ; Make the system call
    SWI 0

; Exit the program
    MOV R7, #1      ; Load the system call number for exiting a program
    SWI 0           ; Make the system call

    END Main        ; End the program and assign the label "Main" to it
