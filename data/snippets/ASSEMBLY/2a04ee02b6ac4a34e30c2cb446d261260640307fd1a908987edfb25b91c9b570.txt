; Program to find the maximum of two numbers
; Input:
; 	- First number stored in R1 register
;	- Second number stored in R2 register
; Output:
; 	- Maximum of two numbers stored in R3 register

; Initialize R3 to be the same as R1
MOV R3, R1

; Compare R2 with R1
CMP R2, R1
; If R2 is greater than R1, jump to label SET_R3_TO_R2
JGT SET_R3_TO_R2

; Otherwise, R2 is not greater than R1, so jump to label END
JMP END

; Set R3 to be the same as R2
SET_R3_TO_R2:
MOV R3, R2

; Set label END
END:
; Output the maximum of two numbers stored in R3 register
; End of program
