;; This code snippet is a simple program in Assembly that calculates the factorial of a number
;; It starts by getting the input number from the user using interrupt 0x21
;; Then it uses a loop to calculate the factorial
;; Finally, it prints the result to the console using interrupt 0x21

;; Data Segment
;; These variables will be used to store input and result
data_segment segment
    num db 0     ; stores the input number
    result db 1  ; stores the result of the factorial
data_segment ends

;; Code Segment
code_segment segment
    ;; Begin by setting the data segment as the default segment
    assume ds:data_segment

    ;; Get user input for the number using interrupt 0x21
    ;; Note: Interrupt 0x21, ah = 1 reads a character from the keyboard
    ;;       and stores it in the specified variable (in our case, num)
    ;;       Interrupt 0x21, ah = 0 prints a character to the console,
    ;;       and dl contains the character to be printed
    ;;       In this case, we use interrupt 0x21 to print "Enter a number:"
    mov ah, 0   ; set ah = 0 to print a character
    mov dl, 'E' ; set dl = 'E' to print the first character of "Enter a number:"
    int 0x21    ; call interrupt 0x21

    mov ah, 0x1 ; set ah = 1 to read a character
    int 0x21    ; call interrupt 0x21
    mov num, al ; store the input character in num

    ;; Now we calculate the factorial using a loop
    mov ah, 0   ; set ah = 0 to initialize the counter
    mov al, num ; set al = num to use as the counter limit
    mov bl, al  ; copy al to bl for later multiplication
    inc al      ; increment al by 1 to account for 0! and 1!
    mov cx, al  ; set cx = al to use as the loop counter
    mov result, al  ; store the first factorial term in result

    ;; Loop to calculate factorial
    calc:
        mul bl      ; multiply al * bl and store in ax (ax = al * bl)
        dec cx      ; decrement cx by 1 (cx = cx - 1)
        jnz calc    ; jump to calc if cx is not equal to 0

    ;; Now we print the result using interrupt 0x21
    mov ah, 0   ; set ah = 0 to print a character
    mov dl, 'R' ; set dl = 'R' to print the first character of "Result:"
    int 0x21    ; call interrupt 0x21

    mov ah, 0x0 ; set ah = 0 to print a character
    mov dl, 'e' ; set dl = 'e' to print the first character of "Enter a number:"
    int 0x21    ; call interrupt 0x21

    mov ah, 0x1 ; set ah = 1 to print the result
    mov al, result ; load the result into al
    add al, 48 ; convert the number to its ASCII equivalent
    int 0x21    ; call interrupt 0x21

    ;; Terminate the program
    mov ah, 0   ; set ah = 0 to exit the program
    int 0x21    ; call interrupt 0x21 to exit
