; This code snippet calculates the sum of two numbers
; Input: Registers R1 and R2 contain the two numbers to be added

; Addition function using registers
ADD R3, R1, R2 ; Store the sum of R1 and R2 in R3

; Output the result stored in R3
MOV R0, R3 ; Move the sum from R3 to R0 to be outputted

; Set necessary registers for output
MOV R7, #4 ; Use service code 4 to print output
MOV R0, #1 ; Specify output destination (in this case, the console)
LDR R1, =SUM ; Load the address of the string "SUM" into R1
ADD R2, R0, #0 ; Set R2 to 0 to indicate end of string
SWI #0 ; Call operating system to print output

; Initialize a string to print the sum
SUM:    DCB "The sum is: ",0xA,0xD,0x00 ; String to print followed by line feed and carriage return characters

; End of code snippet
