; This is a code snippet in assembly that calculates the factorial of a given number
; Input: Number to calculate factorial for in register R0
; Output: Factorial result stored in register R1
MOV R1, #1      ; Store value 1 in register R1 for initial calculation
LOOP:           ; Beginning of loop
    CMP R0, #1  ; Compare R0 with 1
    BEQ END     ; If R0 = 1, jump to END
    MUL R1, R0  ; Multiply R1 with R0 and store in R1
    SUB R0, #1  ; Subtract 1 from R0
    B LOOP      ; Jump back to LOOP
END:            ; End of loop
; Factorial calculation complete, result in R1
