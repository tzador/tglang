    db "Hello, World!", 0 ; Initializes "message" variable with string "Hello, World!"

; This section sets up the stack and calls the "print" function
_start:
    mov ax, @data ; Sets ax register to point to data segment
    mov ds, ax ; Sets ds register to point to data segment
    mov sp, 7FF0h ; Sets stack pointer to top of memory (7FFFh) so it grows downwards

    ; Calls the "print" function with the address of the "message" variable as its argument
    push .message ; Pushes the address of "message" onto the stack
    call print ; Calls the "print" function

    ; Halts the program
    mov ah, 4Ch
    int 21h

; This function takes a string as an argument and prints it to the screen
; Input: ax - address of string to be printed
print:
    mov ah, 9 ; Sets ah register to 9 to indicate we want to print a string
    int 21h ; Calls the appropriate system interrupt
    ret ; Returns back to the caller
.endp print

; This section defines the data segment
.data
    ; Defines a variable called "counter" and initializes it to 5
