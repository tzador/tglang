; This code snippet is a simple program that calculates the sum of two numbers

section .data ; Data section where variables are declared
    num1 dw 5 ; Declaring and initializing first number as a word (2 bytes)
    num2 dw 10 ; Declaring and initializing second number as a word (2 bytes)
    result dw 0 ; Declaring and initializing result variable to store the sum as a word (2 bytes)

section .text ; Text section where the code is written
    global _start ; Declaration of entry point for the program

_start: ; Start label for the entry point of the program
    ; Adding the two numbers and storing the result in the result variable
    mov ax, [num1] ; Moving the first number into the ax register
    add ax, [num2] ; Adding the second number to the ax register
    mov [result], ax ; Moving the result from the ax register to the result variable

    ; Printing the result to the console
    mov dx, result ; Moving the result variable into the dx register
    mov ah, 2 ; Calling the print function
    int 21h ; Interrupt call to print the result

    ; Exiting the program
    mov ah, 0 ; Setting the exit function
    mov al, 0 ; Setting the exit code
    int 20h ; Interrupt call to exit the program
