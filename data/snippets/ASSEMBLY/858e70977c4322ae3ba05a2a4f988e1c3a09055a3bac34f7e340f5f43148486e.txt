; This code snippet is a simple multiplication program in x86 assembly

; Data Section
.data  

  ; Create variables for storing the operands and result
  op1  dw 10    ; First operand, stored as a 2-byte word
  op2  dw 5     ; Second operand, stored as a 2-byte word
  result  dw 0  ; Result variable, initialized to 0

; Code Section
.code

; Main function
main:
  ; Move the first operand into the AX register
  mov ax, [op1]

  ; Store the second operand in the BX register
  mov bx, [op2]

  ; Multiply the two operands and store the result in the AX register
  ; Note: The result will be a 4-byte double word, which needs to be stored in the AX register using the 'ax' operand
  imul bx 

  ; Store the result in the 'result' variable
  ; Note: The result is still in the AX register, so we need to store it in the 'result' variable using the 'ax' operand
  mov [result], ax 
  
  ; Exit the program
  mov ah, 0   ; Set the 'ah' register to 0 (exit code)
  int 21h     ; Call the 'int 21h' interrupt to exit the program

; End of program
end main
