; This is a complex code snippet in Assembly language.
; It declares and defines three variables, performs a calculation, and stores the result.

.model small
.stack 100h

.data
var1 dw 1234 ; declaring and defining the first variable with the value 1234
var2 dw 5678 ; declaring and defining the second variable with the value 5678
result dw ? ; declaring the third variable to store the result of the calculation

.code
main proc ; starting point of the program
mov ax, @data ; moving data segment address to AX register
mov ds, ax ; pointing data segment to DS register

; performing the calculation
mov ax, var1 ; moving the value of var1 to AX register
add ax, var2 ; adding the value of var2 to AX register
mov result, ax ; moving the result to the third variable

; printing the result in the console
mov ah, 09h ; accessing the print function
mov dx, offset result ; moving the address of result to DX register
int 21h ; interrupt to print the result

mov ah, 4ch ; accessing the exit function
int 21h ; interrupt to exit the program

main endp 
end main ; end of the program
