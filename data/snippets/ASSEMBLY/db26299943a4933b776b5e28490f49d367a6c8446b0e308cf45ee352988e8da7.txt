; This code snippet computes the square of a given number and returns it
section .data ; declares the data section
    num dd 5 ; declares a double word variable with initial value 5

section .text ; declares the text section
global _start ; marks the entry point of the program

_start: ; start of program
    mov eax, [num] ; moves the value of num into eax register
    mul eax ; multiplies eax by itself, resulting in the square
    mov [num], eax ; stores the square back into num variable

    mov eax, 1 ; sets the exit system call
    mov ebx, 0 ; sets the exit status code to 0
    int 0x80 ; performs the system call to exit the program

; Output:
; num = 25 ; the square of 5
