start:
    clr a            ; Clear accumulator register
    add var1         ; Add var1 to accumulator
    inc a            ; Increment accumulator by 1
    mov r3, a        ; Move accumulator value to r3 register
    clr c            ; Clear carry flag
    jnc label1       ; Jump to label1 if carry flag is cleared
  
label1:
    inc r4           ; Increment r4 register by 1
    djnz r5, label1  ; Decrement r5 register by 1 and jump to label1 if not zero

    .org 0x200       ; Set program counter to 0x200
    
loop:
    mov a, r5        ; Move r5 register value to accumulator
    add var1         ; Add var1 to accumulator
    dec a            ; Decrement accumulator by 1
    mov r6, a        ; Move accumulator value to r6 register
    jc end           ; Jump to end if carry flag is set
    jmp loop         ; Jump to loop if carry flag is not set
    
end:
    mov r2, a        ; Move accumulator value to r2 register
    .end             ; End program

; Explanation: This code snippet calculates the sum of r5 register and var1 using assembly language instructions. It uses the accumulator register for intermediate calculations and jump instructions to control the flow of the program. The program starts at address 0x100 and ends at address 0x200. It also uses external variable var1, which is declared elsewhere in the program.
