; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number
; Input: the number whose factorial is to be calculated is stored in register AX
; Output: the factorial of the input number is stored in register DX

.model small
.stack 100h

.data
    num db 5 ; input number
    fact dw ? ; factorial of input number stored as 2-byte word

.code
    main proc
        mov ax, @data ; move data segment to AX register
        mov ds, ax ; initialize data segment
        mov ah, 00h ; clear AH register to use for calculations
        sub bh, bh ; clear BH register for internal calculations
        mov al, num ; move input number from memory to AL register
        
        ; check if input number is 0
        cmp al, 0
        je end_prog ; if input number is 0, go to end_prog

        ; if input number is not 0, continue with factorial calculation
        mov bl, num ; move input number to BL register for internal calculations
        dec bl ; decrement BL register to use as counter in loop
        mov bh, bl ; move BL to BH register for use in LOOP instruction

        dec bl ; decrement BL register
        cmp bl, 0 ; compare BL with 0
        jne loop_start ; if BL is not 0, continue loop

        ; store factorial in fact variable
        mov word ptr fact, dx ; move DX register to fact variable as 2-byte word
