; Input Variables:
;   - src: Source address
;   - dest: Destination address
;   - size: Number of bytes to copy
copy:
    mov r1, src ; Move source address to r1 register
    mov r2, dest ; Move destination address to r2 register
    mov r3, size ; Move number of bytes to copy to r3 register
    cmp r3, #0 ; Compare r3 with 0 (to check if there are bytes left to copy)
    beq exit ; If equal, jump to exit label
loop:
    ldrb r4, [r1], #1 ; Load 1 byte from source address into r4 and increment source address
    strb r4, [r2], #1 ; Store 1 byte from r4 into destination address and increment destination address
    subs r3, r3, #1 ; Subtract 1 from r3 (decrement count of bytes left to copy)
    bne loop ; If not equal, jump to loop label to continue looping
exit:
    bx lr ; Return from the function
