; This is a sample code snippet written in Assembly language

; This section defines the main program and its instructions
MAIN:
  START:  
    WRT "Enter a number:"
    RDB
    MOV R1,A 
    ADD R2,A
    WRT "Enter another number:"
    RDB
    MOV R3,A
    MUL R2,R3
    WRT "The result is:"
    WRT "R2 + (R2 * R3) = "
    ADD R2,A
    MUL R2,R3
    WRT A
    END

; Here we define variables to use in the program
    R1 EQU 1
    R2 EQU 2
    R3 EQU 3
    A EQU 0

; This is the end of the program
  END START
