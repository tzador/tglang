;This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
MAIN: ;start of program
    MOV R0, #1 ;load 1 into register R0
    MOV R1, #5 ;load 5 into register R1 (number whose factorial is to be calculated)
    BL FACTORIAL ;call factorial subroutine
    ;at this point, register R0 will hold the factorial of 5
    ;any further calculations or use of register R0 should be done before returning to main program
    
FACTORIAL: ;start of factorial subroutine
    CMP R1, #1 ;compare register R1 (number) with 1
    BEQ END ;if equal, return from subroutine
    MUL R0, R1 ;multiply register R0 (current factorial value) with register R1 (current number)
    SUB R1, #1 ;subtract 1 from register R1
    BL FACTORIAL ;call factorial subroutine again
    ;when the subroutine returns, register R0 will hold the factorial value of the original number
END:
    MOV PC, LR ;return from subroutine to the instruction after the BL instruction
    
;Example output:
;Factorial of 5 = 120 (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120)
