;; This code snippet is written in Assembly language.
;; It generates a random number and stores it in the accumulator.

;; Set the seed for the random number generator
LDA, #1
STA, RAN1

;; Load the first value of the seed
LDA RAN1

;; Multiply the value by a constant using shift and add algorithm
ASL
CLC
ADC RAND_CONST
STA RAN1

;; Load the second value of the seed
LDA RAN2

;; Multiply the value by a different constant using shift and add algorithm
ASL
CLC
ADC RAND_CONST2
STA RAN2

;; Add the two values together
LDA RAN1
CLC
ADC RAN2

;; Store the result in the accumulator
STA ACCUM

;; Print the result to the screen
LDA ACCUM
OUT

;; End of code snippet
