; This code snippet is an example of a recursive factorial function in assembly language
; It takes a number as an input and returns the factorial of that number
; The code uses the x86-64 architecture and is compatible with most modern processors

section .text
    global factorial    ; declaring the factorial function as a public symbol for external use

factorial:
    push rbp            ; push base pointer onto the stack to save its value
    mov rbp, rsp        ; move stack pointer into base pointer to create a new stack frame
    push rbx            ; push register onto the stack to save its value

    xor rbx, rbx        ; set the base case (factorial of 0) to 0
    cmp qword [rbp + 16], 0 ; compare input with 0
    je .base_case       ; if input is 0, jump to base case
    
    mov rbx, [rbp + 16] ; move the input into rbx register
    dec rbx             ; decrement rbx by 1 to prepare for recursive call
    push rbx            ; push rbx onto the stack to pass it as an argument for the recursive call
    call factorial      ; call the factorial function recursively
    mul qword [rbp + 16]; multiply the result of the recursive call with the current input
    jmp .end            ; jump to the end of the code to avoid executing the base case

.base_case:
    mul rbx, 1          ; multiply rbx (set to 0) with 1 to return 0 as the factorial of 0

.end:
    pop rbx             ; pop the saved register values from the stack
    pop rbp
    ret                 ; return from the function

section .data
    ; the function can be called from any other part of the code
    ; by passing the input as a parameter in the rax register
    ; and the result will be stored in the rax register
