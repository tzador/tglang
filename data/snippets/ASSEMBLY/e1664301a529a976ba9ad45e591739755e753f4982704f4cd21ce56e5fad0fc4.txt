;This code snippet assigns a value to a register, adds one to it, and stores the result in memory 

.model large 
.stack 100h 

.data 
num1 dw 1000 ;define a 16-bit variable named num1 and assign it a value of 1000 

.code 
main proc 

mov ax, @data ;move the data segment address to the ax register 
mov ds, ax ;move the data segment address to the ds register 

mov bx, offset num1 ;move the address of num1 to the bx register 
mov ax, [bx] ;move the value at the address stored in bx to the ax register 
add ax, 1 ;add 1 to ax 
mov [bx], ax ;move the value in ax to the memory location stored in bx 
mov ax, [bx] ;move the new value at the address stored in bx to ax 
;At this point, ax will contain the value 1001
