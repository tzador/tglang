; This code snippet is a subroutine that computes the factorial of a given number
; Input:
; - r0: the number to compute the factorial of
; - r1: a temporary register for computation
; Output:
; - r0: the factorial of the input number

factorial:
  MOV r1,#1            ; set r1 to 1 for multiplication
  CMP r0,#1            ; compare r0 to 1
  BEQ done             ; if r0 equals 1, jump to done section
  MOV r4,r0            ; copy r0 into r4 for use later
  SUB r4,#1            ; subtract 1 from r4
  BL factorial         ; call this subroutine with r4 as the argument
  MUL r0,r4,r0         ; multiply r0 by r4, store result in r0
done:
  BX lr                ; return from subroutine to calling function
