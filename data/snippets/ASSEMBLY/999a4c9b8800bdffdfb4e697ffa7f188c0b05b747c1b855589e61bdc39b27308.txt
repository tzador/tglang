### This code snippet uses the Assembly language for the 8086 processor.

.model small
.stack 100h

.data
  msg db 'Hello, world!',0dh,0ah,'$'

.code
  main proc
    mov ax,@data
    mov ds,ax

    lea dx,msg
    mov ah,09h
    int 21h

    mov ah,4ch
    int 21h
  main endp
end main

; This snippet starts by defining the memory model as 'small' and setting the stack size to 100h.
; The data section is then defined, containing the message 'Hello, world!' and a line break followed by the dollar sign.
; Next, the code section starts with the 'main' procedure.
; The 'mov' instruction is used to move the address of the data section to the 'ax' register, and then the 'ds' register is loaded with the value of 'ax'.
; The 'lea' instruction is used to load the address of the message into the 'dx' register.
; The 'mov' instruction is used to move the value of 09h (the code for writing a string) to the 'ah' register.
; The 'int' instruction is used to call the interrupt 21h, which prints the string located at the address stored in 'dx'.
; After the string is printed, the 'mov' instruction is used to move the value of 4ch (the code for terminating the program) to the 'ah' register.
; The 'int' instruction is again used to call the interrupt 21h, which terminates the program.
; Finally, the 'main' procedure is ended and the program is ended with the 'end main' directive.
