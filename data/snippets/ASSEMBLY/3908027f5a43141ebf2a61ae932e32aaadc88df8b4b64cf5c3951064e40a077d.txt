;; This code snippet calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
;; and stores it in the AX register

;; Initialize the variables
MOV AX, 0
MOV BX, 1
MOV CX, 2

;; Check if the input is less than or equal to 2
CMP CX, 2
JBE RETURN

;; Loop through the sequence
LOOP:
ADD AX, BX
XCHG AX, BX
DEC CX
CMP CX, 2
JNZ LOOP

;; Return the result
RETURN:
RET
