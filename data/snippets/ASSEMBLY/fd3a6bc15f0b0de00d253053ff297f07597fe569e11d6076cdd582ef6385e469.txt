; Sample code snippet in ASSEMBLY

; This code snippet declares two variables and performs arithmetic operations on them
; The result is stored in a third variable and printed out

; Declare variables with data types
variable1: db 5 ; Declares variable1 as a byte with the value of 5
variable2: dw 10 ; Declares variable2 as a word with the value of 10
variable3: dd ? ; Declares variable3 as a double word, '?' represents an uninitialized value

; Code segment
.code

; Start of code
start:
    ; Load values from variable1 and variable2 into registers
    mov al, [variable1] ; Load byte from variable1 into al register
    mov ax, [variable2] ; Load word from variable2 into ax register

    ; Perform addition operation and store result in variable3
    add al, ah ; Adds the contents of al and ah registers
    mov [variable3], al ; Move the result to variable3

    ; Print out the result
    ; Load value from variable3 into dx register
    mov dx, [variable3]

    ; Set up parameters for printing
    mov ah, 2 ; Set ah register to value 2, indicating print operation
    mov dl, dx ; Move value from dx register to dl register, representing the character to print

    ; Make interrupt call to print
    int 21h ; Calls the interrupt service routine with the value of ah

    ; End of code 
    ret ; Returns to the caller program

; End of code segment
end start ; Indicates the end of the code segment and the program start label
