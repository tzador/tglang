;; This code snippet multiplies two 32-bit numbers and stores the result in a 64-bit register

MOV EAX, DWORD PTR [NUM1] ; Move first number into EAX register
MOV EDX, DWORD PTR [NUM2] ; Move second number into EDX register
MUL EDX                  ; Multiply EAX by EDX and store result in EDX:EAX (64-bit register)
MOV DWORD PTR [RESULT], EAX ; Move lower 32 bits of result into RESULT variable
MOV DWORD PTR [RESULT+4], EDX ; Move upper 32 bits of result into RESULT+4 variable
