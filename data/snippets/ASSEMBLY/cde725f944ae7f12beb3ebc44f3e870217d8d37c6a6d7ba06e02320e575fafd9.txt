; This code snippet is a basic implementation of a bubble sort algorithm in Assembly language.
; It takes an array of integers as input and sorts them in ascending order.
; Assumes that the array starts at memory address 0x0000 and has a maximum size of 10 elements.
; Each integer is represented by 2 bytes (16 bits) in memory.

         .org    0x0000   ; memory address where the array begins

main:    mov     r0, #1    ; initialize counter for outer loop
         mov     r1, #9    ; set maximum number of iterations for outer loop

outerLoop:
         cmp     r0, r1    ; compare counter to maximum number of iterations
         bge     finish    ; branch to finish if counter is equal or greater than maximum iterations

         mov     r2, #0    ; initialize counter for inner loop
         add     r3, r0, #1  ; calculate starting index for inner loop

innerLoop:
