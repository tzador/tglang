; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number

section .data
    num db 5               ; number whose factorial is to be found

section .text 
    global _start

_start:
    mov eax, 1             ; initialize accumulator with 1
    mov ebx, 1             ; initialize counter with 1

    loop:
        mul ebx            ; multiply accumulator with counter
        inc ebx            ; increment counter
        cmp ebx, byte[num] ; compare counter with number
        jle loop          ; repeat loop until counter is less than or equal to number

    mov dword[answer], eax ; store answer in 'answer' variable

    mov eax, 1             ; system call number for 'exit'
    mov ebx, 0             ; exit status
    int 0x80               ; call kernel to exit

section .bss
    answer resd 1          ; variable to store answer
