; This program multiplies two 32-bit signed integers (A, B) and stores the result in a 64-bit register (EAX)
MOV EAX, A    ; move value of A into EAX register
IMUL B        ; multiply B with value in EAX register, result is stored in DX:AX pair of registers
SHL EDX, 32   ; shift the 32-bit result in EDX to the left by 32 bits, making room for the higher 32 bits of the product
OR EAX, EDX   ; combine the lower 32 bits of the product (in EAX) with the higher 32 bits (in EDX)
RET           ; return from subroutine
