; Calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms
; Input:
; - n: Number of terms to calculate
; Output:
; - Fibonacci sequence up to n terms stored in memory addresses

        mov     bx, 1               ; Set bx register to 1 to start sequence at 1

next:   add     bx, cx              ; Add current term (cx) to previous term (bx) to get next term in sequence
