; This is a code snippet in Assembly language that takes two values from memory and adds them together
; It then stores the result in another memory location

section .text ; Beginning of the code section
    global _start ; Global declaration for _start label

_start: ; Start label for the code

    ; Define variables for the two values to be added and the result
    mov eax, [value1] ; Moving the first value to register eax
    mov ebx, [value2] ; Moving the second value to register ebx
    add eax, ebx ; Adding the two values and storing the result in eax

    ; Store the result in memory
    mov [result], eax ; Moving the result from eax to the result variable in memory

    ; Exit the program
    mov ebx, 0 ; Move 0 to ebx register to indicate successful termination
    mov eax, 1 ; System call 1 for exit
    int 0x80 ; Execute the system call

section .data ; Beginning of the data section
    value1 dd 10 ; First value to be added, stored as double word (4 bytes)
    value2 dd 20 ; Second value to be added, stored as double word (4 bytes)
    result dd 0 ; Result variable, initialized to 0, stored as double word (4 bytes)
