;This program calculates the factorial of a number

.data
number DB 10 ;variable containing the number to be calculated
result DB 1 ;variable to store the result

.code
main PROC ;start of the main program

;loop to multiply the number by decreasing values until it reaches 1
mov al, number ;move the number into the AL register
mov bl, number ;move the number into the BL register
dec bl ;decrement BL by 1

loop1: ;label for the loop
mul bl ;multiply the number stored in AL by the value in BL
dec bl ;decrement BL by 1
jnz loop1 ;jump to loop1 if BL is not equal to 0

mov result, al ;move the result from AL into the result variable

;printing the result
mov ah, 02h ;set up AH for interrupt
mov dl, result ;move the result into DL (char to print)
add dl, '0' ;convert result to ASCII
int 21h ;call interrupt to print the result

exit ;exit program

main ENDP ;end of main program
END main ;end of program
