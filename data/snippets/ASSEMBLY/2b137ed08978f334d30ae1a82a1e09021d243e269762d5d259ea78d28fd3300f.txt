; This is a code snippet that initializes variables and performs calculations in Assembly language
; Variable declaration
NUM DW 3 ; a variable storing the value 3 in doubleword format
SUM DB 0 ; a variable storing the sum of two numbers in byte format
MULTIPLIER DW 2 ; a variable storing the value 2 in doubleword format
divisor DW 4 ; a variable storing the value 4 in doubleword format
; Calculations
MOV AX, NUM ; moves the value of NUM into the AX register
MUL MULTIPLIER ; multiplies AX by the value of MULTIPLIER and stores the result in AX
; AX now holds the value 6 (3 * 2)
DIV divisor ; divides AX by the value of divisor and stores the quotient in AL
; AL now holds the value 1 (6 / 4)
ADD AL, NUM ; adds the value of NUM to AL
; AL now holds the value 4 (1 + 3)
MOV SUM, AL ; moves the value of AL into the SUM variable
; End of code snippet
