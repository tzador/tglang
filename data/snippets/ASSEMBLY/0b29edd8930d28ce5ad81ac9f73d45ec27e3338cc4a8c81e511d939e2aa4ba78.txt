; This is a comment in assembly language.

; Define some variables:
data1 db 5   ; first data variable, defined as a byte
data2 dw 10  ; second data variable, defined as a word
data3 dd 20  ; third data variable, defined as a double word

; Code section:
.code

main proc
    ; Store the values of the variables into registers:
    mov ax, data1   ; move the value of data1 into ax register
    mov bx, data2   ; move the value of data2 into bx register
    mov cx, data3   ; move the value of data3 into cx register

    ; Do some calculations:
    add ax, bx      ; add the values of ax and bx
    sub cx, ax      ; subtract the value of ax from cx
    mul cx          ; multiply ax by cx

    ; Display the result:
    mov ah, 2       ; set the ah register to 2 (print function)
    mov dl, al      ; move the result (in al) into dl register (print character)
    int 21h         ; call interrupt 21h (print to console)

    ; End of program:
    mov ah, 4ch     ; set the ah register to 4ch (exit function)
    int 21h         ; call interrupt 21h (exit program)
