;; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number

;; Set the number to calculate the factorial of
MOV R0, 6

;; Initialize the factorial variable
MOV R1, 1 
LOOP:
;; Check if the number is 1
CMP R0, 1
JE END 
;; Multiply the factorial variable by the number
MUL R1, R0
;; Decrease the number by 1
SUB R0, 1
JMP LOOP
END:
;; The factorial is stored in R1
;; Print the result
