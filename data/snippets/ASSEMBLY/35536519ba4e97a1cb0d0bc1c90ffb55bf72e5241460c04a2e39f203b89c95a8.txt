    global _start

_start:
    mov rax, 0x1    ; set system call number to 1 (write)
    mov rdi, 0x1    ; set file descriptor number to 1 (stdout)
    mov rsi, buffer ; set buffer address to second argument
    mov rdx, 0x20   ; set buffer size to third argument
    syscall         ; make system call

    mov rax, 0x3c   ; set system call number to 60 (exit)
    xor rdi, rdi    ; set exit code to 0
    syscall         ; make system call

; This code snippet will write 32 bytes from the buffer to the standard output and then exit with a return code of 0. The buffer is reserved in the .bss section and the address is moved into the rsi register. The system calls are made using the syscall instruction and the appropriate arguments are passed in the rax, rdi, rsi, and rdx registers.
