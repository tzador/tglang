; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number

.data
    number DB 5      ; The number for which the factorial is calculated
    result DB ?      ; The result of the factorial calculation
    count DB 1       ; The count variable used in the loop
    factorial DB 1   ; The product of the factorial operation

.code
    main PROC
    mov al, number   ; Move the value of 'number' into the AL register
    mov cl, count    ; Move the value of 'count' into the CL register

factorial_loop:
    mul cl           ; Multiply AX with CL, the result is stored in AX
    add cl, 1        ; Increment the value of CL by 1
    cmp cl, al       ; Compare CL with AL
    jle factorial_loop   ; If CL is less than or equal to AL, jump to 'factorial_loop'
    mov factorial, al    ; Move the result from AL into the 'factorial' variable

    mov result, factorial  ; Move the 'factorial' variable into the 'result' variable

    mov ah, 09h       ; Function to print a string
    lea dx, result    ; Load the address of 'result' into the DX register
    int 21h           ; Call the interrupt 21h to print the string
    mov ah, 0         ; Clear the AH register

    mov ah, 4Ch       ; Function to exit the program
    int 21h           ; Call the interrupt 21h to exit the program
