;Using the X86 assembly language, this code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
.data
num db 5 ;number to calculate the factorial for
.factorial dw ? ;variable to store the factorial result
.code
;initialize the stack pointer
start:
mov ax, @data
mov ds, ax
mov es, ax

mov cx, 1  ;initialize the counter
mov dx, 1  ;initialize the factorial result

loop1:
cmp cx, num ;comparing counter to number
jae loop2 ;jump if counter is greater than or equal to number

mul cx ;multiply the factorial result by the counter
inc cx ;increment the counter
jmp loop1 ;jump back to the beginning of the loop

loop2:
mov factorial, dx ;store the final factorial result in memory
mov ax, 4c00h ;exit program
int 21h ;call interrupt to terminate program
end start ;end program
