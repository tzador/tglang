; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
section .data ; Data section
    num dd 5 ; Declares and initializes the number whose factorial is to be calculated
    fac dd 1 ; Declares and initializes the factorial variable to store the final result

    global _start ; Declares the program's entry point
_start: ; Program's entry point
    
    mov eax, [num] ; Moves the value of num into the EAX register
    cmp eax, 1 ; Compares the value in EAX with 1
    jbe end ; Jumps to end if the value in EAX is less than or equal to 1
    
    loop: ; Loop label
        mul dword [fac] ; Multiplies the value in EAX with the value in fac
        dec eax ; Decrements the value in EAX by 1
        cmp eax, 1 ; Compares the value in EAX with 1
        jne loop ; Jumps to loop if the value in EAX is not equal to 1
    
    end: ; End label
        mov [fac], eax ; Moves the value of EAX into the fac variable
        mov ebx, [num] ; Moves the value of num into the EBX register
        mov eax, 1 ; Moves the value 1 into the EAX register
        int 0x80 ; System call to exit the program
