;This code snippet calculates the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence

;Set up variables for the first two terms of the sequence
;First term is 0
FIB1 EQU 0
;Second term is 1
FIB2 EQU 1

;Set up count and loop variables
;Count represents the current term being calculated
;Loop is used to iterate through the for loop
COUNT EQU 0
LOOP EQU 10

;Initialize values for the previous and current terms
;Previous term starts as 0
PREV EQU 0
;Current term starts as 1
CURR EQU 1

;Start of the for loop
FOR:
    ;Check if the count is equal to the loop value
    ;If yes, then exit the loop
    CMP COUNT, LOOP
    JE EXIT

    ;Calculate the next term in the sequence
    ;Using the formula Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
    ;Store the result in the current term variable
    MOV CURR, PREV
    ADD CURR, FIB2
    MOV PREV, FIB2
    MOV FIB2, CURR

    ;Print the current term
    ;Set up registers for printing
    MOV AH, 02H ;Function for printing character
    MOV DL, CURR ;Move current term into register
    ADD DL, 30H ;Convert to ASCII
    INT 21H ;Print character

    ;Increment count by 1
    INC COUNT

    ;Continue loop by jumping back to FOR label
    JMP FOR

;Exit the loop
EXIT:
    ;Set up registers for printing a new line
    MOV AH, 02H ;Function for printing character
    MOV DL, 0AH ;New line character
    INT 21H ;Print new line

    ;Exit the program
    MOV AH, 4CH ;Function for exiting program
    INT 21H ;Exit program
