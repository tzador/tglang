; This is a code snippet in Assembly language that calculates the sum of two numbers.
; The code snippet takes two values from memory locations, adds them together, and stores the result in another memory location.

.section data				; Defines a section for global data
a:		.dword 5			; Defines a memory location with value 5
b:		.dword 3			; Defines another memory location with value 3
result:	.dword 0			; Defines a memory location to store the result

.section text				; Defines a section for program instructions
	.global main			; Declares a main function

main:	
	; Load values from memory into registers
	movl a, %eax			; Move value of a into eax register
	movl b, %ebx			; Move value of b into ebx register

	; Add the values in registers and store the result in another register
	addl %eax, %ebx			; Add the two values, store result in ebx register

	; Store the result back into memory
	movl %ebx, result		; Move value in ebx (result) into result memory location

	; End program
	movl $1, %eax			; Put exit syscall number into eax register
	xorl %ebx, %ebx			; Put 0 into ebx register for exit status
	int $0x80				; Call system interrupt to exit program
