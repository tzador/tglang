;This snippet sets a value to a variable and multiplies it by 2
;Assumes the variable is stored in register R1 and the value is 5

MUL R1, R1, #2 ;Multiply R1 by 2
MOV R2, #5      ;Move the value 5 into R2
ADD R1, R1, #1  ;Add 1 to R1
SUB R1, R1, #2  ;Subtract 2 from R1
MOV R3, #0      ;Move the value 0 into R3

LOOP:           ;Start of Loop
CMP R1, R2      ;Compare R1 and R2
BEQ END         ;Branch to END if equal
ADD R3, R3, R1  ;Add R1 to R3
ADD R1, R1, #1  ;Add 1 to R1
B LOOP          ;Branch back to START of Loop

END:            ;End of Loop
NOP             ;No Operation
