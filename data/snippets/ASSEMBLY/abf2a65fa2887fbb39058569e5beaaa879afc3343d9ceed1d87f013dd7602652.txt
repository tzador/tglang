; This code snippet demonstrates a complex assembly program that calculates the sum of two numbers
; Inputs: two numbers, stored in memory locations NUM1 and NUM2 as ASCII characters
; Output: the sum of the two numbers, stored in memory location RESULT as an ASCII character

; Define memory locations
NUM1    db  '2'     ; First number to be added
NUM2    db  '3'     ; Second number to be added
RESULT  db  ?       ; Result of addition

; Load first number into accumulator
    MOV AX, NUM1
    MOV BL, [AX]

; Convert ASCII character to numeric value
    SUB BL, 30h

; Load second number into accumulator
    MOV AX, NUM2
    MOV CL, [AX]

; Convert ASCII character to numeric value
    SUB CL, 30h

; Add the two numbers and store the result in accumulator
    ADD BL, CL

; Convert numeric value to ASCII character
    ADD BL, 30h

; Store result in memory location
    MOV AX, RESULT
    MOV [AX], BL
