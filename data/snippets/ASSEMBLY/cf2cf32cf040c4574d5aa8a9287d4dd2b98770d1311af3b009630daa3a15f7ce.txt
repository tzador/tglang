;; This code snippet is a program that calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user using recursion.
;; It takes in the user input, stores it in a register, and then calls the factorial function with that input as argument.
;; The factorial function then uses recursion to calculate the factorial of the number, storing the result in a register.
;; Finally, the result is printed out to the console.

;; clear registers
MOV R1, #0 ; clear register for input
MOV R2, #0 ; clear register for result

;; take in user input
GETC R1 ; get input from user and store in R1

;; call factorial function
CALL factorial

;; print result
PUTS "The factorial of the input number is: "
PUTC R2 ; print result to console

;; end program
HALT

;; factorial function

    ;; save the current PC value to stack to be returned to after function call

    ;; check for base case
    CMPI R1, #0 ; compare input with 0
    BNE not_zero ; if input is not 0, continue on with recursion
    MOVI R2, #1 ; if input is 0, set result to 1 and return
    POPPC ; return to previous PC
    RET

    ;; recursive call
    not_zero:
        DECI R1 ; decrement input by 1 for next recursive call
        CALL factorial ; call factorial function recursively
        MULI R2, R2, R1 ; multiply result by current input number
        POPPC ; return to previous PC after recursion completes
        RET
