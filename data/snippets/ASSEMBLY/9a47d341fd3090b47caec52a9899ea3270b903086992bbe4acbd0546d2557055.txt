; Example code in Assembly language
;
; This code snippet is a simple program that takes two numbers from the user
; and returns their sum.
;
; The program starts at the main label and first initializes the stack pointer
; to point to the top of the stack.
;
; Then, it prompts the user to enter the first number and stores it in register
; r1 using the MOV instruction.
;
; Next, it prompts the user to enter the second number and stores it in 
; register r2 using the MOV instruction.
;
; We then add the contents of r1 and r2 registers and store it in register r3
; using the ADD instruction.
;
; Finally, we print the sum by using the PRINT instruction and clear the 
; registers by setting them to 0.
;
; Initialize stack pointer
MAIN:       LD SP, #STACK_TOP

; Prompt user for first number and store in r1
            PRINT "Enter first number: "
            MOV r1, #0
            IN r1, #1

; Prompt user for second number and store in r2
            PRINT "Enter second number: "
            MOV r2, #0
            IN r2, #1

; Add contents of r1 and r2 and store in r3
            ADD r3, r1, r2

; Print the sum
            PRINT "The sum is: "
            MOV r0, r3
            PRINT r0

; Clear registers
            MOV r0, #0
            MOV r1, #0
            MOV r2, #0
            MOV r3, #0

; End program
            STOP
