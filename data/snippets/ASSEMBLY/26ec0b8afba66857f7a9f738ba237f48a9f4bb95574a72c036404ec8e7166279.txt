.data ; Tells the assembler that the following lines of code are for data
myString db 'Hello, world!',0xA,0xD ; Defines a byte-sized variable named myString and initializes it with the string 'Hello, world!' followed by the newline and carriage return characters
.code ; Tells the assembler that the following lines of code are for instructions
start: ; Marks the beginning of the code
		mov ax, @data ; Copies the address of the data section to the AX register
		mov ds, ax ; Moves the value in AX to the data segment register, making it the default data segment
		mov ah, 09h ; Sets AH to 09h, indicating that the following instruction will print a string
		mov dx, OFFSET myString ; Moves the offset address of myString to the DX register
		int 21h ; Causes the interrupt 21h (the DOS interrupt for character input and output) to be executed
		mov ah, 0 ; Sets AH back to 0 to indicate the program has finished
		int 20h ; Causes the interrupt 20h (the DOS interrupt for program termination) to be executed
end start ; Marks the end of the code
