; This code snippet generates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
; Input:
;   n - the nth term to be generated
; Output:
;   r0 - the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence

mov r0, #0    ; initialize r0 to 0 (first term)
mov r1, #1    ; initialize r1 to 1 (second term)
cmp n, #2     ; check if n is less than 2
blt done      ; if true, skip to end
loop:
    add r2, r0, r1    ; calculate next term by adding previous two terms
    mov r0, r1        ; shift r1 into r0 (first previous term becomes second previous term)
    mov r1, r2        ; shift r2 into r1 (new term becomes second term)
    sub n, n, #1      ; decrement n
    cmp n, #2         ; check if n is less than 2
    bge loop          ; if greater or equal, continue looping
done:
    b done            ; branch to end of program
