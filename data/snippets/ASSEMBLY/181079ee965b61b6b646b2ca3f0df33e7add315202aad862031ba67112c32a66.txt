; Function to calculate the factorial of a given number
; Takes in one argument (the number to calculate factorial for) and stores the result in R0

    .global factorial            ; Marks this function as global, meaning it can be called from
                                ; other parts of the program
    
factorial:
    MOV R1, #1                  ; Move the value 1 into register R1 to use as a counter for the loop
    MOV R0, #1                  ; Move the value 1 into register R0 as the initial result
    CMP R0, R1                  ; Compare the result with the counter
    BEQ end                     ; If they are equal, jump to the end label to end the function
    SUB R1, R1, #1              ; Subtract 1 from the counter to use in the loop
    MUL R0, R0, R1              ; Multiply the result by the current counter value to calculate factorial
    B factorial                 ; Jump back to the beginning of the loop
end:
    BX LR                       ; Branch and Exchange to return to the calling function, storing the result in R0
