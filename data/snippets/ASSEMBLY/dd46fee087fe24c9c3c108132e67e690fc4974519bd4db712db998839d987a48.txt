; This code calculates the factorial of a number and stores the result in accumulator
;
.code
  mov ax, 1          ; initialize accumulator with 1
  mov bx, 5          ; number whose factorial is to be calculated

factorial:
  mul bx             ; multiply accumulator by number
  dec bx             ; decrement number
  jnz factorial      ; keep looping until number reaches 0

  mov [result], ax   ; store result in memory

.code
.data
  result dd 0        ; reserve memory to store result

.end
