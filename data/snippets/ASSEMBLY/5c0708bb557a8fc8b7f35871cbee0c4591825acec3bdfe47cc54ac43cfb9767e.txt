# This code snippet uses the assembly language to calculate the factorial of a number

# Define variables
.section .data
number:
    .long 5  # The number whose factorial is to be calculated
result:
    .long 1  # Variable to store the factorial value
temp:
    .long 1  # Temporary variable for calculations

.section .text
.globl _start

# Main program
_start:
    movl number, %ebx  # Move the number to be calculated into ebx register
    movl $1, %edx  # Initialize counter to 1
    jmp loop  # Jump to loop label

# Loop to calculate factorial
loop:
    cmpl $1, %ebx  # Compare the number in ebx register with 1
    je end  # If number is 1, jump to end label
    imull %edx, result  # Multiply result variable with counter and store in result variable
    addl $1, %edx  # Increment counter by 1
    subl $1, %ebx  # Decrement number by 1
    jmp loop  # Jump back to loop label

# End of loop
end:
    movl $1, %eax  # Set exit status
    int $0x80  # Exit program
