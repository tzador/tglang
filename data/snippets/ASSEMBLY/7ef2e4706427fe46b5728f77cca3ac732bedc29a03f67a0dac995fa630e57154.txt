;This code snippet calculates the sum of two numbers using addition.
;Inputs: two integers stored in registers r1 and r2
;Output: the sum stored in register r3
;Assuming both inputs are positive
    
start:
    mov r3, #0 ;initialize r3 to 0
    cmp r1, #0
    blt skip ;if r1 is not positive, skip to end
    cmp r2, #0
    blt skip ;if r2 is not positive, skip to end
    
    ;add r2 to r3, update r3 to the new sum
    add r3, r3, r2 
    ;decrement r1 by 1
    sub r1, r1, #1 
    b loop ;go to loop to repeat until r1 = 0
    
skip:
    ;if r1 or r2 are negative, set output to -1
    mov r3, #-1 
    
end:
    ;output the result stored in r3
    mov r0, r3 
    ;terminate the program
    swi #0 

loop:
    cmp r1, #0
    bne start ;repeat loop until r1 = 0
    b end ;go to end to output the final result and terminate the program
