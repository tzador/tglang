; This code snippet is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
;
; Input: r0 = number to find factorial of
; Output: r0 = factorial of input number

	LDR r0, num ; load input number into r0
	MOV r1, #1 ; initialize r1 to 1, will be used as counter
	MOV r2, #1 ; initialize r2 to 1, will be used for multiplication
loop:	CMP r1, r0 ; compare r1 (counter) with r0 (input number)
	BNE multiply ; if r1 is not equal to r0, go to multiply
	BX LR ; if r1 is equal to r0, return to main program

multiply:	MUL r2, r2, r1 ; multiply r2 (current product) by r1 (counter)
	ADD r1, r1, #1 ; increment counter by 1
	B loop ; go back to loop

num:	DCD 5 ; example input number, can be changed
