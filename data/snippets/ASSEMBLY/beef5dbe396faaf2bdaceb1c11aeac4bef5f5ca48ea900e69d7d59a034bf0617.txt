;This code snippet is a simple flow that calculates the factorial of a given number.
;It uses a loop and conditional branching to perform the calculation.
;The initial value of the number is stored in the AL register.
;The result will be stored in the AX register at the end of the calculation.

.code
start:
 ;Setting up stack
  mov  sp, #0x7FF0
  
 ;Function to calculate factorial
calc_fact:
  ;Initializing result to 1
  mov  ax, #1
  
  ;Comparing value in AL with 1
  cmp  al, #1
  
  ;Jump to end if value is 1
  je   end
  
  ;Decrementing the value in AL
  dec  al
  
  ;Multiplying the result in AX with the decremented value in AL
  mul  al
  
  ;Jump back to calc_fact function
  jmp  calc_fact
  
end:
  ;Storing the factorial result in AX register
  mov  ax, #$FF
  
 ;Exiting the program
