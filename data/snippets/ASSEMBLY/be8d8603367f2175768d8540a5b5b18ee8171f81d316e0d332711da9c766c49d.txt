; This program calculates the factorial of a number

; Set the number to calculate factorial for
MOV AX, 5 ; number = 5

; Initialize the factorial value to 1
MOV CX, 1 ; factorial = 1

; Loop to calculate factorial
FACTORIAL:
    MUL CX ; multiply CX with AX, result stored in AX
    INC CX ; increment CX by 1
    CMP CX, AX ; compare CX with AX
    JNE FACTORIAL ; if CX is not equal to AX, jump back to FACTORIAL

; Store the factorial value in BX
MOV BX, AX ; BX = AX (factorial value)

; Print the result
MOV AH, 09H ; set print function
MOV DX, BX ; set value to print
INT 21H ; call interrupt to print value

; End program
MOV AH, 4CH ; set program end function
INT 21H ; call interrupt to end program
