;Initialize registers
mov ax, 0 ;move value 0 into ax register
mov bx, 2 ;move value 2 into bx register
mov cx, 10 ;move value 10 into cx register
mov dx, 1 ;move value 1 into dx register

loop_start: ;start of loop
;add bx and dx
add bx, dx
;compare bx to cx
cmp bx, cx
;if bx is not equal to cx, jump to loop_start
jne loop_start

;print result
mov ah, 09h ;set ah to 09h, which is the print function
mov dx, bx ;move the result from bx to dx, which is the print buffer
int 21h ;call int 21h, which is the system call interrupt
;this will print the result stored in dx to the screen

;end of program
mov ah, 4Ch ;set ah to 4Ch, which is the exit function
mov al, 0 ;set al to 0, which is the exit code
int 21h ;call int 21h, which is the system call interrupt
