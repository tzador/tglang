MAIN PROC ; defining the main procedure

; move the value of NUMBER into the EAX register
MOV EAX, NUMBER

; multiply the value in EAX by 2
IMUL EAX, 2

; add 7 to the value in EAX
ADD EAX, 7

; move the result into the EBX register
MOV EBX, EAX

; perform a bitwise AND operation between the values in EAX and EBX
AND EAX, EBX

; perform a bitwise OR operation between the values in EAX and EBX
OR EAX, EBX

; subtract 5 from the value in EAX
SUB EAX, 5

; divide the value in EAX by 3
IDIV EAX, 3

; store the result in the EDI register
MOV EDI, EAX

; print the result to the console
MOV AH, 0 ; set AH to 0 to use the print function
MOV DL, EDI ; move the value in EDI (result) to DL register for printing
INT 21h ; call the print function

; exit the program
