; This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number
main:
    mov ax, 1 ; initialize accumulator to 1
    mov bx, number ; load number into bx register
    mov cx, bx ; copy number into cx register
    loop_start:
        cmp bx, 0 ; compare bx register to 0
        je end ; jump to end if bx is equal to 0
        mul bx ; multiply ax by bx
        dec bx ; decrement bx register by 1
        loop loop_start ; repeat until bx is equal to 0
    end: ; end of loop
    mov result, ax ; store result in variable called "result"
