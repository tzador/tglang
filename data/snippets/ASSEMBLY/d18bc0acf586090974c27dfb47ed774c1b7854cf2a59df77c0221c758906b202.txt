; This code snippet is for division operation in assembly language

mov ax, 7 ; Move the value 7 into the AX register
mov bx, 2 ; Move the value 2 into the BX register

div bx ; Divide the value in AX by the value in BX

; The result will be stored in the AX register
; AX = 3 (7 / 2)

; Register values after division operation:
; AX = 3
; BX = 2

; Additional code can be written to handle the remainder if needed
