; This code snippet is a simple summing program in Assembly language
; It takes two numbers from memory, adds them together, and stores the result back into memory

; Set up data segment
.DATA
num1 DWORD 10  ; First number to be added, stored in a 32-bit double word
num2 DWORD 5   ; Second number to be added, stored in a 32-bit double word
result DWORD ? ; Variable to store the sum, initialized with a question mark

; Set up code segment
.CODE
MAIN PROC
  ; Load first number into accumulator register (EAX)
  mov eax, num1

  ; Add second number to accumulator register
  add eax, num2

  ; Store result back into memory
  mov result, eax

  ; End program
  ; Return to operating system
  mov eax, 0     ; Set system call number for exit
  int 0x80       ; Call system function to exit
MAIN ENDP
