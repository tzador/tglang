; This code snippet multiplies two 16-bit numbers and stores the result in a 32-bit register

mov ax, 1234h ; move the first number (1234 in hexadecimal) to the AX register
mov bx, 5678h ; move the second number (5678 in hexadecimal) to the BX register

mul bx ; multiply the two numbers in AX and BX, result will be stored in DX:AX

mov dx, ax ; move the lower 16 bits of the result (stored in AX) to the DX register
mov ax, dx ; move the contents of DX back to AX, this will clear the higher 16 bits of AX

mov cx, ax ; move the lower 16 bits of the result (cleared AX) to the CX register
mov dx, 0000h ; clear the DX register, as it will be used to store the higher 16 bits of the result

jmp end ; jump to the end of the program

mul_loop:
    shl ax, 1 ; left shift AX by 1 bit
    rcl dx, 1 ; rotate the contents of DX to the left by 1 bit, carry flag will hold higher bit of AX

    dec cx ; decrement CX, acts as a counter to keep track of the number of bits processed
    jz end ; jump to the end of the program if CX has reached 0, all bits have been processed

    cmp ax, bx ; compare the contents of AX and BX, sets flags for later use
    jl no_add ; if AX is smaller than BX, jump to the no_add label
    add ax, bx ; add BX to AX if its value is larger
    jmp mul_loop ; jump back to the mul_loop label to continue the multiplication

no_add:
    cmp dx, bx ; compare the contents of DX and BX, sets flags for later use
    jl no_shift ; if DX is smaller than BX, jump to the no_shift label
    adc dx, 0000h ; add 0000h (0) to DX, with carry from previous addition
    jmp mul_loop ; jump back to the mul_loop label to continue the multiplication

no_shift:
    jmp mul_loop ; jump back to the mul_loop label to continue the multiplication

end:
    mov ax, dx ; move the contents of DX to AX, this will clear the higher 16 bits of AX
    shl dx, 16 ; left shift DX by 16 bits
    or ax, dx ; bitwise OR to combine the contents of AX and DX, result will be stored in DX:AX

; The final result will be stored in DX:AX, with the lower 16 bits in AX and the higher 16 bits in DX
