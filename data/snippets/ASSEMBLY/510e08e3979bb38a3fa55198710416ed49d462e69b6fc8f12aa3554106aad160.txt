; Multiply two 8-bit numbers using 16-bit registers

ORG 100h ; set origin to 100h 

MOV AL, 8 ; move first number (8) to AL register 
MOV BL, 5 ; move second number (5) to BL register 

MUL BL ; multiply numbers in AL and BL, result stored in AX 

MOV CL, AL ; move lower 8 bits of result from AX to CL 
MOV AL, AH ; move higher 8 bits of result from AX to AL 

MOV AH, 0 ; clear AH register 
MOV BL, CL ; move lower 8 bits of result back to BL 

MUL BL ; multiply lower 8 bits of result with original second number 
ADD AX, CL ; add higher 8 bits of result (stored in CL) to 16-bit result in AX
