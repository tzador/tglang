; This code snippet is setting up a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
; It takes in one parameter, the number to calculate the factorial of, and the result is stored in the EAX register.

; Function to calculate the factorial of a number
calc_factorial:
    ; Set up the stack frame
    push ebp
    mov ebp, esp

    ; Move the parameter (number) from the stack into the ECX register
    mov ecx, [ebp + 8]

    ; Initialize the result variable to 1
    mov eax, 1

    ; Loop through the numbers from 1 to the input number
    mov ebx, 1       ; ebx will be our loop counter

factorial_loop:
    ; Multiply the current result by the loop counter
    mul ebx         ; eax = eax * ebx

    ; Increment the loop counter
    inc ebx

    ; Compare the loop counter to the input number
    cmp ebx, ecx

    ; If the loop counter is still less than or equal to the input number, continue looping
    jle factorial_loop

    ; Clean up the stack frame
    leave
    ret
