; This code snippet is a subroutine that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
fibonacci:
    ;input: r5 is the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate
    ;       r6 is the starting number (defaults to 0)
    ;output: r1 contains the last generated number in the sequence
    ;        r7 contains the current index in the sequence
    mov r0, r5      ; move input to r0
    cmp r0, #0      ; compare with 0 to see if there are any numbers to generate
    bne end         ; if input is 0, jump to end
    mov r7, r6      ; set current index to starting number
    mov r1, r6      ; initialize last generated number to starting number
loop:
    add r1, r1, r7  ; add last generated number to current index
    sub r7, #1      ; decrement current index
    cmp r7, #0      ; compare with 0 to see if we've reached the end of the sequence
    bne loop        ; if not, jump back to loop
end:
    ;return to subroutine
    bx lr           ; return last generated number in r1
