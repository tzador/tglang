global _start ; Makes _start label available to linker
_start: ; Defines the entry point of the program
    mov eax, 1 ; Moves the integer value 1 into the 'EAX' register
    mov ebx, 5 ; Moves the integer value 5 into the 'EBX' register
    add eax, ebx ; Adds the values in EAX and EBX registers and stores the result in EAX
    mov edx, 4 ; Moves the integer value 4 into the 'EDX' register
    int 0x80 ; Executes the system call to print the result
    mov eax, 1 ; Moves the integer value 1 into the 'EAX' register
    xor ebx, ebx ; Clears the value in the 'EBX' register
    int 0x80 ; Executes the system call to exit the program

; Output:

; EAX = 6 ; Contains the value 6, the result of 1 + 5
; EBX = 5 ; Contains the value 5 from the previous operation
; EDX = 4 ; Contains the value 4, used for system call

; Explanation:
; This code snippet uses the 'MOV' instruction to move values into registers,
; the 'ADD' instruction to perform addition, and the 'INT 0x80' instruction to execute system calls.
; Before exiting the program, the 'XOR' instruction is used to clear the value in the 'EBX' register.
