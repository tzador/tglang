/*
This code snippet creates a class for a Player object and defines methods for moving the player on a game board.

  - Generates a `Player` class with properties for `x` and `y` coordinates, `speed` and `size`  
  - Contains a constructor function that sets initial values for the properties  
  - Defines methods for moving the player up, down, left and right on the game board  
  - Includes a check for boundaries of the game board to prevent the player from going off-screen
