// This is a complex code snippet written in ACTIONSCRIPT
// It includes multiple variable declarations, conditional statements, and a for loop
// The output of this code is a series of numbers from 1 to 10, each multiplied by 2

// Variable declaration
var num1:int = 1;
var num2:int = 2;
var num3:int = 3;
var num4:int = 4;
var num5:int = 5;
var num6:int = 6;
var num7:int = 7;
var num8:int = 8;
var num9:int = 9;
var num10:int = 10;

// Conditional statement - if/else statement
if (num1 == 1) {
  trace("1 is the smallest number!");
}
else {
  trace("1 is not the smallest number.");
}

// For loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 10
for (var i:int = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  // Multiply current number (i) by 2 and store it in a variable
  var multiplied:int = i * 2;
  // Output the multiplied number
  trace("Number " + i + " multiplied by 2 is: " + multiplied);
}

// Expected output in console:
// 1 is the smallest number!
// Number 1 multiplied by 2 is: 2
// Number 2 multiplied by 2 is: 4
// Number 3 multiplied by 2 is: 6
// Number 4 multiplied by 2 is: 8
// Number 5 multiplied by 2 is: 10
// Number 6 multiplied by 2 is: 12
// Number 7 multiplied by 2 is: 14
// Number 8 multiplied by 2 is: 16
// Number 9 multiplied by 2 is: 18
// Number 10 multiplied by 2 is: 20
