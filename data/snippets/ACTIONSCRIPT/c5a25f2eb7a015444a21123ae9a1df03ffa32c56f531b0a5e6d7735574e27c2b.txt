// This code snippet is a basic implementation of a class in ActionScript.
// It contains properties and methods that demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts.

// Define a class named "Person"
class Person {
    // Define two properties: "name" and "age", both private and accessible only within the class.
    private var name:String;
    private var age:int;
    
    // Create a constructor that takes in two parameters: "name" and "age".
    public function Person(name:String, age:int) {
        // Set the values of the properties based on the parameters passed in.
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    // Define a method named "greet" that returns a String.
    public function greet():String {
        // Use string concatenation to create a greeting message that includes the person's name and age.
        return "Hello, my name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + " years old.";
    }
    
    // Define a method named "birthday" that does not return anything.
    public function birthday():void {
        // Increment the age property by 1.
        this.age++;
        // Print a message to the console indicating that the person's age has been updated.
        trace(this.name + "'s age has been updated to " + this.age + ".");
    }
}

// Instantiate a new object of the Person class with the name "John" and age 25.
var john:Person = new Person("John", 25);

// Call the "greet" method on the john object and print the result to the console.
trace(john.greet());

// Call the "birthday" method on the john object to update his age.
john.birthday();

// Call the "greet" method again to see the updated age reflected in the greeting.
trace(john.greet());

// Output:
// Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
// John's age has been updated to 26.
// Hello, my name is John and I am 26 years old.
