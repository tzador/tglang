/*
This code snippet creates and animates a MovieClip object on the stage, using properties, conditions, and event listeners. The object's x and y position, width, height, and alpha are set, and it is then added to the stage. A Tween object is created to animate the object's x position, with a delay of 1 second and 3 repetitions. An event listener is added to the Tween to listen for when the animation is complete, and a function is executed to change the object's properties once the tween is finished. The code then checks if the object's width is greater than 100 and changes its color to blue if the condition is met. Two for loops are used to animate the object's rotation using a new Tween object, and to change its color using a Timer object. Finally, an event listener is added to the object to remove it from the stage when clicked.
