/* This is a complex code snippet in ACTIONSCRIPT that demonstrates
how to create a function that takes in an array of numbers and
calculates their average. */

function calculateAverage(numbers:Array):Number{
    /* This function takes in an array of numbers and returns
    the average of those numbers as a single Number value. */

    var total:Number = 0;
    /* This variable will be used to keep track of the running total
    of all the numbers in the array. */

        /* This loop will iterate through each element in the array
        and add it to the total variable. */

        total += numbers[i];

    of elements in the array. */

// Example usage:
var numbers:Array = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
var result:Number = calculateAverage(numbers);
trace("The average of the numbers is: " + result);
// Output: The average of the numbers is: 6
