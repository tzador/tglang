//This code snippet is an example of an ActionScript class

//Creating the class
class Employee {

  //Defining properties
  var firstName:String;
  var lastName:String;
  var age:Number;
  var salary:Number;

  //Constructor function
  function Employee (first:String, last:String, age:Number, salary:Number) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  //Methods
  public function getFullName():String {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }

  public function getAge():Number {
    return this.age;
  }

  public function getSalary():String {

  //Static variables
  public static const companyName:String = "ABC Inc.";
  private static var totalEmployees:Number = 0;

  //Static methods
  public static function getTotalEmployees():Number {
    return totalEmployees;
  }

  //Static function to calculate average salary
  public static function getAverageSalary(...salaries):Number {
    //Sum of all salaries
    var totalSalary:Number = 0;
    //Loop through the provided salaries
    for each (var salary:Number in salaries) {
      //Add each salary to the total
      totalSalary += salary;
    }
    //Calculate the average salary by dividing the total by the number of employees
    return totalSalary / totalEmployees;
  }
}

//Creating instances of the class
var john:Employee = new Employee("John", "Doe", 25, 50000);
var jane:Employee = new Employee("Jane", "Smith", 30, 60000);

//Static variables and method can be accessed directly from the class
trace("Company Name: " + Employee.companyName);
trace("Total Employees: " + Employee.getTotalEmployees());

//Calling methods on the instances
trace(john.getFullName() + "'s age is " + john.getAge() + " and salary is $" + john.getSalary());
trace(jane.getFullName() + "'s age is " + jane.getAge() + " and salary is $" + jane.getSalary());

//Calling the static function to calculate average salary
var averageSalary:Number = Employee.getAverageSalary(john.getSalary(), jane.getSalary());
trace("Average Salary: $" + averageSalary);
