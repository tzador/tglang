//This is a complex code snippet in ActionScript
//It defines a class and its properties and methods

//Define the class with name 'Person'
class Person {
    
    //Define the properties of the class
    var name:String;
    var age:int;
    var gender:String;
    
    //Define the constructor function
    function Person(name:String, age:int, gender:String) {
        //Set the values for the properties
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.gender = gender;
    }
    
    //Define a method to introduce the person
    function introduce():void {
        //Print out a string with the person's information
        trace("Hello, my name is " + this.name + ", I am " + this.age + " years old and I identify as " + this.gender + ".");
    }
    
    //Define a method to calculate the person's age in dog years
    function calculateDogYears():int {
        //Calculate the age in dog years (assuming 1 dog year = 7 human years)
        var dogYears:int = this.age * 7;
        //Return the calculated value
        return dogYears;
    }
}

//Create an instance of the Person class with name, age and gender specified
var john:Person = new Person("John", 25, "male");

//Call the introduce method to introduce John
john.introduce();
// Output: Hello, my name is John, I am 25 years old and I identify as male.

//Call the calculateDogYears method to calculate John's age in dog years
var dogYears:int = john.calculateDogYears();
trace("John's age in dog years is " + dogYears);
// Output: John's age in dog years is 175
