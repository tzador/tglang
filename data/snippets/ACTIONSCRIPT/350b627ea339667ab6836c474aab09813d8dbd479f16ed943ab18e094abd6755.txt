//This code snippet is an example of a function in ActionScript that calculates the factorial of a given number.
function factorial(n:int):int{
    //Initializes a variable to store the factorial result
    var result:int = 1;
    //Checks if the given number is equal to 0 or 1, which would result in a factorial of 1
    if(n == 0 || n == 1){
        //Returns the result of 1
        return result;
    }
    //Iteratively multiplies the result by the current number and decreases the count to eventually reach 1
    for(var i:int = n; i > 1; i--){
        result *= i;
    }
    //Returns the final result of the factorial calculation
    return result;
