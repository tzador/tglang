// This code snippet shows an example of creating a class and using inheritance in ActionScript

// Creating the base class "Vehicle" with two properties and a method
class Vehicle {
  public var name:String;
  public var wheels:int;
  
  public function startEngine():void {
    trace("Engine started!");
  }
}

// Creating the subclass "Car" which inherits from the "Vehicle" class
class Car extends Vehicle {
  public var color:String;
  
  // Overriding the startEngine() method from the base class
  override public function startEngine():void {
    super.startEngine(); // Calls the startEngine() method from the base class first
    trace("Car engine started!");
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the "Car" class and accessing its properties and methods
var myCar:Car = new Car();
myCar.name = "Sports Car";
myCar.color = "Red";
myCar.wheels = 4;
myCar.startEngine(); // Outputs "Engine started!" and "Car engine started!" to the console
