/** 
 * The following code creates a constructor for a custom class called "Person".
 * The constructor takes in three parameters, "name", "age", and "gender", and assigns them to properties of the class.
 * The "toString()" method is also defined, printing out a sentence using the properties of the class.
 * This code showcases how class constructors and methods can be defined in ActionScript.
