//  This code snippet is a simplified implementation of a class in ActionScript.

/*  This class represents a fun example of a superhero, with properties for their name, powers, and their catchphrase. */

//  Define the class:
class Superhero {

    /*  Define the constructor function, which takes in arguments to set the properties of the class. */

    function Superhero(name:String, powers:Array, catchphrase:String) {
        //  Set the properties of the class to the arguments passed in.
        this.name = name;
        this.powers = powers;
        this.catchphrase = catchphrase;
    }

    /*  Define a function to introduce the superhero and their powers. */

    function introduce() {
        //  Print out the name of the superhero.
        trace("I am " + this.name + "!");

        //  Print out the list of powers.
        trace("My powers include:");

        //  Loop through the array of powers and print each one out.
        for each(var power:String in this.powers) {
            trace(power);
        }

        //  Print out the catchphrase of the superhero.
        trace("My catchphrase is: " + this.catchphrase);
    }
}

//  Create an instance of the Superhero class, passing in the necessary arguments.
var spiderman:Superhero = new Superhero("Spiderman", ["spider-like abilities", "superhuman strength", "web-slinging"], "With great power comes great responsibility!");

//  Call the introduce function on the instance of the Superhero class.
spiderman.introduce();

/*
Expected output:

I am Spiderman!
My powers include:
spider-like abilities
superhuman strength
web-slinging
My catchphrase is: With great power comes great responsibility!
