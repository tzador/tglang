// This code snippet is a complex function that computes the average score of a group of students.
function computeAverageScore(studentScores:Array):Number {
    // Declaring variables to store the sum of scores and the number of students
    var sum:Number = 0;
    var numStudents:Number = studentScores.length;

    // Looping through the array of student scores using the "for" loop
    for (var i:int = 0; i < numStudents; i++) {
        // Adding each score to the sum variable
        sum += studentScores[i];
    }

    // Calculating the average by dividing the sum by the number of students
    var average:Number = sum / numStudents;

    // Returning the average as the output of the function
    return average;
}

// Example: Computing the average score of a group of students
var scores:Array = [85, 92, 78, 90, 84];
var averageScore:Number = computeAverageScore(scores);
trace(averageScore); // Output: 85.8
