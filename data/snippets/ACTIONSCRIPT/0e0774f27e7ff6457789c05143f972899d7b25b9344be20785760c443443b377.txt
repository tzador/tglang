//Documentation: This code snippet demonstrates the creation of a dynamic class in ActionScript

//Create a dynamic class named "Car"
dynamic class Car {
    //Define properties of the car
    public var make:String;
    public var model:String;
    public var year:int;
    public var color:String;

    //Constructor function
    function Car(make:String, model:String, year:int, color:String) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
        this. color = color;
    }
}

//Create an instance of the Car class
var myCar:Car = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2015, "red");

//Access and modify properties
trace("My car is a " + myCar.color + " " + myCar.make + " " + myCar.model + " from " + myCar.year);
myCar.color = "blue";
myCar.year = 2020;

//Add a new dynamic function
myCar.drive = function() {
    trace("Driving my " + this.make + " " + this.model + " now!");
}

//Call the new function
myCar.drive();
