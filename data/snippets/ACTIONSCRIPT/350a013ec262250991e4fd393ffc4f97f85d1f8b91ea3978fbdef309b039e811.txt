// This code snippet is a complex and long function
// It takes in an array of numbers and returns the average of all the values
function calculateAverage(numbers:Array):Number { // Creates a function called calculateAverage that takes in an array of numbers and returns a number
  var sum:Number = 0; // Creates a variable called sum and initializes it to 0
  var average:Number; // Creates a variable called average without initializing it

  for (var i:int = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) { // Creates a for loop that starts at 0 and executes until it reaches the length of the array
    sum += numbers[i]; // Adds the value at the current index of the array to the sum variable
  }

  average = sum / numbers.length; // Calculates the average by dividing the sum by the length of the array and assigns it to the average variable

  return average; // Returns the calculated average
} // Ends the function

// Example usage:
var numbersArr:Array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]; // Creates an array with 5 numbers
var result:Number = calculateAverage(numbersArr); // Calls the calculateAverage function with the numbersArr array and assigns the returned average value to the result variable

trace(result); // Outputs the calculated average to the console (in this case, 5)
