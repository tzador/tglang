// This code snippet creates a class with a constructor, public variables, private variables, and a public method.

// The class name is "Person" and it will have two public variables - name and age.
public class Person {
    public var name:String;
    public var age:int;

    // The constructor will take in two parameters - name and age, and set them to the respective public variables.
    public function Person(name:String, age:int) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // This is a private variable that will hold a count of the number of Person objects created.
    private static var count:int = 0;

    // This is a public method that will increment the count variable by one and return the count.
    public function increaseCount():int {
        count++;
        return count;
    }
}

// Instantiating a new Person object with the name "John" and age 25.
var person:Person = new Person("John", 25);

// Calling the increaseCount() method on the person object.
person.increaseCount(); // This will output 1.

// Instantiating another Person object with the name "Jane" and age 30.
var anotherPerson:Person = new Person("Jane", 30);

// Calling the increaseCount() method on the anotherPerson object.
anotherPerson.increaseCount(); // This will output 2.
