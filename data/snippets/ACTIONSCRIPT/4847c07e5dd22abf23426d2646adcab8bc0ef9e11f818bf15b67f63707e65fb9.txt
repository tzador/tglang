// This is a complex code snippet written in Actionscript
// It has multiple variables, loops and conditional statements

// Create a variable to store the name of a user
var username:String = "John";

// Create a variable to store the user's age
var age:int = 25;

// Create an array to store the user's favorite hobbies
var hobbies:Array = ["reading", "cooking", "playing guitar"];

// Use a loop to print out the user's hobbies
for(var i:int = 0; i < hobbies.length; i++){
  trace("One of " +username + "'s hobbies is " + hobbies[i]);
}

// Create a conditional statement to check if the user is over 18
if(age > 18){
  trace(username + " is over 18 years old.");
} else {
  trace(username + " is under 18 years old.");
}

// Create a function to calculate the user's birth year

}

// Call the function to calculate the user's birth year
var birthYear:int = calculateBirthYear(2021, age);

// Print out the user's birth year
trace(username + "'s birth year is " + birthYear);

// Create a class to represent a book
