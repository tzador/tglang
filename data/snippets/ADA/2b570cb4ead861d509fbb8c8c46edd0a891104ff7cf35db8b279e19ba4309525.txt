-- This is a procedure that performs bitwise AND operation on two input integers
procedure Bitwise_AND (Num1 : in Integer; Num2 : in Integer; AND_Result : out Integer) is
begin
    AND_Result := Num1 and Num2; -- use 'and' keyword for bitwise AND operation

    -- check if the result is greater than 100
    if AND_Result > 100 then
        AND_Result := 100; -- set result to 100 if it is greater
    end if;
end Bitwise_AND;

-- Example usage:
-- Perform bitwise AND operation on 32 and 63
-- Print the result
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
procedure Main is
    AND_Result : Integer; -- variable to store the result
begin
    -- call the procedure and pass in 32 and 63 as inputs
    Bitwise_AND(32, 63, AND_Result);

    Put_Line("Result of bitwise AND on 32 and 63 is: " & AND_Result'Image & " (decimal value: " & AND_Result'Img & ")"); -- print the result, 'Image and 'Img are used to convert the integer to string for printing
end Main;

-- Output:
-- Result of bitwise AND on 32 and 63 is: 00000000000000000000000000100000 (decimal value: 32)
