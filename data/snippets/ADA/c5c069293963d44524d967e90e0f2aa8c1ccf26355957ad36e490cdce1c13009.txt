function factorial(x : Positive) return Natural is
    -- This function calculates the factorial of a positive integer
    -- and returns the result as a natural number.
    -- Precondition: x must be a positive integer
    -- Postcondition: the result must be equal to the factorial of x
    
    factorial : Natural := 1; -- variable to store the factorial value
    
    begin
        for i in 2..x loop -- loop through all numbers from 2 to x
            factorial := factorial * i; -- multiply the current factorial value by the next number in the loop
        end loop;
        
        return factorial; -- return the final factorial value
    end factorial;
