-- Declare a record type for a person
type Person is record
    Name : String(1..50);
    Age : Integer range 1..120;
    Address : String(1..100);
end record;

-- Declare an array of 10 Person records
type People_Array is array (1..10) of Person;

-- Initialize the array with empty records
People : People_Array := (others => (Name => "", Age => 0, Address => ""));

-- Assign values to the first record
People(1).Name := "John";
People(1).Age := 25;
People(1).Address := "123 Main Street";

-- Loop through the array and print out the information for each person
for i in 1..10 loop
    put_line(People(i).Name & " is " & People(i).Age'Image & " years old and lives at " & People(i).Address);
end loop;

-- Output:
-- John is 25 years old and lives at 123 Main Street
-- (for the remaining records, the output will be blank since we initialized them with empty values)
