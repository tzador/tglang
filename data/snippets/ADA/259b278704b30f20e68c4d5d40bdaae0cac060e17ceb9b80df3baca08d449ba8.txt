-- This is a complex and annotated code snippet in ADA

-- Declare a record type named "Employee"
-- This record has three fields:
-- "name" of type String
-- "age" of type Integer
-- "job_title" of type String
type Employee is record
    name : String(1..100);
    age : Integer range 18..80;
    job_title : String(1..50);
end record;

-- Declare a variable named "company" of type array of Employee with 3 elements
-- This will represent the employees of a company
company : array(1..3) of Employee;

-- Initialize the elements of the "company" array
-- This will add 3 employees to the company
company(1) := ("John Smith", 25, "Software Engineer");
company(2) := ("Emily Brown", 32, "Marketing Manager");
company(3) := ("David Lee", 40, "Project Manager");

-- Create a subprogram named "print_employee"
-- This subprogram takes in an employee record as input and prints out their information
procedure print_employee(emp : Employee) is
begin
    put_line("Employee name: " & emp.name);
    put_line("Employee age: " & emp.age'Image);
    put_line("Employee job title: " & emp.job_title);
end print_employee;

-- Call the "print_employee" subprogram for each employee in the "company" array
for i in company'Range loop
    print_employee(company(i));
end loop;

-- Output:
-- Employee name: John Smith
-- Employee age: 25
-- Employee job title: Software Engineer
-- Employee name: Emily Brown
-- Employee age: 32
-- Employee job title: Marketing Manager
-- Employee name: David Lee
-- Employee age: 40
-- Employee job title: Project Manager
