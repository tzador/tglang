-- Define a new type called "Color" which can be either "RED", "GREEN", or "BLUE"
type Color is ("RED", "GREEN", "BLUE");

-- Define a record type called "Point" which contains an x and y coordinate of type integer
type Point is record
    x : Integer;
    y : Integer;
end record;

-- Declare a constant color variable called "my_color" and assign it the value "BLUE"
my_color : Color := "BLUE";

-- Declare an array of points of size 10
points : array (1..10) of Point;

-- Iterate through the points array and assign x and y coordinates
for i in 1..10 loop
    points(i).x := i;    -- Assign x coordinate
    points(i).y := i * 10;    -- Assign y coordinate
end loop;
