-- This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number recursively
function factorial(n : positive) return positive is
    -- Base case, if n is 0 then factorial is 1
    if n = 0 then
        return 1;
    else
        -- Recursive call to calculate factorial of n - 1
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
