-- This is a program that finds the factorial of a number
with Ada.Text_IO;  -- Importing the Text_IO package for input/output operations

procedure Factorial is  -- Defining the main procedure
   Num : Integer;  -- Creating a variable to store the number
   Fact : Integer := 1;  -- Creating a variable to store the factorial and assigning it an initial value of 1
begin  -- Beginning of the program
   Ada.Text_IO.Put("Enter a number: ");  -- Prompting the user to input a number
   Ada.Text_IO.Get(Num);  -- Reading the input and storing it in the variable Num
   for I in 1..Num loop  -- Looping from 1 to the entered number
      Fact := Fact * I;  -- Calculating the factorial by multiplying with the loop counter
   end loop;  -- End of loop
