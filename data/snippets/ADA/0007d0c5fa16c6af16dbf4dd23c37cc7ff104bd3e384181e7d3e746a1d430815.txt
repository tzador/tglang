-- This code snippet uses the 'Record' data type and 'Loop' control structure in ADA.
-- Record data type allows us to create user-defined data structures.
-- Loop control structure allows us to perform repetitive tasks.

-- Define a record type representing a student's information
type Student is record
Name: String(1..20); -- Name can have a maximum of 20 characters
Age: Integer range 18..25; -- Age must be between 18 and 25
Gender: Boolean; -- True for male, False for female
Major: enum (Computer_Science, Engineering, Business, Other); -- Major can only be one of the given options
GPA: Float range 0.0..4.0; -- GPA must be between 0.0 and 4.0
end record;

-- Declare an array of students
Students: array(1..10) of Student;

-- Loop through the array and add student information
for i in 1..10 loop
Students(i).Name := "John Smith";
Students(i).Age := 20;
Students(i).Gender := True;
Students(i).Major := Computer_Science;
Students(i).GPA := 3.5;
end loop;

-- Print out the student information
for i in 1..10 loop
Put_Line(Students(i).Name & " is a " & (if Students(i).Gender then "male" else "female") & " studying " & Students(i).Major & " with a GPA of " & Float'Image(Students(i).GPA));
end loop;
