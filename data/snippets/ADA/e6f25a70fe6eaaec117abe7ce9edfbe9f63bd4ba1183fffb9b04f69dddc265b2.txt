-- This is a procedure for calculating the factorial of a given number
procedure Factorial (Number : Natural; Result : out Natural) is
    -- Input:
    --     Number - number whose factorial is to be calculated
    -- Output:
    --     Factorial of the given number
    begin

        for i in 1 .. Number loop
            Result := Result * i;
