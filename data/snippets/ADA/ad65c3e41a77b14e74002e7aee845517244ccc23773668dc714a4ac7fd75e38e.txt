-- This is a complex code snippet in ADA that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number

-- Create a function factorial that takes in a positive integer and returns its factorial
function factorial(num : positive) return positive is
-- Declare a local variable result to store the factorial value
    result : positive := 1;
begin
    -- If the number is 0 or 1, return the value 1 as 0! and 1! both equal 1
    if num = 0 or num = 1 then
        return result;
    else
        -- Use recursion to calculate the factorial value by reducing the number by 1
        return num * factorial(num - 1);
    end if;
end factorial;

-- Call the factorial function and store the result in a variable
fact_num : positive := factorial(5);

-- Print the result to the screen
put("The factorial of 5 is: " & fact_num);
