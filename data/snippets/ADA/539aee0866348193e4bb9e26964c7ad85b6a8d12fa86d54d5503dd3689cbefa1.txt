-- STRUCTURE DEFINITIONS --
-------------------------
-- This is a complex code snippet that defines several data structures in the ADA programming language. Each structure has different attributes and is used for different purposes.

-- Declaration of a record-type structure with multiple attributes
type Employee is record
    Name : String (1 .. 50); -- Name of the employee stored as a string of characters
    Age  : Natural range 18 .. 65; -- Age of the employee stored as a number between 18 and 65
    Salary : Float; -- Salary of the employee stored as a floating point number
    Department : String (1 .. 50); -- Department of the employee stored as a string of characters
end record;

-- Declaration of an enumeration-type structure
type Day_of_Week is (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday); -- Enumeration of days of the week

-- Declaration of an array-type structure
type Matrix is array (1 .. 10, 1 .. 10) of Integer; -- 10 by 10 integer matrix

-- Declaration of a variant-record-type structure
type Vehicle is record
    case Vehicle_Type is  -- Variant based on type of vehicle
        when Car => -- Attributes for a car
            Wheels : Integer range 2 .. 6;
            Engine_type : String (1 .. 10);
            Fuel_type : String (1 .. 10);
        when Motorcycle => -- Attributes for a motorcycle
            Wheels : Integer range 2 .. 3;
            Engine_type : String (1 .. 10);
            Fuel_type : String (1 .. 10);
        when Truck => -- Attributes for a truck
            Wheels : Integer range 4 .. 18;
            Engine_type : String (1 .. 10);
            Fuel_type : String (1 .. 10);
        when others => Null; -- No attributes for other types of vehicles
    end case;
end record;
