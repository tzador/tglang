-- This is a complex code snippet in ADA
Procedure Fibonacci (N : Positive) is  -- Function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to N
   Result : array (1..N) of Integer := (1, 1);
   -- Initializing the first two elements of the array to 1
Begin
   for i in 3 .. N loop
   -- Starting the loop from 3 because the first two elements are already initialized
      Result (i) := Result(i-1) + Result(i-2);
      -- Calculating the next element based on the previous two elements
   end loop;
   Put_Line("The Fibonacci sequence up to " & N & " is:");
   -- Printing the results to the console
   for i in 1 .. N loop
      Put(Result(i) & " ");
      -- Outputting the elements of the array in a single line
   end loop;
End Fibonacci;
-- Calling the function with a positive integer as input
Fibonacci(10);
