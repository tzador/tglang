-- This is a code snippet in ADA, which is a robust, strongly-typed programming language used for developing large and complex systems.
-- The following code snippet is a function that performs factorial calculation using recursion.

function Factorial(N : Integer) return Integer is
-- This function takes in an integer N and returns the factorial value as an integer.
begin
  if N = 0 or N = 1 then
-- Factorial of 0 and 1 are 1.
    return 1;
  else
-- For any other value of N, the function recursively calls itself to calculate the factorial.
    return N * Factorial(N-1);
  end if;
end Factorial;
