-- This is a sample of a complex code snippet written in ADA programming language

-- Declare an array of type Integer with 10 elements
type Int_Array is array(1..10) of Integer;

-- Declare a variable to hold the total sum of the elements in the array
Sum : Integer;

-- Loop through the array and calculate the sum of all the elements
for Index in Int_Array'range loop
    Sum := Sum + Int_Array(Index);
end loop;

-- Output the sum to the console
put("Total sum of array elements: ");
put(Sum);
