-- This is an example of a function in ADA language that computes the factorial of a given number
-- Input: num - integer representing the number whose factorial is to be computed
-- Output: fact - integer representing the factorial of the given number

function Factorial (num: integer) return integer is
  fact: integer := 1; -- initializing fact variable to store the factorial value
begin
  for i in 1..num loop
    fact := fact * i; -- calculating factorial by multiplying with previous value
  end loop;
  return fact; -- returning the factorial value
end Factorial;
