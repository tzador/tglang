-- This is a complex code snippet in ADA that creates a record type and performs operations on it

-- Define the record type "Student" with two fields: name (string) and grade (integer)
type Student is record
    name : String(1..50);
    grade : Integer;
end record;

-- Create an array of students with a maximum size of 10
type Student_Array is array (1..10) of Student;

-- Create a procedure to add a new student to the array and return the updated array
procedure Add_Student (new_student : in Student; student_list : in Student_Array; new_list : out Student_Array) is
    begin
            for i in student_list'range loop
                if student_list(i).name = "" then
                    student_list(i) := new_student;
                    new_list := student_list;
                    exit;
                end if;
            end loop;
end Add_Student;

-- Initialize an empty student array
Students : Student_Array;

-- Add a new student "John" with a grade of 95 to the array
New_Student : Student := (name => "John", grade => 95);
Add_Student (new_student => New_Student, student_list => Students, new_list => Students);

-- Print out the name and grade of the first student in the array
put("First student - Name: " & Students(1).name & " Grade: " & Students(1).grade);
