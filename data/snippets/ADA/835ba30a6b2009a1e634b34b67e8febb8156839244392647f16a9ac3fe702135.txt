-- This is an example of a complex code snippet in ADA

-- declare a record type to hold employee information
type Employee is record
    Name: String(1..50);
    Age: Integer;
    Department: String(1..20);
    Salary: Float;
end record;

-- declare a new employee record
employee1: Employee;

-- assign values to the record fields
employee1.Name := "John Doe";
employee1.Age := 35;
employee1.Department := "IT";
employee1.Salary := 5000.00;

--create a function to calculate bonus based on employee salary
function CalculateBonus(salary: Float) return Float is
begin
    if salary < 10000.00 then
        return salary * 0.10; -- 10% bonus for lower salaries
    else
        return salary * 0.15; -- 15% bonus for higher salaries
    end if;
end CalculateBonus;

-- call the function to calculate employee1's bonus and assign it to a variable
bonus: Float := CalculateBonus(employee1.Salary);

-- display the employee information and bonus
