-- This is a procedure that takes in an integer parameter
procedure Factorial (num : in Integer) is
    -- This variable will store the result
    fac_result : Integer := 1;

    -- This loop will iterate from 1 to the input number
    for i in 1..num loop
        -- This code multiplies the current result with the current number
        fac_result := fac_result * i;
    end loop;

    -- This is a conditional statement to check if the input was 0
    if num = 0 then
        -- If the input was 0, the result will be 1
        fac_result := 1;
    end if;
end Factorial;

-- This is an example of calling the Factorial procedure and storing the result in a variable
N : Integer := 5; -- Input number
result : Integer := Factorial (N); -- Calling the Factorial procedure and passing in the input number
