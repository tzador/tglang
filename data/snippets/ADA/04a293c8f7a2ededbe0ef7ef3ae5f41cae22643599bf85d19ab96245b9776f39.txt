-- This is a code snippet written in ADA
-- It calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion

-- This is the factorial function defined in ADA
function factorial(n : natural) return natural is
begin
    if n = 0 then -- Base case: when n is 0, factorial is 1
        return 1;
    else
        return n * factorial(n-1); -- Recursive case: multiply n by factorial of (n-1)
    end if;
end factorial;

-- Declare a variable to store the number whose factorial we want to find
number : natural := 5;

-- Call the factorial function with the given number as input
factorialOfNumber := factorial(number);

-- Display the result
put_line("Factorial of " & number & " is " & factorialOfNumber & ".");
