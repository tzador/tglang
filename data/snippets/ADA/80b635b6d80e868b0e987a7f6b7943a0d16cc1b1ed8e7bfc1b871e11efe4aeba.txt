-- This code snippet shows an example of a custom type declaration and a function that uses it

-- Create a custom type called "Student" that has three components
type Student is record
    id : Integer;
    name : String (1 .. 20);  -- String with maximum length of 20 characters
    grade : Float;  -- Grade is a floating point number
end record;

-- Function to calculate the average grade of a list of students
function calculate_average_grade(students : Student_Array) return Float is
    total : Float := 0.0;  -- Variable to store the total sum of grades
    num_students : Integer := students'Length;  -- Get the number of students
begin
    for i in students'Range loop
        total := total + students(i).grade;  -- Add each student's grade to the total
    end loop;

    return total / num_students;  -- Calculate and return the average grade
end calculate_average_grade;

-- Example usage of the function
declare
    -- Create an array of 5 students
    students : Student_Array (1 .. 5);
    -- Initialize each student's information
    student_1 : Student := (id => 1, name => "John", grade => 89.5);
    student_2 : Student := (id => 2, name => "Jane", grade => 95.2);
    student_3 : Student := (id => 3, name => "Bob", grade => 78.9);
    student_4 : Student := (id => 4, name => "Samantha", grade => 87.4);
    student_5 : Student := (id => 5, name => "Michael", grade => 92.1);
begin
    -- Add each student to the array
    students(1) := student_1;
    students(2) := student_2;
    students(3) := student_3;
    students(4) := student_4;
    students(5) := student_5;

    -- Call the function and store the result in a variable
    avg_grade : Float := calculate_average_grade(students);

    -- Print the result
    Put_Line("The average grade is: " & Float'Image(avg_grade));
end;
