-- This is an example of a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
-- Taken from the official Ada website: https://learn.adacore.com/courses/learn-spark-with-alire/

-- This is the function definition, taking an integer parameter and returning an integer
function Factorial (N : in Integer) return Integer is
   -- This is a local variable used to store the result
   Result : Integer := 1;
begin
   -- This loop calculates the factorial by multiplying the numbers from 1 to N
   for i in 1..N loop
      Result := Result * i;
   end loop;
   
   -- The result is returned after the loop is finished
   return Result;
end Factorial;

-- This is an example of calling the function and printing the result
put("The factorial of 5 is: ");
put_line(Integer'Image(Factorial(5))); -- 'Image is a conversion function that converts an Integer to a string for printing

-- Output: The factorial of 5 is: 120
