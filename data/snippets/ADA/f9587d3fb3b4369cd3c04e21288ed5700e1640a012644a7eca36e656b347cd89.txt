-- Function to calculate the factorial of a number

function Factorial(n : Positive) return Natural is
-- This function takes in a positive integer and returns its factorial as a natural number.

fact : Natural := 1; -- Initialize the variable to hold the factorial

begin -- Start of the function
	for i in 1..n loop -- Loop through the numbers from 1 to n
		fact := fact * i; -- Update the factorial by multiplying with the current number
	end loop;

	return fact; -- Return the factorial as the output
end Factorial;
