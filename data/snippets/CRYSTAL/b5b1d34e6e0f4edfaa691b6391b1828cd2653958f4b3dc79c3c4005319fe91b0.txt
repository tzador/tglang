# This code snippet shows how to create a class in CRYSTAL that uses inheritance and has different methods and attributes

# Create a parent class called Vehicle
class Vehicle
  # Define the initialize method that takes in two attributes: color and year
  def initialize(@color : String, @year : Int32)
  end

  # Define the accelerate method that prints a message
  def accelerate
    puts "Vehicle is accelerating!"
  end
end

# Create a child class called Car that inherits from Vehicle
class Car < Vehicle
  # Define the initialize method that initializes the attributes from the parent class and adds a new attribute, brand
  def initialize(color, year, @brand : String)
    super(color, year)
  end

  # Define the honk method that prints a honking message
  def honk
    puts "Beep beep!"
  end
end

# Create an instance of Car with a red color, year 2020, and brand "Ford"
car = Car.new("red", 2020, "Ford")

# Call the accelerate method on the car instance
car.accelerate # Output: Vehicle is accelerating!

# Call the honk method on the car instance
car.honk # Output: Beep beep!
