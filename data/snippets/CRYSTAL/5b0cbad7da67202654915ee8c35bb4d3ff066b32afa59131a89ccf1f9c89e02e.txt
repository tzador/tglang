# Declare a constant variable named "PI" and assign it the value 3.14
# The type of the variable will be inferred from the value provided
PI = 3.14

# Declare a function named "calculate_area" that takes two arguments: "radius" and "height" of type Float32
# The function returns the calculated area of a cylinder
# The return type will be inferred from the last expression in the function
def calculate_area(radius : Float32, height : Float32)
  # Calculate the base area of the cylinder by multiplying PI with the square of the radius
  base_area = PI * radius * radius
  
  # Calculate the lateral area of the cylinder by multiplying the circumference with the height
  lateral_area = 2 * PI * radius * height
  
  # Calculate the final area by adding the base area and lateral area
  base_area + lateral_area
end

# Call the function and pass in a radius of 5.0 and height of 10.0 as arguments
calculate_area(5.0, 10.0) # Outputs 314.0 (which is the area of a cylinder with radius of 5.0 and height of 10.0)
