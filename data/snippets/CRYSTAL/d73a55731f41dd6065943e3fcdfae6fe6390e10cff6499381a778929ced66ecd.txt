# This is a simple recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number

# Takes in a number and iteratively multiplies it by all the numbers below it until 1
def factorial(n : Int32) : Int32
   # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return 1
   if n == 0 || n == 1
      # Return 1
      return 1
   else
      # Recursive case: multiply n by the factorial of n-1
      return n * factorial(n - 1)
   end
end

# Print the factorial of 5
factorial(5) # => 120
# The output of this code snippet will be 120, as the factorial of 5 is 120
