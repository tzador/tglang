# This is a complex code snippet in the CRYSTAL programming language.

# First, we define a class called 'Person' with two properties: 'name' and 'age'.
class Person
  # Define the 'name' property and initialize it to an empty string.
  property name : String = ""
  # Define the 'age' property and initialize it to 0.
  property age : Int32 = 0
end

# Next, we create a method called 'say_hello' which takes in a 'Person' object as a parameter.
def say_hello(person : Person)
  # Print out a greeting using the 'name' property of the 'Person' object.
  puts "Hello #{person.name}!"
end

# Now, we create two instances of the 'Person' class.
person1 = Person.new
person2 = Person.new

# Set the 'name' and 'age' properties of person1.
person1.name = "John"
person1.age = 30

# Set the 'name' and 'age' properties of person2.
person2.name = "Jane"
person2.age = 25

# Call the 'say_hello' method for both person1 and person2.
say_hello(person1)
say_hello(person2)

# Output:
# Hello John!
# Hello Jane!
