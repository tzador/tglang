# This is a code snippet in Crystal programming language.
# It includes a complex data structure, function, and loop.
# The output is a greeting for a list of names.
 
struct Person
  # Struct called Person with two fields, name and age
  name : String
  age : Int32
end

# Function called greeting that takes in a list of Person structs
def greeting(list : Array(Person))
  # Loop through the list and print a greeting for each person
  for person in list
    puts "Hello #{person.name}, you are #{person.age} years old!"
  end
end

# Create an array of Person structs
people = [
  Person.new(name: "John", age: 20),
  Person.new(name: "Jane", age: 25),
  Person.new(name: "Bob", age: 30)
]

# Call the greeting function with the array of people as the argument
greeting(people)

# Output:
# Hello John, you are 20 years old!
# Hello Jane, you are 25 years old!
# Hello Bob, you are 30 years old!
