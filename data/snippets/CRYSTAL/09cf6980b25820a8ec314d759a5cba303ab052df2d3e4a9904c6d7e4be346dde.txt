# This is a function that checks if a given number is prime or not
fun is_prime(number : Int) : Bool
  # First, we check if the number is less than 2 since 2 is the smallest prime number
  if number < 2
    return false
  end
 
  # Next, we iterate through all numbers from 2 to half of the given number
  for i in 2..number/2
    # If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, then it is not prime
    if number % i == 0
      return false
    end
  end
 
  # If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is prime
  return true
end
 
# Example usage
puts is_prime(17) # Output: true
puts is_prime(24) # Output: false
