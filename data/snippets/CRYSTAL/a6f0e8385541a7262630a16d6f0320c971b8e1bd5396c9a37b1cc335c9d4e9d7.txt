# This is a complex code snippet in CRYSTAL

# Defining a method that takes in a string parameter
def hello(str : String)
  # Creating a new empty array
  greeting = [] of String
  # Iterating through each character
  for char in str.chars
    # Multiplying the character by 2 and adding it to the array
    greeting << char * 2
  end
  # Returning the now modified string
  return greeting.join
end

# Calling the method with the parameter "Hello"
hello("Hello") # => "HHeelllloo"

# Defining a class called Person
class Person
  # Initializing with name and age as parameters
  def initialize(@name, @age)
  end
  
  # Defining a method to concatenate the name and age and return the result
  def introduce
    return "Hi, my name is #@name and I am #@age years old."
  end
end

# Creating a new instance of the Person class
person = Person.new("John", 25)

# Printing the result of calling the introduce method on the person object
puts person.introduce # => "Hi, my name is John and I am 25 years old."
