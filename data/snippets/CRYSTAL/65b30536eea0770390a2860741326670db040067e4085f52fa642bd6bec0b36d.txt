# This program calculates the average of an array of numbers

# Define an array of numbers
numbers = [3, 5, 7, 2, 9, 11]

# Define a variable to store the sum of all numbers
sum = 0

# Loop through the array and add each number to the sum
for num in numbers
    sum += num
end

# Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of numbers in the array
average = sum / numbers.length

# Print the average
puts "The average of the numbers in the array is #{average}"
