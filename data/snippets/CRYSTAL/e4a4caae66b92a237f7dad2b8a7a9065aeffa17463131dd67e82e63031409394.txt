# This is a complex code snippet in Crystal programming language.
# It contains a function, a loop, and multiple variables.

# Defining a function called "sum" with two parameters, a and b, which returns an Integer.
def sum(a : Int32, b : Int32) : Int32
  # Initializing variable "total" to hold the final sum.
  total = 0
  # Using a loop to add numbers from a to b and update "total" with the sum.
  while a <= b
    total += a
    a += 1
  end
  # Returning the "total" variable as the result of the function.
  total
end

# Calling the "sum" function with arguments 1 and 10, and assigning the result to variable "result".
result = sum(1, 10)

# Printing the final result.
puts "The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is #{result}."

# Output:
# The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is 55.
