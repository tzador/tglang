# This code uses a for loop to iterate through an array and return a new array with only even numbers

# Define the array
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Instantiate the new array
even_numbers = []

# Loop through the array
for num in numbers do
  # Check if the number is even
  if num % 2 == 0
    # Add the even number to the new array
    even_numbers.push(num)
  end
end

# Output the new array
puts even_numbers

# Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
