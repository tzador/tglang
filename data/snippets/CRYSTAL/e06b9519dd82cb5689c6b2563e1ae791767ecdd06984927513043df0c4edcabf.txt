# Define a class named "Person" with three properties:
# - name: a string
# - age: an integer
# - occupation: a string
class Person
  # An instance variable to store the name of the person
  @name : String

  # An instance variable to store the age of the person
  @age : Int32

  # An instance variable to store the occupation of the person
  @occupation : String

  # This is a getter method for the name property
  #
  # Example usage:
  # person = Person.new("John", 30, "Engineer")
  # person.name #=> "John"
  def name
    return @name
  end

  # This is a getter method for the age property
  #
  # Example usage:
  # person = Person.new("John", 30, "Engineer")
  # person.age #=> 30
  def age
    return @age
  end

  # This is a getter method for the occupation property
  #
  # Example usage:
  # person = Person.new("John", 30, "Engineer")
  # person.occupation #=> "Engineer"
  def occupation
    return @occupation
  end

  # This is a setter method for the name property
  #
  # Example usage:
  # person = Person.new("John", 30, "Engineer")
  # person.name = "Jane"
  # person.name #=> "Jane"
  def name=(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end

  # This is a setter method for the age property
  #
  # Example usage:
  # person = Person.new("John", 30, "Engineer")
  # person.age = 40
  # person.age #=> 40
  def age=(new_age)
    @age = new_age
  end

  # This is a setter method for the occupation property
  #
  # Example usage:
  # person = Person.new("John", 30, "Engineer")
  # person.occupation = "Doctor"
  # person.occupation #=> "Doctor"
  def occupation=(new_occupation)
    @occupation = new_occupation
  end
end

# Instantiate a new instance of the Person class with default values
person = Person.new("John Doe", 25, "Student")

# Access the properties of the person object
person.name #=> "John Doe"
person.age #=> 25
person.occupation #=> "Student"

# Change the properties of the person object using the setter methods
person.name = "Jane Smith"
person.age = 30
person.occupation = "Teacher"

# Check if the properties were successfully changed
person.name #=> "Jane Smith"
person.age #=> 30
person.occupation #=> "Teacher"
