# Define a method called multiply that takes in two arguments, a and b
def multiply(a, b)
  # Define a variable called result and set it to 0
  result = 0
  # Loop through the range of b using a for loop
  for i in 1..b do
    # Increment result by a
    result += a
  end
  # Return the result
  return result
end

# Set variable x to 5
x = 5
# Set variable y to 10
y = 10

# Call the multiply method and pass in x and y as arguments
# Assign the returned result to variable z
z = multiply(x, y)

# Print the value of z
puts z
