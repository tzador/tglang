# Define a function that takes in two variables of type Int32 and returns their product 
# Note: all variables in CRYSTAL are mutable by default
func multiply(x : Int32, y : Int32) : Int32 
    return x * y 
end 

# Define a new class called Person with properties name and age 
class Person
    # Define variables within the class
    property name : String 
    property age : Int32 

    # Create a constructor that takes in the name and age 
    def initialize(@name, @age)
    end 

    # Define a method that returns the person's name and age 
    def get_name_and_age 
        return "#{@name} is #{@age} years old."
    end
end 

# Create a new instance of the Person class with name "John" and age 30
person = Person.new("John", 30)

# Call the get_name_and_age method on the person instance
puts person.get_name_and_age 

# Output: "John is 30 years old."
