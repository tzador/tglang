# This is a complex code snippet in CRYSTAL, demonstrating various concepts and syntax in the language.

# Defining a class with a constructor, properties, and methods
class Person
  # Name property with a default value
  property name : String = "John Doe"
  # Age property with a default value
  property age : Int32 = 30

  # Constructor that takes in name and age parameters
  def initialize(@name : String, @age : Int32)
    # @ symbol denotes an instance variable
    @name = name
    # @ symbol can also be omitted, as shown with @age
  end

  # Method that prints out the person's details
  def describe
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Creating an instance of the Person class
john_doe = Person.new("John Doe", 30)

# Calling the describe method on the john_doe instance
john_doe.describe

# Output: Hello, my name is John Doe and I am 30 years old.

# Using conditional statements to check if the person is of legal drinking age
if john_doe.age >= 21
  puts "Cheers!"
else
  puts "Sorry, you're not old enough to drink."
end

# Output: Cheers!

# Defining a module with a method
module Greeter
  # Method that takes in a name parameter and prints out a greeting
  def self.greet(name)
    puts "Hello, #{name}!"
  end
end

# Calling the greet method from the Greeter module
Greeter.greet("World")

# Output: Hello, World!
