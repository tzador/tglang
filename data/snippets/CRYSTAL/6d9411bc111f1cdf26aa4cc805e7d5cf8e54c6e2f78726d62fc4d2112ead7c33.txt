# Example of a recursive function in CRYSTAL

# Define a recursive function to calculate the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
# Param n: the index of the term to be calculated
# Returns: the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence

def fib(n)
  if n == 0 || n == 1
    return n
  else
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
  end
end

# Define variables to store the input and output
var input, output = 0

# Prompt the user for input and convert it to an integer
puts "Enter the index of the term to be calculated:"
input = gets.to_i

# Call the fib function and store the output in the output variable
output = fib(input)

# Print the output to the console
puts "The #{input}th term in the Fibonacci sequence is: #{output}"
