# This is a simple program in CRYSTAL that calculates the sum of two numbers and prints the result

# Define a method called 'sum' that takes in two parameters 'a' and 'b'
# The method returns the sum of the two parameters
def sum(a, b)
    return a + b
end

# Define two variables 'num1' and 'num2' and assign values to them
num1 = 10
num2 = 20

# Call the method 'sum' passing in 'num1' and 'num2' as arguments
result = sum(num1, num2)

# Print the result
puts "The sum of #{num1} and #{num2} is #{result}"

# Expected output: The sum of 10 and 20 is 30
