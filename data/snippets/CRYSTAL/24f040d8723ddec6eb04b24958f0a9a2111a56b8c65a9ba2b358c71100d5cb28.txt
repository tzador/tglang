# This is a complicated code snippet in CRYSTAL

# First, we define a class named "Person"
class Person
  # Class variables
  @@count = 0

  # Constructor method
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age

    # Increment count by 1 every time a new person is created
    @@count += 1
  end

  # Getter method for name
  def name
    return @name
  end

  # Getter method for age
  def age
    return @age
  end

  # Setter method for name
  def name=(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end

  # Setter method for age
  def age=(new_age)
    @age = new_age
  end

  # Class method to print the number of people created
  def self.count
    puts "There are #{@@count} people created."
  end
end

# Create an instance of Person and pass in arguments for name and age
person = Person.new("John", 25)

# Print the values for name and age using the getter methods
puts "Name: #{person.name}"
puts "Age: #{person.age}"

# Call the setter methods to change the name and age
person.name = "Jane"
person.age = 30

# Call the getter methods again to see the changes
puts "New name: #{person.name}"
puts "New age: #{person.age}"

# Call the class method to see the total number of people created
Person.count
