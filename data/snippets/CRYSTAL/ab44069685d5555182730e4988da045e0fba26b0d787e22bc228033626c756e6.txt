# This is a complex code snippet in CRYSTAL
# It takes in an array and prints out the sum of its elements
# Note: This code snippet is written in CRYSTAL version 1.1

# Define an array variable
array = [3, 5, 8, 2, 9]

# Define a function to calculate the sum of elements in an array
def sum(array)
  # Initialize a variable to store the sum
  sum = 0

  # Loop through the array and add each element to the sum
  for element in array
    sum += element
  end

  # Return the sum
  return sum
end

# Print the sum of the array elements using the previously defined function
puts sum(array)  # Output: 27

# This code snippet is just an example and can be modified and used in different applications.
