  # This is a CRYSTAL code snippet that creates a list of numbers and returns
  # their sum.

  # Create a method called "sum" that accepts one parameter called "list"
  def sum(list)
    # Create a variable to store the sum, initialize with 0
    total = 0
    # Loop through each element in the list
    list.each do |n|
      # Add the current number to the total
      total += n
    end
    # Return the total
    return total
  end

  # Create an array of numbers
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
  # Call the "sum" method with the numbers array as the argument
  result = sum(numbers)
  # Print the result
