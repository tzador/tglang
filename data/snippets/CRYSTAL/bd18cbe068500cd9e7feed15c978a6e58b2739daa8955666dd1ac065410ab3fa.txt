# *** Challenge: Generate a random number between 1 and 10
# *** Language: CRYSTAL

# Creates a function that takes in two parameters (min and max) and returns a random number between them.
def random_number(min, max)
  return min + rand() * (max - min)
end

# Assigns a variable called "result" to the function, passing in 1 as the minimum and 10 as the maximum.
result = random_number(1, 10)

# Prints out the result.
puts result

# OUTPUT:
# A random number between 1 and 10, such as 6.20512347981612.
