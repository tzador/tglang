# This is a function that takes in two numbers as arguments and returns the product of the two numbers
# and then prints the result to the screen
#
# Arguments:
# * num1: an integer
# * num2: an integer
#
# Returns: the product of num1 and num2, an integer

def multiply(num1 : Int, num2 : Int): Int
  result = num1 * num2     # multiply num1 and num2 and store the result in a variable
  puts "The product of #{num1} and #{num2} is #{result}"  # print the result to the screen
  return result           # return the result
end

# call the function and pass in two numbers as arguments
multiply(5, 10)   # output: The product of 5 and 10 is 50
