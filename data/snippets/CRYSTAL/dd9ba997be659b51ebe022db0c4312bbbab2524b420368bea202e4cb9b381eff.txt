#This is an example of a code snippet in CRYSTAL using a recursive function

#Create a class called Factorial with a method called "calculate" that takes in an integer argument
class Factorial
  def calculate(n)
    #Define a base case: if n is 0 or 1, return 1
    if n <= 1
      return 1
    end

    #Create a variable to store the result
    result = 1

    #Use a for loop to iterate through n
    for i in 1..n
      #Multiply the current number by the result variable
      result = result * i
    end

    #Return the result
    return result
  end
end

#Call the calculate method on the Factorial class with the argument 5 and store the result in a variable
result = Factorial.calculate(5)

#Print the result to the console
puts "The factorial of 5 is #{result}"

#Recursive version of the factorial function
def recursive_factorial(n)
  #Define a base case: if n is 0 or 1, return 1
  if n <= 1
    return 1
  else
    #Call the recursive_factorial function on n-1 and multiply it by n
    return n * recursive_factorial(n-1)
  end
end

#Call the recursive_factorial function with the argument 5 and store the result in a variable
recursive_result = recursive_factorial(5)

#Print the result to the console
puts "The factorial of 5 using recursion is #{recursive_result}"
