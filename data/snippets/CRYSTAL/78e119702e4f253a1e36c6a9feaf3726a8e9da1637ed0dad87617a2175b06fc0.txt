# This code snippet shows an example of complex calculations in CRYSTAL programming language

# Define variables
a = 10.5
b = 20
c = a + b

# Print the result
puts "The sum of #{a} and #{b} is #{c}."

# Create a function to calculate the factorial of a number
def factorial(x)
  result = 1
  while x > 1
    result *= x
    x -= 1
  end
  return result
end

# Use the function to calculate the factorial of a number
num = 5
factorial_result = factorial(num)

# Print the result
puts "The factorial of #{num} is #{factorial_result}."

# Create a new class called Animal
class Animal
  # Define properties
  property name : String
  property age : Int

  # Define constructor
  def initialize(@name, @age)
  end

  # Define methods
  def say_hello
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end

  def get_older
    @age += 1
    puts "I just had a birthday and now I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create new instance of Animal class
dog = Animal.new("Max", 3)

# Call methods on the instance
dog.say_hello # Output: Hello, my name is Max and I am 3 years old.
dog.get_older # Output: I just had a birthday and now I am 4 years old.
