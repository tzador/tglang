# This is a sample code snippet in Crystal programming language
# It contains a function that prints out the numbers 1 to 10
# with each number being multiplied by its own index value

# Define a function called printNumbers that takes in an integer as a parameter
def printNumbers(n : Int)
  # Declare a variable to store the result
  result = 0

  # Loop through the numbers 1 to 10
  for i in 1..10
    # Calculate the product of the current number (i) and its index (n)
    # and store it in the result variable
    result = i * n

    # Print out the result
    puts result
  end

  # Return the result variable
  return result
end

# Call the printNumbers function with the input 3
printNumbers(3)

# Output:
# 3
# 6
# 9
# 12
# 15
# 18
# 21
# 24
# 27
# 30
