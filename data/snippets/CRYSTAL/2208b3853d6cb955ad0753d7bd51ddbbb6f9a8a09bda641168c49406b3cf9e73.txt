# This is a function that takes in an array of integers and sorts it in ascending order
# The function uses the insertion sort algorithm
def insertion_sort(array : Array(Int32))
    # This loop iterates through each element in the array starting from the second element
    for i in 1...(array.length)
        # The current element is assigned to a variable
        current = array[i]
        # This loop compares the current element with the elements before it
        # and shifts them to the right if they are greater than the current element
        for j in (i-1).downto(0)
            # If the element is smaller than the current element, it is inserted at the correct position
            if array[j] > current
                array[j+1] = array[j]
                array[j] = current
            end
        end
    end

# Example usage of the function
numbers = [5, 2, 8, 4, 1]
insertion_sort(numbers)

# Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
