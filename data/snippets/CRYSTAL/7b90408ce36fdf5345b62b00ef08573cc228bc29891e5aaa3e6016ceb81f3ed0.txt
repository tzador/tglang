# This is a function that find the average value in a list of integers.
# It takes in a parameter that is a list of integers and returns the average as a float.
def find_average(list : Array(Int32)) : Float32
    # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of all the integers in the list.
    var sum = 0

    # Loop through the list and add each integer to the sum.
    for num in list do
        sum += num
    end

    # Return the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list.
    return sum / list.length.to_f
end

# Example of calling the function with a list of integers.
puts find_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # Output: 3.0
