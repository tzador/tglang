# This code snippet is written in CRYSTAL programming language
# It calculates the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to a given number

# Define a method named "calculate_sum" that takes in a `num` parameter
def calculate_sum(num)

    # Initialize a variable `sum` with a value of 0
    sum = 0

    # Use a `while` loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `num`
    while num > 0

        # Check if the current number is odd
        if num % 2 == 1
            # If it is, add it to the `sum` variable
            sum += num
        end

        # Decrease the value of `num` by 1 for the next iteration
        num -= 1
    end

    # Return the final value of `sum` as the output of the method
    sum
end

# Call the method and pass in a value of 15 as the argument
calculate_sum(15)

# Output: 64
