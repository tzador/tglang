# This is a Crystal code snippet
# It is a complex recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number

# Defines a factorial function that takes in an integer as the parameter
def factorial(num : Int32)

    # Base case - if the number is 0 or 1, then return 1
    if num <= 1
        return 1
        
    # Recursive case - if the number is greater than 1, call the factorial function again
    # with the number decremented by 1, and multiply it with the current number
    else
        return num * factorial(num - 1)
    end
end

# Gets user input for the number to calculate the factorial of
print "Enter a number: "
num = gets.chomp.to_i

# Prints the result by calling the factorial function with the user input as the parameter
puts "The factorial of #{num} is: #{factorial(num)}"

# Sample Output:
# Enter a number: 5
# The factorial of 5 is: 120
