# Define a class named Person
class Person

  # Declare attributes for the class
  @[FirstName: String]
  @[LastName: String]
  @[Age: Int]

  # Define a constructor for the class
  def initialize(@first_name, @last_name, @age)
    # Set the instance variables equal to the constructor's parameters
    @FirstName = @first_name
    @LastName = @last_name
    @Age = @age
  end

  # Define a method to get the person's full name
  def get_full_name
    # Concatenate the first name and last name with a space in between
    @FirstName + " " + @LastName
  end

end

# Create a new instance of the Person class
person = Person.new("John", "Smith", 25)

# Print out the person's full name using the get_full_name method
puts person.get_full_name

# Output: John Smith
