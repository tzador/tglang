# Create a class named Person
class Person

  # Define initialize method with two parameters, name and age
  def initialize(@name, @age : Int32)
    # Set instance variables for name and age
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  # Define a method that returns a greeting
  def greet
    # Interpolate name and age into greeting string
    "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create a new instance of Person and assign it to variable name john
john = Person.new("John", 25)

# Call greet method on john instance and print the returned string
puts john.greet
