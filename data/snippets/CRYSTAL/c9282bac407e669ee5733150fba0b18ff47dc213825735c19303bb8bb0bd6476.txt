# This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

# The function takes in one argument, the number whose factorial is to be calculated
# It returns the factorial of the input number
def factorial(n)

  # If the input number is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1
  if n <= 1
    return 1
  end

  # Declare a variable to store the factorial value
  fact = 1

  # Loop through numbers from 1 to the input number
  (1..n).each do |i|

    # Multiply the factorial variable with the current number
    fact *= i
  end

  # Return the factorial value
  return fact
end

# Call the factorial function with the number 5 and store the result in a variable
result = factorial(5)

# Print the result to the console
puts "The factorial of 5 is #{result}"
