# Define a class called "Animal"
class Animal
  # Create a macro to set attributes for instances of the class
  macro attr(*names)
    for name in names
      # Create getter method for each attribute
      def {{name.id}}
        @{{name.id}}

      def {{name.id}}=(value)

      end

  end

  # Use the macro to set attributes for instances of the "Animal" class
  attr name, age, species

  # Create a constructor method that takes in arguments for the attributes
  def initialize(@name, @age, @species)
  end

  # Define a method to print out the name of the animal
  def print_name
    puts "The animal's name is #{@name}"
  end
end

# Create an instance of the "Animal" class
new_animal = Animal.new("Penny", 5, "Dog")

# Call the "print_name" method on the instance
new_animal.print_name

# Output:
# The animal's name is Penny

# Change the age of the animal
new_animal.age = 6

# Call the "print_name" method again to verify the changes
new_animal.print_name

# Output:
# The animal's name is Penny
# The animal's age is now 6
