# This is a simple example of a function definition in CRYSTAL
# The function takes two arguments and
# returns a string based on the values passed in
# Note: this is purely for demonstration purposes and may not have any practical use

# This is the function definition, named 'example'
# The function takes two arguments, 'x' and 'y', both of type 'Int32'
def example(x : Int32, y : Int32)
# We declare a local variable 'result' of type 'String'
  result : String
# Check if x is greater than y
  if x > y
# If yes, set 'result' to a string stating that x is greater
    result = "#{x} is greater than #{y}"
# Check if y is greater than x
  elsif y > x
# If yes, set 'result' to a string stating that y is greater
    result = "#{y} is greater than #{x}"
# If neither x nor y is greater, set 'result' to a string stating they are equal
  else
    result = "#{x} and #{y} are equal"
  end
# Finally, return the value of 'result'
  return result
end

# Example function call with arguments 4 and 7
example(4, 7)

# Output: "7 is greater than 4"
