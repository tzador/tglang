# Output: This code snippet uses the CRYSTAL programming language to make a HTTP request to a specified URL and retrieve a response. It first requires the HTTP client library and then creates a new client object with the specified URL. Then, it uses the client object to make a GET request to the "/users" endpoint. The response is then stored in the "response" variable.
