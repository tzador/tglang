# This is a program that generates 100 random numbers and prints their sum

# Define a constant for the limit of the random numbers
LIMIT = 100

# Create an array to store the random numbers
numbers = Array(Int32).new(100)

# Use a loop to generate the random numbers and add them to the array
LIMIT.times do |i|
  numbers[i] = rand(1..100)
end

# Define a variable to store the sum of the numbers
sum = 0

# Use another loop to iterate through the array and add the numbers to the sum
numbers.each do |num|
  sum += num
end

# Print the sum
puts "The sum of 100 random numbers is: #{sum}"
