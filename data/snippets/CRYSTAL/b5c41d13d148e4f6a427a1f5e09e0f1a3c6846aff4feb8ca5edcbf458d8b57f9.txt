# This is a complex code snippet in the CRYSTAL programming language

# Defining a class named 'Person' with attributes 'name', 'age', and 'occupation'
class Person(name : String, age : Int32, occupation : String)
  # Setting the instance variables based on the attributes
  @name = name
  @age = age
  @occupation = occupation

  # Defining a method called 'greet' to greet the person
  def greet
    puts "Hello #{@name}! Nice to meet you."
  end

  # Defining a method called 'change_name' to change the person's name
  def change_name(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end

  # Defining a method called 'work' to display what occupation the person has
  def work
    puts "#{@name} is currently working as a #{@occupation}."
  end
end

# Creating an instance of the 'Person' class with name 'John', age 30, and occupation 'Software Engineer'
john = Person.new("John", 30, "Software Engineer")

# Calling the 'greet' method on the 'john' instance
john.greet

# Output: Hello John! Nice to meet you.

# Calling the 'change_name' method on the 'john' instance to change the name to 'Jonathan'
john.change_name("Jonathan")

# Calling the 'work' method on the 'john' instance to display his current occupation
john.work

# Output: Jonathan is currently working as a Software Engineer.
