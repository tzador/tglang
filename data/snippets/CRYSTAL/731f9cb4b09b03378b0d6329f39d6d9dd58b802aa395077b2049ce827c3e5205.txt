# This is a complex and long code snippet written in the CRYSTAL programming language

# Declare a class named `Person` with two properties - `name` and `age`
class Person
  property name : String
  property age : Int32

  # Instantiate a new Person object with name 'John' and age 25
  def initialize(@name = "John", @age = 25)
    puts "Creating new person with name #{@name} and age #{@age}"
  end

  # Define a method `greet` that takes in a language (String) and greets the person in that language
  def greet(language : String)
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
    case language
    when "english"
      puts "Nice to meet you!"
    when "spanish"
      puts "Â¡Mucho gusto!"
    else
      puts "Sorry, I don't speak that language."
    end
  end
end 

# Instantiate a new Person object with name 'Sarah' and age 32
p = Person.new("Sarah", 32) 

# Call the `greet` method on the `p` object, passing in the language 'english'
p.greet("english") 

# Output:
#
# Creating new person with name John and age 25
# Creating new person with name Sarah and age 32
# Hello, my name is Sarah and I am 32 years old.
# Nice to meet you!
