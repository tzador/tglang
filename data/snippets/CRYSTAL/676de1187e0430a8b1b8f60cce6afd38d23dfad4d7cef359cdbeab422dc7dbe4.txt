# This is a recursive function in Crystal that takes in an argument n
# and prints out the nth Fibonacci number.
# For example, calling fibonacci(5) would print out 5.
def fibonacci(n)
  # Base case: if n == 0 or n == 1, return n
  if n <= 1
    return n
  else
    # Recursive step: return the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
  end
end

# This is an example of calling the fibonacci function with input 5
fibonacci(5)
# Output should be 5, as the 5th Fibonacci number is 5.
