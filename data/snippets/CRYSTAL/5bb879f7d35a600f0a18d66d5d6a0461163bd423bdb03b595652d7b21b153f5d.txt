# An example of creating a class and implementing a method in CRYSTAL programming language

class Calculator

  # This method takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum
  def add(num1, num2)
    result = num1 + num2
    puts "The result is #{result}"
  end

  # This method calls the add method and passes in the numbers 5 and 10
  def run_calculation
    # You can also store the result of a method call in a variable
    total = add(5, 10)
    puts "The total is #{total}"
  end

end

# Instantiate an instance of the Calculator class
calc = Calculator.new

# Call the run_calculation method on the calculator instance
calc.run_calculation

# Output:
# The result is 15
# The total is 15
