# Create a class called Person
class Person

        puts "The age difference between #{@name} and #{other_person.@name} is #{age_difference} years."

end

# Create two instances of the Person class
person1 = Person.new("John", 25)
person2 = Person.new("Emily", 30)

# Introduce the two people
person1.introduce # Output: Hi, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
person2.introduce # Output: Hi, my name is Emily and I am 30 years old.

# Update the name of person1
person1.change_name("Jack") # Output: My name has been updated to Jack.

# Calculate the age difference between person1 and person2
person1.calculate_age_difference(person2) # Output: The age difference between Jack and Emily is 5 years.

# Get the name of person2 using the getter method
person2_name = person2.name # Output: Emily
puts "Person 2's name is #{person2_name}." # Output: Person 2's name is Emily.

# Update the age of person2 using the setter method
person2.age = 35
puts "Person 2 is now #{person2.age} years old." # Output: Person 2 is now 35 years old.
