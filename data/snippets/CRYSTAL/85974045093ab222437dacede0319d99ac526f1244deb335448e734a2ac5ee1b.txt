# This is a function that takes in two integers and returns their average
# Input: two integers, Output: the average of the two integers

# Defining the function
def average(x, y)
  sum = x + y # Calculating the sum of the two integers
  average = sum / 2.0 # Calculating the average by dividing the sum by 2.0
  return average # Returning the average
end

# Calling the function with inputs 5 and 10 and storing the output in a variable
result = average(5, 10)
puts "The average of 5 and 10 is: #{result}" # Printing the result to the console
