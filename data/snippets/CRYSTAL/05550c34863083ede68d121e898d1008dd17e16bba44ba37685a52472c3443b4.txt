# Define a class named Animal with two properties: name and age
class Animal
  property name : String
  property age : Int32

  # Create a constructor method that takes in the animal's name and age
  def initialize(@name : String, @age : Int32)
  end

  # Define a method that prints the animal's name and age to the console
  def printInfo
    puts "This animal is named #{@name} and is #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Animal class with a name and age
cat = Animal.new("Fluffy", 3)

# Calling the printInfo method on the animal instance
cat.printInfo()  # => This animal is named Fluffy and is 3 years old.
