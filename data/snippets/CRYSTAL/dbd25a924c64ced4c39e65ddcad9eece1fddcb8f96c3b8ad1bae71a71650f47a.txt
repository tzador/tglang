# This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of the squares of those numbers

# Define a function that takes in a list of Integers as an argument
def sum_of_squares(numbers : Array(Int32))
  # Initialize a variable to store the sum of squares
  sum = 0
  # Iterate through the list of numbers
  for number in numbers do
    # Square the current number and add it to the existing sum
    sum += number ** 2
  end
  # Return the calculated sum of squares
  sum
end

# Call the function with a list of numbers and store the result in a variable
result = sum_of_squares([2, 4, 6, 8])

# Print the result
puts "The sum of squares is: #{result}"  # Output: The sum of squares is: 120
