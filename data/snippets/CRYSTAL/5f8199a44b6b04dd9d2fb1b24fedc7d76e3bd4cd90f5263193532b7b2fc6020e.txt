# This code snippet is an example of a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
# This function uses recursion to calculate the factorial

# function to calculate factorial
def factorial(n : Int32) : Int32
  # base case, if n is 0, return 1
  if n == 0
    return 1
  end

  # recursive case, calculate factorial using recursion
  return n * factorial(n - 1)
end

# output the factorial of 6
puts factorial(6)

# output the factorial of 10
puts factorial(10)
