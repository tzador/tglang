# This is a complex code snippet in CRYSTAL

# Define a class called "Person"
class Person
  # Define getter and setter methods for the "name" attribute
  getter :name
  setter :name

  # Define a default constructor
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name

  # Define a method that will greet the person

  # Define a class variable that will keep track of total number of people created
  @@total_people = 0

  # Define a class method to print out the total number of people
  def self.print_total
    puts "Total number of people created: #{@@total_people}"
  end

  # Define a class method to increase the total number of people
  def self.increment_total
    @@total_people += 1
  end
end

# Create a new instance of Person called "John"
john = Person.new("John")

# Call the greet method on the "John" instance
john.greet() #=> Hello, John!

# Call the setter method to change the "John" instance's name to "Jane"
john.name = "Jane"

# Call the greet method again to see the updated name
john.greet() #=> Hello, Jane!

# Call the class method to see the total number of people created so far
Person.print_total() #=> Total number of people created: 1

# Create another instance of Person called "Bob"
bob = Person.new("Bob")

# Call the class method to see the updated total number of people
Person.print_total() #=> Total number of people created: 2
