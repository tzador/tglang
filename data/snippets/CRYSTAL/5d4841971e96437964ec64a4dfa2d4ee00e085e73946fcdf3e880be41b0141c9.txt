# This is an example of a complex CRYSTAL code snippet
# This snippet creates a class and defines a method with arguments and a block
class User
  attr_accessor :name, :email

  # Initializes the User class with a name and email
  def initialize(name : String, email : String)
    @name = name
    @email = email
  end

  # Prints the user's name and email
  def print_user
    puts "Name: #{@name}"
    puts "Email: #{email}"
  end

  # This method takes in an integer as an argument and outputs the factorial of that number
  def calculate_factorial(number : Int32)
    factorial = 1
  
    # Uses a block to loop through and calculate the factorial
    1.upto(number) do |i|
      factorial *= i
    end
  
    # Outputs the factorial 
    puts "The factorial of #{number} is #{factorial}"
  end
end

# Creates a new user object with name and email
user = User.new("John", "john@example.com")

# Calls the print_user method to print the user's information
user.print_user

# Calls the calculate_factorial method with an argument of 5
user.calculate_factorial(5)
