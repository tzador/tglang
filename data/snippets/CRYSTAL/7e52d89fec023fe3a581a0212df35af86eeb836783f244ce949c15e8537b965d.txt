# First, we define a constant called PI
PI = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058

# Next, we create a function to calculate the area of a circle
def calculate_area(radius)
  area = PI * radius * radius # This is an example of mathematical operation in CRYSTAL
  return area
end

# Now we call the function with a radius of 5 and print the result
print "The area of a circle with radius 5 is ", calculate_area(5)
