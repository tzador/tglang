# This is a code snippet in Crystal
# It implements a simple hello world program with a factorial function

# Define a function to find factorial of a given number
def factorial(n)
  if n <= 1
    return 1
  end

  return n * factorial(n - 1)
end

# Get user input for the number to find factorial of
puts "Enter a number to find its factorial:"
input = gets.to_i

# Call the factorial function and print the result
puts "Factorial of #{input} is #{factorial(input)}"
