# Define a constant variable `PI` with a value of 3.14159
CONST PI = 3.14159

# Define an array of strings with the names of 5 planets
PLANETS = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter"]

# Define a function that calculates the area of a circle from a given radius
def calculate_area(radius)
  return PI * (radius * radius)
end

# Create a variable `radius` and assign it a value of 10
radius = 10

# Call the `calculate_area` function with `radius` as the argument and store the result in `area`
area = calculate_area(radius)

# Print out the calculated area, formatted to 2 decimal places
puts "The area of a circle with a radius of #{radius} units is #{area.round(2)} units squared."

# Output:
# The area of a circle with a radius of 10 units is 314.16 units squared.
