# This is a complex function in CRYSTAL that calculates the nth Fibonacci number

# Annotated function definition with parameter type
def fib(n : Int32)
  # Declare two variables to store the first and second Fibonacci numbers
  first = 0
  second = 1
  # Loop through n times to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion
  n.times do
    # Assign the sum of first and second Fibonacci numbers to a new variable
    result = first + second
    # Reassign the first and second variables to the previous and current Fibonacci numbers respectively
    first = second
    second = result
  end
  # Return the nth Fibonacci number
  return result
end

# Print the result of calling the fib function with the input of 10
puts fib(10)
 
# Output:
# 55
