# This is a complex code snippet written in the CRYSTAL programming language
puts "Hello, world!" # This line outputs the classic phrase "Hello, world!" to the console

# Define a class called "Person" with name and age attributes
class Person
  attr_accessor name : String
  attr_accessor age : Int32

  # Define an initialize method to set values for name and age when creating new instances
  def initialize(@name : String, @age : Int32)
  end

  # Define a method called "introduce" to print out a personalized introduction
  def introduce
    puts "Hi, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."

end

# Create a new instance of the Person class and assign values to name and age attributes
person1 = Person.new("John", 30)

# Call the "introduce" method on person1 to print out the introduction
person1.introduce # This line should output "Hi, my name is John and I am 30 years old." to the console
