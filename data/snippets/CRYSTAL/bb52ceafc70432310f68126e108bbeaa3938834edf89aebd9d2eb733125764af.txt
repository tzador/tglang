# This is a complex code snippet in CRYSTAL programming language

# Create a class Person
class Person
  # Initialize instance variables name and age
  def initialize(@name = "John Doe", @age = 25)
  end

  # Define getter method for name
  def name
    @name
  end

  # Define setter method for age
  def age=(new_age)
    @age = new_age
  end

  # Define a method to print out the person's information
  def info
    puts "Name: #{@name}, Age: #{@age}"
  end

  # Use the with statement to modify name and age within a block
  # Notice the syntax with do..end, no need for curly braces
  def modify_info
    with do
      @name = "Jane Doe"
      @age = 30
    end
  end

  # Define a method to check if a person is an adult (age >= 18)
  def adult?
    @age >= 18 ? true : false
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Person class
p = Person.new

# Output the information using the info method
p.info # => Name: John Doe, Age: 25

# Use the setter method to change the person's age to 35
p.age = 35

# Output the updated information using the info method
p.info # => Name: John Doe, Age: 35

# Use the modify_info method to change the person's name and age
p.modify_info

# Output the updated information using the info method
p.info # => Name: Jane Doe, Age: 30

# Check if the person is an adult using the adult? method
p.adult? # => true
