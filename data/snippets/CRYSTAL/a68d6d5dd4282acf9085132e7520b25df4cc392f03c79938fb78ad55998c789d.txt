# This is a CRYSTAL program to calculate the area of a rectangle

# Define a class named Rectangle
class Rectangle
    # Define two instance variables for length and width
    @length : Int32
    @width : Int32

    # Define a constructor method that takes in length and width as parameters
    def initialize(@length : Int32, @width : Int32)
    end

    # Define a method to calculate the area of the rectangle
    def calculate_area
        # Multiply the length and width to get the area
        area = @length * @width

        # Print out the result to the console
        puts "The area of the rectangle is #{area}"
    end
end

# Create an instance of the Rectangle class with length of 5 and width of 10
rectangle = Rectangle.new(5, 10)

# Call the calculate_area method on the instance
rectangle.calculate_area

# Output: The area of the rectangle is 50
