# This is a code snippet in CRYSTAL, a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.
# It is a complex snippet that includes loops, conditionals, data structures, and function calls.

# Define a constant variable
const PI = 3.141592653589793

# Define a global variable
$global_var = "Hello World!"

# Define a class
class Shape
  # Define instance variables
  @name : String
  @color : String
  @area : Float32

  # Define constructor
  def initialize(@name, @color)
    puts "Creating a new Shape object."
  end

  # Define a method
  def calculate_area(side_length)
    if @name == "Square"
      @area = side_length * side_length
    elsif @name == "Circle"
      @area = PI * side_length * side_length
    end
  end
end

# Create instances of the Shape class
square = Shape.new("Square", "red")
circle = Shape.new("Circle", "blue")

# Define a hash data structure
shapes = {
  "square" => square,
  "circle" => circle
}

# Use a loop to iterate through the shapes hash
shapes.each do |key, value|
  puts "The #{key} has a #{value.calculate_area(5)} area."
end

# Call a function
def print_message(msg)
  puts "Message: #{msg}"
end

# Use a conditional statement
if square.calculate_area(5) > circle.calculate_area(5)
  print_message("The square has a larger area than the circle.")
else
  print_message("The circle has a larger area than the square.")
end
