# The generic type T should be a subtype of Number
def distance_between_points(T: Number)(point1 : Point, point2 : Point) : T
  x_diff = (point1.x - point2.x) ** 2 # `**` is the exponent operator in Crystal
  y_diff = (point1.y - point2.y) ** 2

# This is an example of calling the distance_between_points function and printing the result
