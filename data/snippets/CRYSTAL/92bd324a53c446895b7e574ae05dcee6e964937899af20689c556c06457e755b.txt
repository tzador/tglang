# This is a complex function that takes in an array of integers and returns their sum
# Takes in an argument of type Array(Int32)
# Returns an integer

def sum_of_array(array : Array(Int32)) : Int32
  # Set a variable to store the sum
  sum : Int32 = 0

  # Use a for loop to iterate through the array
  for element in array do
    # Add each element to the sum variable
    sum += element
  end

  # Return the sum

# This is a method that calculates the factorial of a given number
# Takes in an argument of type Int32
# Returns an integer

  # Use a while loop to calculate the factorial

# Example usage of the functions
# Create an array of integers
array_of_ints = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Call the sum_of_array function and store the result in a variable
sum = sum_of_array(array_of_ints)

# Print the result to the console
puts "The sum of the array is #{sum}"

# Calculate the factorial of a number and print the result
