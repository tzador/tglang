# This is a code snippet in the CRYSTAL programming language.
# It is a complex recursive function that finds the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.

# Define the function with one integer parameter n.
# Use tail recursion to improve performance.
def fibonacci(n : Int64) : Int64
  # If n is 0 or 1, return n as these are the base cases.
  if n <= 1
    return n
  else
    # Use recursion to calculate the nth term by adding the previous two terms.
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
  end
end

# Call the function and print the result
# This will output the 10th term of the Fibonacci sequence, which is 55.
puts fibonacci(10)
