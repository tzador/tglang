# Example Crystal code snippet
# Square root function

# Define a method to calculate the square root of a number
def square_root(x)
  if x < 0
    raise Exception.new("x cannot be negative")
  end

  # Initialize a variable for the guess, starting at half of x
  guess = x / 2.0

  # Use a loop to iterate until the guess is close enough
  while (guess * guess - x).abs > 0.001
    # Use the Newton-Raphson method to update the guess
    guess = (guess + x / guess)/2.0
  end

  # Return the final guess as the square root of x
  return guess
end

# Call the method and print the result
puts "Square root of 9: #{square_root(9)}"

# Output:
# Square root of 9: 3.00009155413138
