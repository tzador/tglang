# Define a class called Calculator with three instance variables
class Calculator
  @value1 : Int32

  @operator : Char

  # Create a constructor method that takes in two arguments and assigns them to the instance variables
  def initialize(x, y)
    @value1 = x
    @value2 = y
  end

  # Define a method that performs addition and returns the result
  def add
    @value1 + @value2
  end

  # Define a method that performs subtraction and returns the result
  def subtract
    @value1 - @value2
  end

  # Define a method that performs multiplication and returns the result
  def multiply
    @value1 * @value2
  end

  # Define a method that performs division and returns the result
  def divide
    @value1 / @value2
  end

  # Define a method that performs exponentiation and returns the result
  def exponent
    @value1 ** @value2
  end

  # Define a method that performs modulus and returns the result
  def modulus
    @value1 % @value2
  end

  # Define a method that checks the equality of two instances of Calculator
  def equals(another_calculator)
    @value1 == another_calculator.value1 && @value2 == another_calculator.value2 && @operator == another_calculator.operator
  end

  # Define a method that returns the instance variables as a string
  def to_s
    "#{@value1} #{@operator} #{@value2}"
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Calculator class with two values and addition as the operator
calc = Calculator.new(10, 5)

# Call the add method on the instance and print the result
puts calc.add  # Output: 15

# Print the instance variables using the to_s method
puts calc.to_s  # Output: "10 + 5"
