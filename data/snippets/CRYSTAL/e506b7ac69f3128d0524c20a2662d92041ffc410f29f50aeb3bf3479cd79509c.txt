# This code snippet uses the for loop to iterate through a range of numbers from 1 to 10.
# With the use of the if/else statement, the code checks whether the current number is even or odd.
# Depending on the result, the code prints a message along with the current number.
# The .to_s method is used to convert the integer value to a string for concatenation with the print statement.
