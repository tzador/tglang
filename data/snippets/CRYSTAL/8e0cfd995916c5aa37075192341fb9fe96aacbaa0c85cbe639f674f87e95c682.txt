# A function that calculates the factorial of a given number
# and returns the result

# Define the factorial function
func factorial(num)
    # Initialize the result variable to 1
    # This will be used to store the product of each number
    result := 1

    # Create a loop that iterates from num to 1
    # The loop will run num times, each time multiplying the result by i
    for i in 1..num
        result *= i
    end

    # Return the result
    return result
end

# Call the factorial function with a number as the argument
# The result will be stored in the factorial_result variable
factorial_result := factorial(5)

# Print the result to the console
puts factorial_result
