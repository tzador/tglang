# This is a Crystal program that converts a number to its binary representation

# Define a method that takes in an integer as an argument
def convert_to_binary(number : Int32)

  # Initialize an empty array to store the binary digits
  binary_digits = []

  # Loop while the number is greater than 0
  while number > 0

    # Add the remainder of number divided by 2 to the binary digits array
    binary_digits << number % 2

    # Update the number by dividing it by 2
    number /= 2
  end

  # Reverse the array to get the correct binary representation
  binary_digits.reverse!

  # Print out the binary representation
  puts "The binary representation of #{number} is: #{binary_digits.join}"
end

# Call the method and pass in the number to convert
