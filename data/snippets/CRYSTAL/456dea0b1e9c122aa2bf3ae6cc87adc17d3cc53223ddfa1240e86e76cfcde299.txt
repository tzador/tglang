# This is a function called "factorial" that takes in an integer "n" as a parameter

def factorial(n)
  # Create a variable "result" to store the result of the factorial
  result = 1

  # Create a loop that starts at 1 and iterates up to n
  # Note: in Crystal, the "for" keyword is used for looping
  for i in 1..n
    # Update the "result" variable by multiplying it with the current value of "i"
    result = result * i
  end

  # Return the final value of "result"
  result
end

# Create a variable "input" and assign it the value of 5
input = 5

# Call the "factorial" function and pass in the value of "input" as the argument
# Note: the "puts" keyword is used to print to the console in Crystal
puts factorial(input)

# Expected output: 120
