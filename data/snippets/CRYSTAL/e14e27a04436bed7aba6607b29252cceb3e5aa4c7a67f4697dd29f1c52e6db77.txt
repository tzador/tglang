# This is a sample code snippet in CRYSTAL

# Declare a class named Student with attributes
# name, age, and grades
class Student
  # Initialize the attributes
  def initialize(name, age, grades)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @grades = grades
  end

  # Define a method to calculate the average grade
  def calc_avg_grade
    # First, calculate the total sum
    sum = 0.0
    for grade in @grades
      sum += grade
    end
    # Divide the total sum by the number of grades
    avg = sum / @grades.length
    # Print the average grade
    puts "The average grade is #{avg}"
  end
end

# Create instances of the Student class
student1 = Student.new("John", 18, [85, 90, 95])
student2 = Student.new("Jane", 17, [95, 98, 92])

# Call the calc_avg_grade method on each student instance
student1.calc_avg_grade
student2.calc_avg_grade
