# This is a complex code snippet written in the CRYSTAL programming language.
# It demonstrates the use of multiple variables, conditional statements, and loops.
#

# Define a list of names
names = ["John", "Jane", "Mary", "David"]

# Define a list of ages
ages = [27, 34, 21, 19]

# Define a function to check if a person is eligible to vote
def is_eligible?(age)
  if age >= 18
    true
  else
    false
  end
end

# Use a loop to iterate through the list of names
for name in names
  puts "Name: #{name}"

  # Find the corresponding age using the index
  age = ages[names.index(name)]
  puts "Age: #{age}"

  # Check if the person is eligible to vote
  if is_eligible?(age)
    puts "This person can vote"
  else
    puts "This person is not eligible to vote"
  end
end

# Define a variable for the current year
current_year = 2021

# Use a conditional statement to determine if someone will turn 18 this year
for age in ages
  if age + 18 == current_year
    puts "Someone will turn 18 this year"
  end
end

# Output the length of the names list
puts "Number of names: #{names.length}"
