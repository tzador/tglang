# This is a complex code snippet in CRYSTAL programming language.
# It creates an array of 10 elements, performs calculations, and outputs the result.

# Define a constant named PI and set its value to 3.14159
PI = 3.14159

# Create an array of 10 randomly generated numbers
numbers = Array.new(10){Random.rand()}

# Define a method that calculates the area of a circle with a given radius
def calculate_area(radius)
  # Use the previously defined constant PI to calculate the area
  area = PI * radius * radius
  # Return the area as a float
  return Float32(area)
end

# Loop through the array of numbers and calculate the area of a circle with each number as the radius
numbers.each do |number|
  # Call the calculate_area method and pass in the current number as the radius
  area = calculate_area(number)
  # Output the calculated area with a string telling the user the radius used
  puts "The area of a circle with a radius of #{number} is #{area}."
end

# Define a method that finds the average of an array of numbers
def calculate_average(numbers)
  # Initialize a variable to store the sum of the numbers
  sum = 0
  # Loop through the numbers
  numbers.each do |number|
    # Add each number to the sum variable
    sum += number
  end
  # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total number of elements in the array
  average = sum / numbers.size
  # Return the average as an integer
  return Int32(average)
end

# Call the calculate_average method on the array of numbers and output the result
puts "The average of the array of numbers is #{calculate_average(numbers)}."
