# This code snippet is a Bubble Sort algorithm implementation in Crystal Programming Language

# Create an unsorted array
array = [5, 2, 7, 1, 3, 6, 4]

# Define a method for Bubble Sort algorithm
def bubble_sort(array)
  # Set a flag to keep track of whether a swap has been made
  swapped = false

  # Use a loop to traverse the array
  until swapped
    # Initialize the swapped flag to be false at the beginning of each loop
    swapped = false

    # Use another loop to compare each element with its adjacent element
    for i in 0...(array.size - 1)
      # If the current element is greater than the next element, swap their positions
      if array[i] > array[i + 1]
        # Use parallel assignment to swap elements
        array[i], array[i + 1] = array[i + 1], array[i]
        # Set the swapped flag to be true to indicate a swap has occurred
        swapped = true
      end
    end
  end
  # Return the sorted array
  return array
end

# Call the method passing in the unsorted array as an argument
sorted_array = bubble_sort(array)

# Print the sorted array
puts "Sorted array: #{sorted_array}"
