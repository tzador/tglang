# This is a simple CRYSTAL code snippet
# It contains a class with a constructor, methods, and instance variables

# Creating a class called "Person"
class Person
  # Declaring instance variables
  Name : String
  Age : Int32
  Phone_Num : String
  Address : String

  # Defining a constructor that takes in values for the instance variables
  def initialize(name, age, phone_num, address)
    @Name = name
    @Age = age
    @Phone_Num = phone_num
    @Address = address
  end

  # Defining a method to print out the person's information
  def print_info
    puts "Name: #{@Name}"
    puts "Age: #{@Age}"
    puts "Phone Number: #{@Phone_Num}"
    puts "Address: #{@Address}"
  end

  # Defining a method to update the person's address
  def update_address(new_address)
    @Address = new_address
    puts "#{@Name}'s address has been updated to: #{@Address}"
  end

  # Defining a method to calculate the person's birth year
  def calculate_birth_year
    current_year = Time.now.year
    birth_year = current_year - @Age
    puts "#{@Name} was born in #{birth_year}."
  end
end

# Creating an instance of the Person class and passing in values for the instance variables
person1 = Person.new("John", 30, "555-123-4567", "123 Main St.")

# Calling the print_info method on the person1 object to print out their information
person1.print_info()

# Updating the address for person1
person1.update_address("456 Maple Ave.")

# Calculating the birth year for person1
person1.calculate_birth_year()
