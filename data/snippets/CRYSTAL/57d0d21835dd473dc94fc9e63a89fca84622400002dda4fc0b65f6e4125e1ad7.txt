# This is a sample code snippet in Crystal
# It includes control flow, variables, and functions
# Variables
var a : Int32 = 5
var b : Int32 = 10

# Functions
# This function takes in two integers and returns their sum
def add(x : Int32, y : Int32) : Int32
  return x + y
end

# Control Flow
# This if statement checks if a is greater than b and prints the result
if a > b
  puts "a is greater than b"
else
  puts "a is less than b"
end

# This while loop will print all numbers from 1 to 10
i = 1
while i <= 10
  puts i
  i += 1
end

# This for loop iterates through an array and prints each element
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in array
  puts number
end

# This case statement checks the value of a and returns a message based on the value
case a
when 1
  puts "a is equal to 1"
when 2
  puts "a is equal to 2"
else
  puts "a is neither 1 nor 2"
end

# Output:
# a is less than b
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# a is neither 1 nor 2
