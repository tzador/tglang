# A simple function that takes in a string and outputs
# the reversed version of that string.

# Define a function called "reverse_string" that takes
# in a string "str" as a parameter.
def reverse_string(str : String)
    # Declare an array to store the reversed characters.
    reversed_chars = Array(String).new

    # Loop through the characters in the string in reverse.
    # Start the index "i" at the last character.
    for i in (str.size - 1).downto(0)
        # Add the character at index "i" to the array.
        reversed_chars << str[i]
    end

    # Convert the array of characters into a string and
    # return it.
    reversed = reversed_chars.join

    # Return the reversed string.
    return reversed
end

# Call the function and output the result.
puts reverse_string("Hello World") #=> "dlroW olleH"
