{% comment %} This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term %}

# Define the nth term to calculate
nth_term = 10

# Define an array to store the Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci_sequence = [0, 1]

# Loop through each term and calculate the next term using the previous two terms
for i in 2..nth_term-1
  fibonacci_sequence[i] = fibonacci_sequence[i-2] + fibonacci_sequence[i-1]
end

# Print the calculated Fibonacci sequence
puts "The Fibonacci sequence up to the #{nth_term}th term is #{fibonacci_sequence}"
