# This code snippet creates a custom struct called Person and prints out their information based on their name and age 

# Define the Person struct with name and age fields
struct Person 
    name : String
    age : Int32

# Create an instance of Person struct
person = Person.new

# Prompt user for their name and age
puts "Enter your name:"
person.name = gets.chomp
puts "Enter your age:"
person.age = gets.chomp.to_i
