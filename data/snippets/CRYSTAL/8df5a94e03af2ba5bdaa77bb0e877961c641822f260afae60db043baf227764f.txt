# This is a complex code snippet in Crystal programming language

# Define a class named "Person"
class Person
  # Define instance variables for the Person class
  @name : String
  @age : Int32
  @location : String
  @occupation : String

  # Define a constructor for the Person class that takes in all instance variables as arguments
  def initialize(name : String, age : Int32, location : String, occupation : String)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @location = location
    @occupation = occupation
  end

  # Define a method for the Person class that prints out information about the person
  def info
    puts "Name: #{@name}"
    puts "Age: #{@age}"
    puts "Location: #{@location}"
    puts "Occupation: #{@occupation}"
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Person class with specific values for each instance variable
person = Person.new("John", 30, "New York", "Software Engineer")

# Call the info method on the person instance to print out their information
person.info

# Output:
# Name: John
# Age: 30
# Location: New York
# Occupation: Software Engineer
