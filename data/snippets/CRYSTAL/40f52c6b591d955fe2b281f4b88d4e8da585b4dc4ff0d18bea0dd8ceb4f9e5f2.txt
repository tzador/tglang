# We define a class called `Animal`
class Animal
  # `property` macro automatically creates getter and setter methods for `name` and `age` variables
  # We provide a default value for `age` as 0
  property name, age = 0

  # `macro` defines a new macro, which can be used to DRY up code
  # In this case, we define a `speak` macro that will print the name and age of the animal
  macro speak
    puts "Hi, my name is #{name} and I am #{age} years old."
  end

  # `initialize` is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated
  # In this case, we set the value of `name` and `age` when the object is created
  def initialize(@name, @age)
  end
end

# We create a new instance of `Animal` called `dog` with the name "Fido" and age 5
dog = Animal.new("Fido", 5)

# We can access the `name` and `age` variables using the getter methods created by the `property` macro
puts "My name is #{dog.name} and I am #{dog.age} years old."
# Output: My name is Fido and I am 5 years old.

# We can also use the `speak` macro to print out the information about the animal
dog.speak
# Output: Hi, my name is Fido and I am 5 years old.
