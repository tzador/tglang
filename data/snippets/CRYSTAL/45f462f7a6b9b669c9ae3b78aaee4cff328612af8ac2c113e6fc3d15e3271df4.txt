# Example program in Crystal
# This program prints the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
# Define a method called fibonacci with one parameter: n
def fibonacci(n)
# Create an array to store the values of the sequence
  fib_nums = [0, 1]
# Use a loop to generate the sequence
  (n - 2).times do
# Initialize a variable to store the value of the next number in the sequence
    next_num = fib_nums[-1] + fib_nums[-2]
# Append the next number to the array
    fib_nums << next_num
  end
# Print the first 20 numbers in the sequence
  puts fib_nums[0..19]
end

# Call the fibonacci method with an input of 20
fibonacci(20)

# Output:
# [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181]
