# This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the largest number in the list.
def find_largest(list : Array(Int32)) : Int32
  # We initialize the largest number to be the first element in the list.
  largest = list[0]
  # We iterate through the list to find the largest number.
  list.each do |num|
    # If the current number is larger than our current largest number, we set it as the new largest number.
    if num > largest
      largest = num
    end
  end
  # Finally, we return the largest number.
  return largest

# Example usage: We create a list of numbers and pass it into the function to find the largest number.
nums = [4, 9, 2, 6, 8]
puts "The largest number in the list is: #{find_largest(nums)}"  # Output: The largest number in the list is: 9
