# This is a simple program in Crystal to print Fibonacci series

# Defining two variables to hold the first two numbers of the series
# Note: Crystal assigns types automatically based on assigned values
a = 0
b = 1

# Defining a third variable to hold the sum of previous two numbers
c = 0

# Taking user input for the number of terms in the series
# Note: gets method accepts input as a string, `to_i` converts it to integer
print "Enter the number of terms in the series: "
n = gets.to_i

# Starting a loop to generate the series
while c < n do

    # Printing the current term in the series
    puts a

    # Updating the values of variables for the next term in the series
    c += 1
    temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp + b
end

# Output:
# Enter the number of terms in the series: 10
# 0
# 1
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 5
# 8
# 13
# 21
# 34
