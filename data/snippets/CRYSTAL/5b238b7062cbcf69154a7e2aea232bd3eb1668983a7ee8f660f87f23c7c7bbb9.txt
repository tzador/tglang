# This is a code snippet in CRYSTAL that uses recursion to count down from a given number

# Define a method called count_down that takes in a number as a parameter
def count_down(number)
    # Base case - if the number is 0, print "Countdown complete" and return
    if number == 0
        print "Countdown complete"
        return
    # Else, print the current number and recursively call count_down with the next number
    else
        print "Current number: #{number}"
        count_down(number - 1) 
    end
end

# Call the method with a starting number of 10
count_down(10)

# Output:
# Current number: 10
# Current number: 9
# Current number: 8
# Current number: 7
# Current number: 6
# Current number: 5
# Current number: 4
# Current number: 3
# Current number: 2
# Current number: 1
# Countdown complete
