# This is a sample function that takes in an array of numbers and
# a multiplier factor, and returns a new array with each element
# multiplied by the factor.

fun multiply(arr : Array(Int32), factor : Int32) : Array(Int32)
  # creates a new array with the same length as the input array
  newArr = Array(Int32).new(arr.size)

  # iterates through the input array and multiplies each element by the factor
  for i in 0..arr.size-1
    newArr[i] = arr[i] * factor
  end
  # returns the new array
  newArr
end

# example function call
result = multiply([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
puts result # prints [2, 4, 6, 8]
