# This is a sample code snippet in CRYSTAL
# Here, we are declares a class named "Example"
class Example
  # This is a method to calculate the sum of two numbers
  # The method takes in two arguments, a and b
  def self.sum(a, b)
    a + b
  end

  # This is a method to calculate the factorial of a number
  # The method takes in one argument, n
  # The factorial is calculated recursively
  def self.factorial(n)
    if n < 1
      1
    else
      n * factorial(n - 1)
    end
  end
end

# Here, we are calling the sum method with arguments 5 and 10
puts Example.sum(5, 10) #=> 15

# Here, we are calling the factorial method with argument 5
puts Example.factorial(5) #=> 120
