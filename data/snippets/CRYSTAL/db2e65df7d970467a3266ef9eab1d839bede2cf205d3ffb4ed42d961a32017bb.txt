# This is a method that takes in two strings and returns a new string
# that combines the two input strings with a space in between them.
# It first checks if either of the strings is empty and returns the other string if so.
# Otherwise, it creates a new string and iterates through each character of the two input strings,
# adding them to the new string with a space in between.
# Finally, it returns the new string.
