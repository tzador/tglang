# This code snippet uses a recursive function to generate the next number
# in the Fibonacci sequence

# Define a function that takes in the current number and the previous number
# and returns the next number in the sequence
def fib(current : Int32, previous : Int32)
  # Base case: if current number is less than or equal to 1,
  # return 1 (first two numbers in Fibonacci sequence)
  if current <= 1
    return 1
  else
    # Recursive case: return the sum of the current and previous numbers
    # by calling the function on the previous two numbers in the sequence
    return fib(current - 1, previous) + fib(current - 2, previous)
  end
end

# Create variables to initialize the sequence with the first two numbers
first = 1
second = 1

# Use a loop to print out the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
for i in 1..20 do
  # Use the function to generate the next number in the sequence
  next_number = fib(i, first)

  # Set the current number as the previous number for the next iteration
  first = next_number

  # Print out the current number
  puts next_number
end
