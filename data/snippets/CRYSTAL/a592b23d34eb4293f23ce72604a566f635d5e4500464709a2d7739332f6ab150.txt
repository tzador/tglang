# Function to calculate the factorial of a number
def factorial(n)
  # Initalize result variable
  result = 1

  # Loop from 1 to n
  for i in 1..n do
    # Multiply result with current value of i
    # and assign it back to result
    result = result * i
  end

  # Return result
  result
end

# Print the factorial of 5
puts factorial(5)

# Output:
