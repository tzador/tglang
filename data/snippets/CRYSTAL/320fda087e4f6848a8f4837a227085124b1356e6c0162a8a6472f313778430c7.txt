# This is a complex code snippet in CRYSTAL

# First we define a class with some methods and attributes
class Person
  # We have two attributes, name and age
  property name : String
  property age : Int32

  # This is a method that prints a greeting with the person's name
  def greet
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name}."
  end

  # This is a method that calculates the person's birth year
  def calculate_birth_year
    current_year = Time.now.year
    birth_year = current_year - @age
    return birth_year
  end
end

# Now we create an instance of the Person class and assign values to its attributes
person = Person.new
person.name = "John"
person.age = 25

# The instance can now call its methods
person.greet
# Output: Hello, my name is John.

birth_year = person.calculate_birth_year
puts "I was born in #{birth_year}."
# Output: I was born in 1996.
