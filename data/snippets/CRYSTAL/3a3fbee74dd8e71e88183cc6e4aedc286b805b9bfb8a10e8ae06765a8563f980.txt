# This code snippet uses the 'get' macro to define a route for "/users".
# It then defines a method named get_users which queries all users from the database and returns them as a JSON response with a status code of 200.
# The '@' symbol declares that this is a class-level annotation.
# The 'def' keyword is used to define a method followed by its name.
# Inside the method, we use the 'User.all' method to query all users from the database and assign them to the 'users' variable.
# Then, we call the 'json_response' method to return the users as a JSON response with a status code of 200.
