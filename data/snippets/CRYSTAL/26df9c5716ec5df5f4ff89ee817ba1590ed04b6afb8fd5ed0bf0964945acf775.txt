# This is a code snippet in Crystal
# It uses structs and methods to manipulate data

# Define a struct for a Person
struct Person
  name : String
  age : Int32
  occupation : String
end

# Create a method to add a new person to a list of people
def add_person(people : Array(Person), name : String, age : Int32, occupation : String)
  person = Person.new(name, age, occupation)
  people << person
end

# Create a method to get the average age of all the people in the list
def get_average_age(people : Array(Person)) : Int32
  sum = 0
  for person in people
    sum += person.age
  end
  average = sum / people.size
  return average
end

# Create a list of people and add some sample data
people = Array(Person).new
add_person(people, "John", 27, "Software Engineer")
add_person(people, "Emily", 32, "Teacher")
add_person(people, "David", 41, "Lawyer")

# Print out the list of people and their information
puts "List of People:"
for person in people
  puts "Name: #{person.name}"
  puts "Age: #{person.age}"
  puts "Occupation: #{person.occupation}"
end

# Get the average age of the people in the list and print it out
average_age = get_average_age(people)
