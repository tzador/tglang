# Fib function that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number
# Takes in an integer n and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number
def fib(n : Int32) : Int32

# Define variables for storing the first two Fibonacci numbers
var first = 0
var second = 1

# Loop through each number and calculate the Fibonacci number
for i in 0..n-1
  # Add the previous two numbers to get the current Fibonacci number
  var current = first + second
  # Update the first and second variables
  first = second
  second = current
end

# Return the Fibonacci number at index n
current
end

# Call the fib function and store the result in a variable
var result = fib(10)

# Print the result
puts "The 10th Fibonacci number is #{result}"
