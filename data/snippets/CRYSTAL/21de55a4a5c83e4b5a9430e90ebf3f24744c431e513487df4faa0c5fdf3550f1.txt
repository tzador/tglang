# This code snippet defines a class called "Person" with attributes "name", "age", and "gender"
class Person
  property name : String
  property age : Int32
  property gender : String

  # This is a method that greets the person by their name and age
  # The method takes in two arguments, "name" and "age", and returns a string
  def greet(name : String, age : Int32) : String
    "Hello, #{name}! You are #{age} years old."
  end

  # This is a method that checks if the person is a male or female
  # The method takes in one argument, "gender", and returns a string
  def check_gender(gender : String) : String
    if gender == "male"
      "#{name} is a male."
    else
      "#{name} is a female."
    end
  end
end

# This code creates an instance of the "Person" class with the name "John", age 25, and gender "male"
john = Person.new
john.name = "John"
john.age = 25
john.gender = "male"

# This code calls the "greet" method on the "john" instance and passes in the name and age arguments
john.greet(john.name, john.age) # Output: Hello, John! You are 25 years old.

# This code calls the "check_gender" method on the "john" instance and passes in the gender argument
john.check_gender(john.gender) # Output: John is a male.
