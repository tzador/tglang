# This is a complex code snippet in the CRYSTAL programming language
# It contains a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

def factorial(n : Int) : Int32
  if n <= 1
    1
  else
    n * factorial(n - 1)
  end
end

# This is a recursive function that calls itself until the base case is reached
# It then returns the calculated factorial value

# Define the value whose factorial we want to calculate
var num = 5

# Call the factorial function and pass in the value
# Print the result to the console
puts "Factorial of #{num} is #{factorial(num)}"

# Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
