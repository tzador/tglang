# Crystal Program to Determine Prime Numbers in an Array

# Define a method to check if a number is prime or not
def is_prime?(n)
  if n <= 1
    return false
  elsif n <= 3
    return true
  elsif n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0
    return false
  end

  i = 5

  # Loop to check for prime
  while i * i <= n
    if n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0
      return false
    end
    i += 6
  end

  return true
end

# Define an array of numbers
numbers = [3, 12, 17, 23, 30, 47, 51]

# Loop through the array and check for prime numbers
numbers.each do |num|
  if is_prime?(num)
    puts "#{num} is prime"
  else
    puts "#{num} is not prime"
  end
end

# Output:
# 3 is prime
# 12 is not prime
# 17 is prime
# 23 is prime
# 30 is not prime
# 47 is prime
# 51 is not prime
