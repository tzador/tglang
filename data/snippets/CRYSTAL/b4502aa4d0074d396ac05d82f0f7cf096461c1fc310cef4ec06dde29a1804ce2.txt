# This is a Crystal program that calculates the factorial of a given number
# It uses recursion to find the factorial of a number
# The input number is stored in a constant

# Define the recursive function to calculate factorial
def factorial(n)
  if n == 0 # Check if input is 0
    return 1
  else
    # Call the function again with one less than the input number
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
  end
end

# Define the constant for input number
INPUT_NUMBER = 6

# Call the factorial function with the input number
result = factorial(INPUT_NUMBER)

# Output the result to the console
puts "The factorial of #{INPUT_NUMBER} is #{result}"
