# This is a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the sum of all the numbers
# in the array.

# This function uses the reduce method to iterate through the array and add each number to the accumulator.
# The accumulator starts at 0 and is updated with each loop iteration.

def sum_of_array(array : Array(Int32)) : Int32
  array.reduce(0) do |accumulator, number|
    accumulator + number
  end
end

# Example usage:
p sum_of_array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # Outputs 15
