# This is a complex function that finds the sum of even numbers in a given array of integers

# define a function named "sum_of_even" that takes in an array of integers called "numbers"
def sum_of_even(numbers)
    # initialize a variable named "sum" to store the sum of even numbers, set it to 0
    sum = 0
    # loop through each number in the array
    for number in numbers
        # check if the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder (even number)
        if number % 2 == 0
            # add the number to the sum variable
            sum += number
        end
    end
    # return the sum of even numbers
    sum
end

# create an array of integers called "input_array"
input_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# call the "sum_of_even" function with the "input_array" as argument and store the result in a variable named "even_sum"
even_sum = sum_of_even(input_array)

# print out the result in a user-friendly format
puts "The sum of even numbers in #{input_array} is #{even_sum}"
