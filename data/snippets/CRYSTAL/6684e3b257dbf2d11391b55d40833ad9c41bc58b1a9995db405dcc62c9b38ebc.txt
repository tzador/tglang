# It uses different data types and control structures

# Define a class named Person with instance variables and methods
class Person

  # Declare instance variables
  property name : String
  property age : Int32
  property occupation : String
  property height : Float32

  # Define a constructor method that takes in parameters for name, age, occupation and height
  def initialize(@name : String, @age : Int32, @occupation : String, @height : Float32)
  end

  # Define a method to calculate the average height of a group of people
  def self.calculate_average_height(people : Array(Person))
    # Initialize a variable to store the total height of all people
    total_height = 0.0

    # Use a loop to iterate through the array of people
    for person in people do
      # Add the height of each person to the total height variable
      total_height += person.height
    end

    # Calculate the average height by dividing the total height by the number of people
    average_height = total_height / people.size

    # Print the average height with a message
    puts "The average height of this group of people is #{average_height}!"

    # Return the average height
    return average_height
  end

  # Define a method to check if a person is of legal drinking age
  def check_legal_drinking_age
    # Use a conditional statement to check if the person's age is greater than or equal to 21
    if age >= 21
      # If true, print a message
      puts "#{name} is of legal drinking age."
    else
      # If false, print a message
      puts "#{name} is not of legal drinking age."
    end
  end
end

# Create three instances of the Person class with different values for the instance variables
person1 = Person.new("John", 28, "Engineer", 183.5)
person2 = Person.new("Rachel", 32, "Doctor", 167.2)
person3 = Person.new("Michael", 19, "Student", 176.8)

# Add all three instances to an array
people = [person1, person2, person3]

# Call the calculate_average_height method on the Person class and pass in the array of people
Person.calculate_average_height(people)

# Call the check_legal_drinking_age method on each person
person1.check_legal_drinking_age
person2.check_legal_drinking_age
person3.check_legal_drinking_age
