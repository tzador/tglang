# Bubble sort algorithm:
# It iterates through the input array and for each iteration, it compares adjacent elements
# and swaps them if the first element is larger than the second.
# The process is repeated until the array is fully sorted in ascending order.

# Example usage:
# arr = [5, 2, 7, 3, 9]
# bubble_sort(arr)
# arr => [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
