# This code snippet is a simple program in the CRYSTAL programming language that takes in user input
# and outputs a greeting message

# Define a class called `Greeting`
class Greeting

  # Define a class method called `greet` that takes in a parameter `name`
  def self.greet(name)
    
    # Add the name to the end of the greeting message
    message = "Hello, #{name}! Welcome to the CRYSTAL programming language."
    
    # Output the message to the console
    puts message
    
  end
  
end

# Ask the user to input their name
print "Enter your name: "

# Store the user input in a variable `user_name`
user_name = gets.chomp

# Call the `greet` method from the `Greeting` class and pass in the `user_name` variable as an argument
Greeting.greet(user_name)

# Output:
# Hello, [user_name]! Welcome to the CRYSTAL programming language.
