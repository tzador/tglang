# This is a code snippet in Crystal programming language

# Defining a class named "Person"
class Person
  # Defining instance variables
  @name : String
  @age : Int32

  # Defining a constructor for Person class
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  # Defining a method to introduce the person
  def introduce
    puts "Hi, I am #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Creating an instance of Person class
person = Person.new("John", 25)

# Calling the introduce method on the person instance
person.introduce

# Output: Hi, I am John and I am 25 years old.
