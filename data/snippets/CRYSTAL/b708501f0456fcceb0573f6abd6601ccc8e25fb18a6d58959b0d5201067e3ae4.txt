# This is a sample program in CRYSTAL

# Define a class called Person
class Person
  # Define instance variables for the person's name and age
  @name : String
  @age : Int32

  # Define a constructor for the Person class
  def initialize(@name, @age)
    # Print a greeting with the person's name and age
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end

  # Define a method to introduce the person
  def introduce
    # Print a message with the person's name and age
    puts "Hi, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create a new instance of the Person class
person = Person.new("John", 25)

# Call the introduce method on the person instance
person.introduce

# Output:
Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
Hi, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
