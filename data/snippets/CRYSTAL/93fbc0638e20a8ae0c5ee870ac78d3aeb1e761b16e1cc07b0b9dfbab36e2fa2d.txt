# This is a function that takes in an array and returns the average value
# of all the elements in the array. The input array must be of type Float32.

  sum = 0.0 # initializes a variable to store the sum of all elements
  for num in array do # iterates through the array
    sum += num # adds each element to the sum
  end
  avg = sum / array.size # divides the sum by the number of elements to get the average
