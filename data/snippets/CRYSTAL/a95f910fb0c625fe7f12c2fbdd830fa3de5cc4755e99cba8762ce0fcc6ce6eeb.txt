# This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
#
# * `num` - The number whose factorial is to be calculated
#
# Examples
#
# factorial(3) # Output: 6
# factorial(5) # Output: 120 
#
def factorial(num : Int32)
  if num == 0
    return 1
  else
    return num * factorial(num - 1)
  end
end

# This is a class that represents a person with a name and age
#
# * `name` - The person's name
# * `age` - The person's age

  end

  # This method greets the person with their name and age
  def greet

# This is an example of using the above function and class
# 
# * `person1` - An instance of Person class
#
person1 = Person.new("John", 25)
puts person1.name # Output: "John"
puts person1.age # Output: 25
