# Basic class example
class Person
    # Initialize is a special method that runs when an instance is created
    def initialize(name, age)
        @name = name
        @age = age
    end

    # Getter method for name
    def name
        @name
    end

    # Setter method for name
    def name=(name)
        @name = name
    end

    # Getter method for age
    def age
        @age
    end

    # Setter method for age
    def age=(age)
        @age = age
    end
    
    # Method to print information about the person
    def print_info
        puts "Name: #{@name}, Age: #{@age}"
    end
end

# Creating an instance of Person class
person = Person.new("John", 25)

# Calling the print_info method
person.print_info

# Output:
# Name: John, Age: 25
