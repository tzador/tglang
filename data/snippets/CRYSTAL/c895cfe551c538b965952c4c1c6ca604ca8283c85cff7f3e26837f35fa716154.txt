# This is an example of a complex code snippet in CRYSTAL

# Define a class named Person with variables name and age
class Person
  property name : String
  property age : Int32

  # Define a constant named GREETING and set its value to "Hello, my name is"
  GREETING = "Hello, my name is"
  
  # Define a method called say_greeting with a parameter 'name'
  def say_greeting(name)
    # Initialize a variable called "full_greeting" and concatenate the constant GREETING and the parameter name
    full_greeting = "#{GREETING} #{name}"
    
    # Print out the full greeting with the person's name and age using string interpolation
    puts "#{full_greeting}. I am #{age} years old."
    
    # If the person is under 18 years old, print a message saying they are too young to greet
    if age < 18
      puts "Sorry, you are too young to greet."
    end
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Person class with the name "John" and the age 25
person = Person.new
person.name = "John"
person.age = 25

# Call the method say_greeting with the person's name as the argument
person.say_greeting(person.name)

# Output:
