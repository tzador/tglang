# This is a complex code snippet written in Crystal programming language

# Define a class named Person
class Person
  # Define instance variables
  @name : String
  @age : Int32
  @hobbies : Array(String)

  # Define a constructor that takes in name, age, and hobbies
  def initialize(@name, @age, @hobbies)
    # Check for valid age
    if @age <= 0 
      raise "Invalid age!"
    end
  end

  # Define a method to print the person's name
  def print_name
    puts "Name: #{@name}"
  end

  # Define a method to add a new hobby to the person's hobby list
  def add_hobby(hobby)
    # Check if hobby already exists
    if @hobbies.include?(hobby)
      puts "#{hobby} is already a hobby"
    else 
      @hobbies << hobby
      puts "#{hobby} added to hobbies"
    end
  end

  # Define a method to print all of the person's hobbies
  def print_hobbies
    puts "#{@name}'s Hobbies:"
    # Loop through hobbies array and print each hobby
    for hobby in @hobbies
      puts "- #{hobby}"
    end
  end
end

# Create a new instance of Person 
person = Person.new("John", 25, ["reading", "hiking"])

# Call methods on the person object
person.print_name
person.add_hobby("drawing")
person.print_hobbies

# Output:
# Name: John
# drawing added to hobbies
# John's Hobbies:
# - reading
# - hiking
# - drawing
