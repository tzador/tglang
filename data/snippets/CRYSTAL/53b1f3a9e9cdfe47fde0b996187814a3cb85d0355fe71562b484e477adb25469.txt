# This is a simple example of a CRYSTAL code snippet

# Define a class named Person with two attributes, name and age
class Person
  @name : String
  @age : Int32

  # Define a constructor that takes in a name and age and sets them as attributes
  def initialize(name : String, age : Int32)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  # Define a method that greets the person by name and returns their age
  def greet
    return "Hello, #{@name}! You are #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Person class and pass in a name and age
person = Person.new("John", 25)

# Call the greet method on the person instance and assign the output to a variable
greeting = person.greet

# Print the greeting to the console
puts greeting

# Output:
# Hello, John! You are 25 years old.
