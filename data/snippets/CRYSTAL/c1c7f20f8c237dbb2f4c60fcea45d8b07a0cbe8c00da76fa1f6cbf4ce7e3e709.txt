# This code snippet is a Crystal program that calculates the sum of two numbers
# and prints the result to the console.

# Declare a method called "sum" that takes in two arguments, "num1" and "num2"
def sum(num1, num2)
  # Declare a local variable "result" and assign it the value of the sum of "num1" and "num2"
  result = num1 + num2
  # Print the result to the console
  puts "The sum of #{num1} and #{num2} is #{result}."
  # Return the value of "result"
  return result
end

# Prompt the user for two numbers and store them in variables "a" and "b"
puts "Enter the first number:"
a = gets
puts "Enter the second number:"
b = gets

# Convert the input values from strings to integers
a = a.to_i
b = b.to_i

# Call the "sum" method with the variables "a" and "b" as arguments
result = sum(a, b)

# Print the result to the console
puts "The final result is #{result}."
