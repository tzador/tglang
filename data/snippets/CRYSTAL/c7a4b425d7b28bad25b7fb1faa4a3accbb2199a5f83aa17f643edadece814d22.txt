class Calculator

  # This is a class used for performing mathematical calculations

  # Defining a class variable `result` with initial value 0
  @result = 0

  # Creates a method that takes in two numbers and adds them together
  def self.add(num1, num2)
    @result = num1 + num2
  end

  # Creates a method that takes in two numbers and subtracts the second number from the first
  def self.subtract(num1, num2)
    @result = num1 - num2
  end

  # Creates a method that takes in two numbers and multiplies them together
  def self.multiply(num1, num2)
    @result = num1 * num2
  end

  # Creates a method that takes in two numbers and divides the first number by the second number
  def self.divide(num1, num2)
    @result = num1 / num2
  end

  # Prints out the current value of the `result` variable
  def self.print_result
    puts "The result is #{@result}"
  end
end

# Using the `Calculator` class
# Calling the `add` method with two numbers 10 and 5
Calculator.add(10, 5)
# Calling the `print_result` method to output the result

Calculator.subtract(8, 4)
# Calling the `print_result` method to output the result
Calculator.print_result

# Calling the `multiply` method with two numbers 3 and 5
Calculator.multiply(3, 5)
# Calling the `print_result` method to output the result
Calculator.print_result

# Calling the `divide` method with two numbers 12 and 6
Calculator.divide(12, 6)
# Calling the `print_result` method to output the result
Calculator.print_result
