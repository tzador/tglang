# This is a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number
# Based on the golden ratio formula

# Define the function with a parameter for n
def fibonacci(n)

  # Create an array to store the sequence
  sequence = Array(Int32).new

  # Loop through n to generate the sequence
  for i in 1..n
    # Check if i is less than 2 
    if i < 2
      # If so, add i to the sequence
      sequence << i
    else
      # Otherwise, use the golden ratio formula to calculate the Fibonacci number 
      # and add it to the sequence
      sequence << sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2]
    end
  end

  # Return the nth Fibonacci number
  return sequence[n - 1]
  
end

# Call the function with an input of 10
fibonacci(10)

# Output: 55
