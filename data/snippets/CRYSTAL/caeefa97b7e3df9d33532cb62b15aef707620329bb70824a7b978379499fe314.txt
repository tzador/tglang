# This is a complex function that calculates the factorial of a given number

# Input:
# - a - the number whose factorial is to be calculated

# Output:
# - result - the factorial of the given number

func factorial(a)
  # initialize result variable
  result = 1
  # loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number
  for i in 1..a
    # multiply the current result with the current number
    result = result * i
  end
  # return the final result
  return result
end

# Call the factorial function and print the result for the number 5
puts factorial(5) # Output: 120
