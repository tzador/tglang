# A function that calculates the factorial of a given number in CRYSTAL

# Create a function that takes in a number as an argument
def factorial(number)
  # Initialize a variable to hold the factorial value
  result = 1

  # Use a loop to iterate from 1 to the given number
  for i in 1..number
    # Multiply the current factorial value with the current number
    result *= i
  end

  # Return the factorial value
  return result
end

# Output the factorial of 5
puts factorial(5)
# Output: 120
