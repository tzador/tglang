# This is a sample code snippet in the CRYSTAL programming language

# Declare a class called "Person"
class Person
  # Initialize class variables
  from : String
  age : Int

  # Define a constructor method
  def initialize(from, age)
    # Set instance variables
    @from = from
    @age = age
  end

  # Define a method to print person's information
  def print_info
    puts "I am from #{@from} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create a new instance of Person class
person = Person.new("Crystal City", 25)

# Call the print_info method to print person's information
person.print_info

# Output: 'I am from Crystal City and I am 25 years old.'
