# This is a code snippet in Crystal, a statically typed, compiled programming language
# Here we are defining a class called Player
class Player
  # Initializing instance variables for Player class
  # These variables will be automatically set when a new Player object is created
  @name : String
  @score : Int32
  @level : Int32

  # Defining a constructor for Player class
  # This constructor takes in a player name and sets the instance variable @name to that value
  # It also sets the instance variable @score to 0 and @level to 1 by default
  def initialize(@name)
    @score = 0
    @level = 1
  end

  # Defining instance methods for Player class
  # These methods can be called on a specific Player object
  # This method increases the player's score by the given amount
  def increase_score(amount : Int32)
    @score += amount
  end

  # This method increases the player's level by 1
  def increase_level
    @level += 1
  end
end

# Creating a new Player object named "John"
player = Player.new("John")

# Calling the increase_score method on the "John" object with an input of 10
player.increase_score(10)

# Calling the increase_level method on the "John" object
player.increase_level
