# This code snippet uses the Crystal programming language to create a mathematical function that calculates the factorial of a number.

# Declare a function named "factorial" that takes in one argument, "n" of type Int32 (integer) and returns a value of type Int32.
def factorial(n : Int32) : Int32

  # Declare a variable "result" of type Int32 and assign it a value of 1.
  result = 1

  # Use a for loop to iterate through the values of "n", starting from 1 up to and including "n".
  for i in 1..n do

    # Multiply "result" by "i" and assign the product back to "result".
    result *= i

  # End the for loop.
  end

  # Return the final value of "result" as the output of the factorial function.
  result

# Call the factorial function with a value of 5 and print the result to the console.
puts factorial(5)

# Output: 120 (i.e. 5! = 120)
