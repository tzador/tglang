# Example of a complex code snippet in CRYSTAL

# Defining a class called `Book`
class Book
  # Initializing instance variables
  @title : String
  @author : String
  @price : Float32
  @publish_date : Date

  # Defining a constructor method
  def initialize(title, author, price, publish_date)
    # Assigning values to instance variables
    @title = title
    @author = author
    @price = price
    @publish_date = publish_date
  end

  # Defining a getter method for the title
  def title
    # Returning the value of the instance variable title
    @title
  end

  # Defining a setter method for the price
  def price=(new_price)
    # Updating the value of the instance variable price
    @price = new_price
  end

  # Defining a method to calculate the total cost of a book
  def total_cost(quantity)
    # Multiplying the price by the quantity and returning the result
    @price * quantity
  end
end

# Creating an instance of the `Book` class
book = Book.new("Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", "J.K. Rowling", 15.99, Date.new(1997, 6, 26))

# Printing the title of the book
puts book.title

# Updating the price of the book to 17.99
book.price = 17.99

# Printing the total cost of 5 copies of the book
puts book.total_cost(5)
