# This is a program that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
# To run the program, replace the value of 'num' variable with the desired number and run the code

# Declare a function to calculate factorial using recursion
def factorial(num : Int32) : Int64
  if num == 0
    return 1
  else
    return num * factorial(num - 1) # recursive call to the function with updated value
  end
end

# Declare a variable to store the user input
num : Int32

# Get user input for 'num' variable
puts "Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "
num = gets.to_i

# Call the 'factorial' function and store the result in a variable
result : Int64 = factorial(num)

# Print the result
puts "The factorial of #{num} is #{result}"

# Output:
# Enter a number to calculate its factorial:
# 5
# The factorial of 5 is 120
