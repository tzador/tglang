# This program calculates the factorial of a given number

# Define variable to store user input
# Note: variables are declared using `var` keyword in Crystal
var number : Int32

# Prompt user for input and convert to integer
puts "Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "

# Define function to calculate factorial
# Note: functions are defined using `def` keyword in Crystal
# `UInt64` is used to provide a larger range for the result
def factorial(n : Int32) : UInt64
    # Base case
    if n == 0
        # Return 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
        return 1
    # Recursive case
    else
        # Multiply current number with the factorial of (n-1) recursively
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Call function and store result in a variable

# Print result to console
puts "The factorial of #{number} is #{result}"

# Output: The factorial of #{number} is #{result}
