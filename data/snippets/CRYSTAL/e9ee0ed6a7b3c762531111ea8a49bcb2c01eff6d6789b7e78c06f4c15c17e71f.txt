# This is a class for generating a Fibonacci sequence
class Fibonacci 
  # Initializing the sequence with 0 and 1
  def initialize
    @sequence = [0, 1]
  end

  # Method to generate the next number in the sequence
  def next 
    # Using the formula for Fibonacci sequence: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
    next_number = @sequence[-1] + @sequence[-2]
    
    # Adding the next number to the sequence
    @sequence << next_number
    
    # Returning the next number in the sequence
    return next_number
  end

  # Method to generate the sequence up to a given length, starting from 1
  def up_to(length)
    # Using a while loop to generate the sequence
    while @sequence.length < length
      # Calling the 'next' method to get the next number in the sequence
      self.next

# Creating an instance of the Fibonacci class

# Calling the 'up_to' method to generate a sequence of length 10
fibonacci.up_to(10)

This will output the following sequence:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

# Calling the 'next' method to generate the next number in the sequence
fibonacci.next
# This will output: 55
