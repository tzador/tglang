# This program generates a random sequence of numbers and determines the sum of the sequence

# Define a constant for the length of the sequence
CONST MAX_LENGTH = 10

# Create an array to store the sequence

# Define a method to generate a random number between 1 and 10, inclusive
def generate_random_number
  return rand(1..10)
end

# Define a method to generate the sequence
def generate_sequence
  for i in 0..MAX_LENGTH-1
    RANDOM_SEQUENCE << generate_random_number
  end
end

# Print the randomly generated sequence
puts "Generated Sequence is #{RANDOM_SEQUENCE}"

# Define a variable to store the sum of the sequence

# Calculate the sum of the sequence using a loop
for num in RANDOM_SEQUENCE
  sum += num
end

# Print the sum of the sequence
puts "Sum of the sequence is #{sum}"
