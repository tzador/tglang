# This is a CRYSTAL code snippet
# It generates a random number and prints its square

# Import the library for random number generation
require "random"

# Generate a random number between 1 and 10 and store it in a variable
random_num = Random.new.rand(1..10)

# Define a method to calculate square of a number
def square(num)
  return num * num
end

# Print the random number and its square
puts "Random number: #{random_num}"
puts "Square of random number: #{square(random_num)}"
