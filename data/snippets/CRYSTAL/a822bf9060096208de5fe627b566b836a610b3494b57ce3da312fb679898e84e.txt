CONSTANT STRING = "Crystal is a versatile and powerful programming language that runs on the LLVM virtual machine. It combines the speed of C with the productivity of a high-level language, making it a top choice for developing fast, scalable, and reliable software. In this code snippet, we will create a class called Person that has three properties: name, age, and occupation."
