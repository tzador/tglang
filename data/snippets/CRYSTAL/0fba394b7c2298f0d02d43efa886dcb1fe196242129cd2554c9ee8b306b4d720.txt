# This is a function that implements the mathematical concept of the Fibonacci sequence
# The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1
# Our function takes in an integer n as its argument and returns the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence

def fib(n : Int32) : Int32

  if n == 1 # if n is 1, the first term in the sequence is 0, so we return 0
    return 0
  else if n == 2 # if n is 2, the second term in the sequence is 1, so we return 1
    return 1
  else
    # otherwise, we recursively call the fib function, passing in n-1 and n-2 as arguments and add the results
    # this is the core logic of the Fibonacci sequence
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
  end
end

# example function call to calculate the 10th term in the Fibonacci sequence
fib(10) # returns 34 as the 10th term in the sequence is 34
