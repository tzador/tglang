# This is a code snippet written in the CRYSTAL programming language.
# It is a complex example of a function that generates a Fibonacci sequence.

# This is a function that takes in an integer and returns a list of Fibonacci sequence numbers up to that integer.

def fibonacci(input : Int) : Array(Int32)

  # Define an empty array to store the Fibonacci numbers.
  array = Array(Int32).new

  # Add the first two numbers of the sequence to the array.
  array << 0
  array << 1

  # Loop through the remaining numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
  for i in 2..(input-1)

    # The next number in the sequence is equal to the sum of the previous two numbers.
    new_number = array[i-1] + array[i-2]

    # Add the new number to the array.
    array << new_number
  end

  # Return the array containing the Fibonacci sequence.
  return array
end

# Call the function and pass in the number 10 as the input.
fibonacci(10)

# Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
