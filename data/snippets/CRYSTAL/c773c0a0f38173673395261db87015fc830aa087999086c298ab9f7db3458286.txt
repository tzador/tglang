# Define a class with a constructor that takes in a string and integer
class Person(name : String, age : Int32)
  # Instance variables
  @name : String
  @age : Int32

  # Constructor
  def initialize(@name, @age)
    puts "Creating a new person named #{@name} who is #{@age} years old!"
  end

  # Getter method for name
  def name
    @name
  end

  # Setter method for age
  def age=(new_age)
    @age = new_age
  end

  # Instance method to greet the person
  def greet
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I'm #{@age} years old!"
  end
end

# Create an instance of the Person class
person = Person.new("John", 28)

# Call the greet method
person.greet

# Change the age of the person
person.age = 32

# Call the name getter method
puts person.name

# Output:

# Creating a new person named John who is 28 years old!
# Hello, my name is John and I'm 28 years old!
