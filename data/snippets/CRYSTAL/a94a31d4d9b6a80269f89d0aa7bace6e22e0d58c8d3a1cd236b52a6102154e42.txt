# This is a complex code snippet in CRYSTAL programming language
# It creates a recursive function that prints the Fibonacci sequence
# up to the given number

# Define the function with two parameters: previous number and current number
def fib(prev, curr)
  # Base case: if current number is greater than the given number, stop recursive calls
  if curr > given_number
    return
  # Print the current number and call the function again,
  # with current number as the new previous number and the sum of previous and current as the new current number
  else
    puts curr
    fib(curr, prev + curr)
  end
end

# Get input from the user for the max number in the sequence
puts "Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to print:"
given_number = gets.chomp.to_i

# Call the function with the initial values of 0 and 1
fib(0, 1)

# Output:
# Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to print:
# 10
# 1
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 5
# 8
# 13
# 21
# 34
# 55
