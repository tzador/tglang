# This is a CRYSTAL code snippet that contains a function for calculating Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit
#
def fibonacci(limit : Int32)
    # create an array to store the Fibonacci sequence
    fib = Array(Int32).new

    # set first two values of the sequence
    fib[0] = 0 
    fib[1] = 1 

    # loop through the rest of the sequence
    (2..limit).each do |i|
        # calculate the next value in the sequence
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
    end

    # print out the Fibonacci sequence
    fib.each do |n|
        puts "#{n} "
    end
end

# call the function and pass in a limit value
fibonacci(10)
