# This is a complex code snippet in CRYSTAL language
# It includes multiple functions and control structures
# Note: this is just an example and does not do anything meaningful

# Define a function called "calculator" which takes in two arguments
def calculator(x, y)
  # Create variables for the sum, difference, and product of the arguments
  sum = x + y
  diff = x - y
  product = x * y

  # Use conditional statements to check for edge cases
  if x == 0 or y == 0
    puts "Error: Cannot calculate with 0"
  elsif y < 0
    puts "Error: Cannot calculate with a negative number"
  else
    # Output the calculated results
    puts "Sum: #{sum}"
    puts "Difference: #{diff}"
    puts "Product: #{product}"
    return sum, diff, product
  end
end

# Call the calculator function with arguments 10 and 5
calculator(10, 5)
