# Creating two Person objects

# Calling the greet method of person1
person1.greet # Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.

# Comparing the two Person objects
Person.compare(person1, person2) # Output: John is older than Emily.

# Changing the age of person2 using the setter method
person2.age = 35

# Calling the greet method of person2
person2.greet # Output: Hello, my name is Emily and I am 35 years old.
