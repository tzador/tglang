# This is a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using bubble sort algorithm
# Inputs: arr - an array of integers
# Output: A sorted array in ascending order
def bubble_sort(arr)
  length = arr.size # get the size of the array
  swapped = true  # a variable to keep track if elements have been swapped
  while swapped do # loop while elements have been swapped
    swapped = false # reset the swapped variable
    for i in 0...length-1 # loop through the array
      if arr[i] > arr[i+1] # compare current element with next element
        arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i] # swap elements if first is bigger
        swapped = true # set swapped to true
      end
    end
  end
  arr # return sorted array
end

# Example input and output
arr = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1]
sorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr) # returns [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
