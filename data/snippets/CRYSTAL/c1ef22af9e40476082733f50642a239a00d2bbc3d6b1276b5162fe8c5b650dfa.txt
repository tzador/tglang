# Define a class called "Person" with two properties, "name" and "age"
class Person
  property name : String
  property age : Int32
end

# Initialize a new instance of the "Person" class with name "John" and age "30"
person = Person.new
person.name = "John"
person.age = 30

# Create a function called "greet" with a parameter named "person"
def greet(person)
  puts "Hello #{person.name}, you are #{person.age} years old."
end

# Call the "greet" function and pass in the "person" instance as an argument
