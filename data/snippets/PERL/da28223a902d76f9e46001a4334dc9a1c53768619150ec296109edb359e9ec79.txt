# This program will print out the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence

# Define variables for first two numbers in sequence
$x = 0; 
$y = 1; 

# Print first two numbers and add them
print "$x\n"; 
print "$y\n"; 
$z = $x + $y; 

# Use a for loop to iterate through the sequence and print the next 8 numbers
for ($i = 2; $i < 10; $i++) {

    # Print the current number in the sequence
    print "$z\n";

    # Reassign variables to next two numbers in sequence
    $x = $y;

    # Add the two numbers to get the next in the sequence
    $z = $x + $y;

# Output:
# 0
