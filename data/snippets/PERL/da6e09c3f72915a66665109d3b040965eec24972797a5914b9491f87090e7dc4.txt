# This is a Perl code snippet that creates a hash and iterates through its keys and values
# Initializing the hash with some key-value pairs
my %hash = (
    key1 => "value1",
    key2 => "value2",
    key3 => "value3",
);

# Iterating through the keys and values of the hash using a for loop
for my $key (keys %hash) {
    # Printing the key and corresponding value
    print "$key => $hash{$key}\n";
}

# Output:
# key1 => value1
# key2 => value2
# key3 => value3
