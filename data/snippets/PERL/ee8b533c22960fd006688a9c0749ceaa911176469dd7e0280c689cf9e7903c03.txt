# This code snippet defines a function
# that calculates the square root of a number
# using the Newton-Raphson method
sub square_root {
    my ($number) = @_; # Takes in one parameter, the number to calculate the square root of
    my $guess = $number / 2; # Initial guess is half of the number

    # Loop until the guess is accurate to 6 decimal places
    while (abs($guess ** 2 - $number) > 0.000001) {
        $guess = ($guess + $number / $guess) / 2; # Calculate the next guess using the Newton-Raphson formula
    }

    return $guess; # Return the final guess as the square root of the number
}

# Call the function with an input number and print the result
print "Square root of 5 is: " . square_root(5) . "\n";

# Output:
# Square root of 5 is: 2.23606797749979
