# This is a Perl program that takes two numbers from the user and prints their sum

# Using strict pragma to enforce good programming practices
use strict;

# Defining variables with 'my' keyword
my $firstNumber;
my $secondNumber;
my $sum;

# Prompting user to enter first number
print "Enter first number: ";

# Using chomp function to remove newline character
chomp($firstNumber = <STDIN>);

# Prompting user to enter second number
print "Enter second number: ";

# Using chomp function to remove newline character
chomp($secondNumber = <STDIN>);

# Calculating the sum
$sum = $firstNumber + $secondNumber;

# Printing the result
print "The sum of $firstNumber and $secondNumber is $sum.";
