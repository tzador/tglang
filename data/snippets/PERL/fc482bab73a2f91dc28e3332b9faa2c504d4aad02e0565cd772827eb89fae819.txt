## This code snippet calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

# Set up starting values of the sequence
my $prev_num = 0;
my $current_num = 1;

# Get input from user for the desired number of sequence
print "Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: ";
my $num_terms = <STDIN>;
chomp $num_terms;

# Loop through and calculate each term in the sequence
for (my $i = 1; $i <= $num_terms; $i++) {
    # Print current number in sequence
    print "$current_num ";

    # Calculate next number in sequence by adding previous two numbers
    my $next_num = $prev_num + $current_num;

    # Assign current number to previous number
    $prev_num = $current_num;

    # Assign next number to current number for next iteration
    $current_num = $next_num;
