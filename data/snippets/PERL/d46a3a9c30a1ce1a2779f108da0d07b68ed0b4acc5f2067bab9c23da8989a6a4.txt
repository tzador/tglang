use strict; ## tells the compiler to enforce some strict rules for coding 

my $num1; ## declaring a variable named num1
my $num2; ## declaring a variable named num2

print "Enter first number: "; ## prompts the user to enter the first number
$num1 = <STDIN>; ## assigns the input from user to num1 variable

print "Enter second number: "; ## prompts the user to enter the second number
$num2 = <STDIN>; ## assigns the input from user to num2 variable

my $result = $num1 + $num2; ## declaring a variable named result and assigning the sum of num1 and num2 to it

print "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $result\n"; ## prints the sum of num1 and num2
