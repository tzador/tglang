# This code snippet is written in Perl and calculates the factorial of a given number
# The input is taken from the user
# The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number
# For example, the factorial of 4 is 4*3*2*1 = 24

# Taking input from the user
print "Enter a number: ";
$number = <STDIN>;
chomp $number; # Removes any newline character at the end

# Initializing the factorial to 1
$factorial = 1;

# Calculating the factorial using a for loop
for($i=1; $i <= $number ; $i++){
    $factorial = $factorial * $i;
}

# Printing the result
print "Factorial of $number is $factorial";
