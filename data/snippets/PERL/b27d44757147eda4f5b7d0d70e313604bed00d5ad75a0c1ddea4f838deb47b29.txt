# Create a subroutine to calculate the factorial of a given number.
# The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number.
sub factorial {
    my $num = shift; # declare a variable to store the given number
    my $result = 1; # initialize the result variable
    for(my $i = 1; $i <= $num; $i++) { # loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number
        $result *= $i; # multiply the result by the current number
    }
    return $result; # return the factorial of the given number
}

# Call the subroutine with the number 5 and print the result
print factorial(5); # output: 120 (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120)
