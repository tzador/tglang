# This code snippet represents a basic calculator program in PERL

# Declaring variables to store user input of numbers
my $num1;
my $num2;

# Prompt user to enter first number
print "Enter first number: ";

# Taking input from user using standard input stream (STDIN) and removing new line character using chomp function
chomp($num1 = <STDIN>);

# Prompt user to enter second number
print "Enter second number: ";

# Taking input from user and removing new line character
chomp($num2 = <STDIN>);

# Performing addition operation and storing the result in a variable
my $result = $num1 + $num2;

# Displaying the result to the user with appropriate message
print "Addition of $num1 and $num2 is: $result\n";

# Performing subtraction operation and storing the result in a variable
$result = $num1 - $num2;

# Displaying the result to the user with appropriate message
print "Subtraction of $num1 and $num2 is: $result\n";

# Performing multiplication operation and storing the result in a variable
$result = $num1 * $num2;

# Displaying the result to the user with appropriate message
print "Multiplication of $num1 and $num2 is: $result\n";

# Performing division operation and storing the result in a variable
$result = $num1 / $num2;

# Displaying the result to the user with appropriate message
print "Division of $num1 and $num2 is: $result\n";

# End of the program
# There is no need to explicitly close the standard output stream as it is automatically closed
