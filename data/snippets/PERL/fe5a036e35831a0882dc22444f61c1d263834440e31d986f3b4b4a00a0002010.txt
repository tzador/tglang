# This code snippet generates the first ten terms of the Fibonacci sequence

# Declare an array to store the sequence
my @fibonacci = (0, 1);

# Use a for loop to generate the first ten terms
for(my $i = 2; $i < 10; $i++) {
    # Calculate the next term by summing the previous two terms
    $fibonacci[$i] = $fibonacci[$i-1] + $fibonacci[$i-2];
}

# Print out the array in a readable format
print "The first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:\n";

# Use a foreach loop to iterate through the array and print out each term
foreach my $term (@fibonacci) {
    print "$term ";
}

# Output:
#
# The first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:
# 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
