# This code snippet uses the strict and warnings pragmas to enforce proper coding practices
use strict;  # Cause compilation errors for undeclared variables

# Declare a subroutine with two parameters
sub add_numbers {
    my ($num1, $num2) = @_;  # Use 'my' keyword to declare and assign variables 
    my $sum = $num1 + $num2;  # Perform addition and store in new variable
    return $sum;  # Return the sum
}

# Create an array with three numbers
my @numbers = (5, 10, 15);

# Use a foreach loop to iterate through the array and call the subroutine on each pair of numbers
foreach my $num (@numbers) {
    my $result = add_numbers($num, $num+5);  # Assign return value of subroutine to a new variable 
    print "$result\n";  # Print the result to the console
