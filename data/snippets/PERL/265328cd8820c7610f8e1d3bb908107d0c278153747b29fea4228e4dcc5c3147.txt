# This is a complex Perl code snippet that uses advanced concepts like regular expressions and file handling.

# Declare and initialize a hash variable
my %data = (
    "John" => "Doe",
    "Jane" => "Smith",
    "Alice" => "Johnson",
    "Bob" => "Brown"
);

# Open a file for writing
open(my $fh, ">", "output.txt") or die "Could not open file: $!";

# Iterate through the keys and values in the hash
foreach my $key (keys %data) {
    my $name = "$key $data{$key}";
    # Use regular expressions to check if the name starts with a vowel
    if($name =~ /^[aeiou]/i) {
        # Print the name in uppercase to the file
        print $fh uc($name) . "\n";
    }
}

# Close the file
close($fh);
