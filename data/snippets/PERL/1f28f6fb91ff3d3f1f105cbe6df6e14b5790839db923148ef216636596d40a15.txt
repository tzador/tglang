## Code to find the average of an array of numbers ##
# Initialize the array with numbers
my @numbers = (9, 18, 7, 21, 3, 14, 5, 11, 16, 24);

# Calculate the size of the array
my $size = scalar(@numbers);

# Initialize the sum as 0
my $sum = 0;

# Loop through the array to add all numbers
for(my $i = 0; $i < $size; $i++) {
    $sum += $numbers[$i];
}

# Calculate the average
my $average = $sum / $size;

# Print the result
print "The average is: $average \n";
