# Define a subroutine named "factorial"
sub factorial{

    my $factorial = 1; #initialize factorial value to 1
    for (my $i = 1; $i <= $n; $i++){ #for loop to iterate through numbers up to n
        $factorial *= $i; #updating the factorial value by multiplying with next number in sequence
    }
    return $factorial; #return the final computed factorial value
}

print "Enter a number: "; #prompting user for input
my $num = <STDIN>; #reading user input from standard input and storing in a variable
chomp $num; #removing newline character from input

print "Factorial of $num is: " . factorial($num) . "\n"; #calling the factorial subroutine and printing the result

# Output:
# Enter a number: 5
# Factorial of 5 is: 120
