# This is a comment.
# This code snippet creates a calculator program in Perl.
# It takes two numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations on them.

# User inputs the first number
print "Enter first number: ";
my $num1 = <STDIN>;
chomp $num1;

# User inputs the second number
print "Enter second number: ";
my $num2 = <STDIN>;

# Add the two numbers
my $sum = $num1 + $num2;

# Subtract the two numbers
my $difference = $num1 - $num2;

# Multiply the two numbers
my $product = $num1 * $num2;

# Divide the first number by the second number
my $quotient = $num1 / $num2;

# Modulus of the two numbers
my $modulus = $num1 % $num2;

# Print out the results
