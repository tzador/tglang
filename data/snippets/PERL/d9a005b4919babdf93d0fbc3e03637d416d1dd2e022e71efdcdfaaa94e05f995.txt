## Function to find and replace a given string in a file
sub find_replace {
    my $file = shift; ## stores the filename as input
    my $find = shift; ## stores the string to find
    my $replace = shift; ## stores the string to replace with
    if (-e $file){ ## checks if the file exists
        open (my $fh, '<', $file) or die "Cannot open file $file: $!"; ## opens the file for reading
        my @lines = <$fh>; ## reads all lines in the file and stores them in an array
        close $fh; ## closes the file
        open ($fh, '>', $file) or die "Cannot open file $file: $!"; ## opens the file for writing
        foreach my $line (@lines) { ## iterates through each line in the array
            $line =~ s/$find/$replace/g; ## performs the find and replace operation using regex
            print $fh $line; ## prints the updated line to the file
        }
        close $fh; ## closes the file
        return 1; ## returns 1 to indicate successful execution of the function
