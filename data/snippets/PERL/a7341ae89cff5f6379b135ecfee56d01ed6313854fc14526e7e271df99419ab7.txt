# This code snippet creates a subroutine that calculates the factorial of a given number
# The subroutine takes in one argument, the number to calculate the factorial for
# The output is the calculated factorial value
sub calculate_factorial {
  my $num = $_[0]; # store argument in $num variable
  my $factorial = 1; # initialize factorial variable to 1
  for (my $i = 1; $i <= $num; $i++) { # loop through numbers from 1 to given number
    $factorial *= $i; # multiply factorial by current number
  }
  return $factorial; # return the calculated factorial value
