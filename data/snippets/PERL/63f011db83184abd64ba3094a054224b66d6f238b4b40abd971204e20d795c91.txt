## This code snippet will generate a simple calculator using Perl ##
 
# create a variable to store the first number
my $num1 = 10;
# create a variable to store the second number 
my $num2 = 5;
 
# create a function for addition
sub add {
    my ($n1, $n2) = @_; # using the parameters passed from the main program
    my $sum = $n1 + $n2; # calculate the sum
    return $sum; # return the result
}

# create a function for subtraction
sub subtract {
    my ($n1, $n2) = @_;
    my $diff = $n1 - $n2;
    return $diff;
}

# create a function for multiplication
sub multiply {
    my ($n1, $n2) = @_;
    my $product = $n1 * $n2;
    return $product;
}

# create a function for division
sub divide {
    my ($n1, $n2) = @_;
    my $quotient = $n1 / $n2;
    return $quotient;
}

# print out the calculations
print "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is ";
print add($num1, $num2). "\n";

print "The difference between $num1 and $num2 is ";
print subtract($num1, $num2) . "\n";

print "The product of $num1 and $num2 is ";
print multiply($num1, $num2) . "\n";

print "The quotient of $num1 and $num2 is ";
print divide($num1, $num2) . "\n";
