# This program calculates the factorial of a given number

# Prompt user for input
print "Enter a number: ";

# Get input from user
my $num = <STDIN>;

# Initialize factorial variable
my $factorial = 1;

# Loop through numbers from 1 to input number
for(my $i=1; $i<=$num; $i++) {

    # Multiply current number with factorial variable
    $factorial *= $i;
}

# Print result
print "Factorial of $num is $factorial";
