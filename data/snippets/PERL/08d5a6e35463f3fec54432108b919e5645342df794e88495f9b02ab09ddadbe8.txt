# This code is a function in PERL that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number.

sub factorial {
    # Takes in a number as an argument
    my $num = shift;

    # Base case: if number is 0 or 1, return 1
    if ($num == 0 || $num == 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    # Recursive call to function with one less than the given number
    my $result = factorial($num - 1);

    # Multiply the result with the given number
    $result = $result * $num;

    # Return the result
    return $result;
}

# Example usage: calculate the factorial of 6
my $num = 6;
my $factorial = factorial($num); # should return 720

# Print the factorial
print "Factorial of $num is $factorial";
