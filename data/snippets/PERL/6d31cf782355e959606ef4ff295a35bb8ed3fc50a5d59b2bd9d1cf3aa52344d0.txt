# This is a code snippet in PERL
# It is a complex expression that calculates the square root of a user-inputted number
# It first checks if the input is a positive number
# If it is, it then uses the built-in function 'sqrt' to calculate the square root
# Otherwise, it prints an error message

print "Enter a number: "; # prompts user for input
my $num = <STDIN>; # reads user input and stores it in variable $num
chomp $num; # removes newline character from input
if($num > 0){ # checks if input is a positive number
    my $sqrt = sqrt($num); # calculates square root using built-in function 'sqrt'
    print "The square root of $num is $sqrt\n"; # prints the result
} else {
    print "Error: Please enter a positive number\n"; # prints error message if input is not positive
}
