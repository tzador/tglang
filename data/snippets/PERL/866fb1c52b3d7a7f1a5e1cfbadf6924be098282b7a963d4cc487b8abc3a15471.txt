# This code snippet is written in Perl, a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted programming language.
# It contains a variable, subroutine, conditional statement, and a loop.

my $num = 10; # Declare and assign the value 10 to the variable $num

# Define a subroutine called "print_num"
sub print_num{
  my $num; # Declare a new local variable $num
  if($num > 5){ # Check if the local variable $num is greater than 5
    print "The value of num is greater than 5\n"; # Print a message if the condition is true
  } else {
    print "The value of num is less than or equal to 5\n"; # Print a message if the condition is false
  }
}

print_num(); # Call the subroutine

# Use a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10
for(my $i=1; $i<=$num; $i++){
  print "$i\n"; # Print the value of $i
}
