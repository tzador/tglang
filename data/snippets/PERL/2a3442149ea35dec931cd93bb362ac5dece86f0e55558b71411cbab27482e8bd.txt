# This is a simple Perl program that calculates the sum of two numbers input by the user

# Declare and initialize variables to hold user inputs
my $num1;
my $num2;

# Prompt user for input and store in variables
print "Enter the first number: ";
chomp($num1 = <STDIN>);
print "Enter the second number: ";
chomp($num2 = <STDIN>);

# Convert strings to numbers and calculate the sum
my $sum = $num1 + $num2;

# Print the result to the user
print "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum.";
