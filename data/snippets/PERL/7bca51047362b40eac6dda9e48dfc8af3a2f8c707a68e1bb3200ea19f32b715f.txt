# This code snippet uses regular expressions to find and replace patterns in a string of text

# Input string
my $text = "Hello, my name is John and I am from New York.";

# Regular expression to find a name in the string
my $regex = qr/\b[A-Z][a-z]+\b/;

# Use the sub function to replace "John" with "Jane"
$text =~ s/$regex/Jane/;

# Print the updated string
print $text;

# Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I am from New York.
