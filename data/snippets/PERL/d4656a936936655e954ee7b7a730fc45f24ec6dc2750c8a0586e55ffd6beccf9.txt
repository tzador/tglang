## Calculating Factorial in Perl
## This program takes in a number from the user and calculates its factorial using recursion
##inputting the number to calculate
print "Enter a number to calculate its factorial: ";
##using <> to get user input 
my $num = <>; 
my $factorial = factorial($num); ##calling the factorial function

#function to calculate factorial using recursion
sub factorial {
    my ($n) = @_; ##use of the special variable @_
    if ($n == 1) { ##terminating condition
        return 1; 
    } else { 
        return $n * factorial($n - 1); ##recursive call
    }
}

print "The factorial of $num is $factorial";
