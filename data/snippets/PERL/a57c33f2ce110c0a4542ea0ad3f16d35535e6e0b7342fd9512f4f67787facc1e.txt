# This code is a simple program to print the first 10 odd numbers using a for loop

for ($i = 1; $i <= 20; $i++) {
    if ($i % 2 != 0) {    # checks if number is odd
        print "$i\n";     # prints the number on a new line
    }
    last if $i == 20;      # exits the loop after 10th odd number is printed
