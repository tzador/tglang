## This code snippet uses a regular expression to validate an email address

my $email = "example123@email.com";

if ($email =~ /\A[\w\.\-]+\@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,4}\z/) { 
     ## This regex checks if the email contains letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens before the @ symbol
     ## and also checks for a valid domain with at least 2 and at most 4 letters/numbers after the dot
    print "Valid email address";
} else {
    print "Invalid email address";
}
