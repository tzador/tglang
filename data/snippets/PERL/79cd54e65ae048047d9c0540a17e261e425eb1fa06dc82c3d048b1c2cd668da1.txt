#This is a code snippet in PERL
#It generates a Fibonacci sequence using a recursive function
sub fibonacci{ #creates a subroutine called "fibonacci"

    }
    else #if $n is greater than or equal to 2
    {
        return fibonacci($n - 1) + fibonacci($n - 2); #calls the fibonacci function recursively, adding the results
    }
}

for my $i (1..10) #creates a for loop that iterates from 1 to 10
{
    my $fib = fibonacci($i); #assigns the result of the fibonacci function with $i as the argument to $fib
    print "$fib "; #prints the result with a space in between each number
}

#output: 
`` `1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
