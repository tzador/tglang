# This is a brief description of the code snippet
# This code snippet takes in a list of numbers and performs various operations on it.

use strict;

# Input list of numbers
my @my_list = (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20);

# Calculate the average of the numbers

# Create a variable to store the sum of numbers
my $sum = 0;

# Loop through the list and add each number to the sum
foreach my $num (@my_list) {
  $sum += $num;
}

# Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list
my $average = $sum / scalar(@my_list);

# Print the average to the console
print "The average of the numbers is: $average\n";

# Find the largest number in the list

# Create a variable to store the largest number
my $largest_num = $my_list[0]; # Assume the first number in the list is the largest

# Loop through the list and compare each number to the stored largest number
foreach my $num (@my_list) {
  if ($num > $largest_num) {
    $largest_num = $num;
  }
}

# Print the largest number to the console
print "The largest number in the list is: $largest_num\n";

# Square each number in the list

# Create a new empty list to store squared numbers
my @squared_list = ();

# Loop through the list and square each number, then push it to the new list
foreach my $num (@my_list) {
  my $squared_num = $num ** 2;
  push(@squared_list, $squared_num);
}

# Print the squared list to the console
print "The squared list is: @squared_list\n";
