# This is a code snippet in Perl that creates a hash and performs various operations on it.

# Create a hash with key-value pairs
my %students = (
    "John" => 22,
    "Emma" => 20,
    "David" => 24,
    "Sara" => 19
);

# Print all the keys in the hash
print "All students: ";
print join(", ", keys(%students));
print "\n";

# Print the age of a specific student, in this case Sara
print "Sara's age: ";
print $students{"Sara"};
print "\n";

# Add a new student to the hash
$students{"Emily"} = 21;

# Update the age of a student
$students{"John"} = 23;

# Delete a student from the hash
delete $students{"David"};

# Print the new hash with modifications
print "Modified students: ";
print join(", ", keys(%students));
print "\n";

# Sort the students in alphabetical order
foreach my $name (sort keys %students) {
    print "$name\n";
}

# Output:
# All students: John, Emma, David, Sara
# Sara's age: 19
# Modified students: John, Emma, Sara, Emily
# Emily
# Emma
# John
# Sara
