# This code snippet is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations

# Declaring variables
my $num1 = 10;
my $num2 = 5;

# Addition
my $sum = $num1 + $num2;

# Subtraction
my $difference = $num1 - $num2;

# Multiplication
my $product = $num1 * $num2;

# Division
my $quotient = $num1 / $num2;

# Modulus
my $remainder = $num1 % $num2;

# Printing the results
print "The sum is: $sum\n";
print "The difference is: $difference\n";
print "The product is: $product\n";
print "The quotient is: $quotient\n";
print "The remainder is: $remainder\n";

# Output:
# The sum is: 15
# The difference is: 5
# The product is: 50
# The quotient is: 2
# The remainder is: 0
