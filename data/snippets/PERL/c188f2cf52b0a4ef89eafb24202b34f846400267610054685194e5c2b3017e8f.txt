# This code snippet generates a random sentence using basic string manipulation and loops

# Create an array of nouns, verbs, and adjectives
my @nouns = qw(bird cat dog tree monkey);
my @verbs = qw(flies jumps runs barks climbs);
my @adjectives = qw(small fluffy green loud tall);

# Initialize an empty string to store the generated sentence
my $sentence = "";

# Use a for loop to randomly pick a word from each array and concatenate them to form a sentence
for(my $i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    my $random_noun = $nouns[rand @nouns];
    my $random_verb = $verbs[rand @verbs];
    my $random_adjective = $adjectives[rand @adjectives];
    # Concatenate the words with a space in between
    $sentence .= "$random_adjective $random_noun $random_verb ";
}

# Remove the extra space at the end of the sentence
chop $sentence;

# Print the generated sentence
print $sentence;

# Output: loud cat barks green monkey climbs small tree jumps
