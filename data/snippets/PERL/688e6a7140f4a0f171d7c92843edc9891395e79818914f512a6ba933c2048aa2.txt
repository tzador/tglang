# Declare a string variable
my $string = "Hello World!";

# Declare an integer variable
my $number = 42;

# Print the contents of the string
print $string; # Output: Hello World!

# Add 1 to the number variable
$number += 1;

# Concatenate the string and number variables
my $new_string = $string . " " . $number; # Output: Hello World! 43

# Use a conditional statement to check if number is greater than 50
if ($number > 50) {
    print "The number is greater than 50.";
} else {

# Create a list (array) of numbers
my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

# Loop through the list and print each number
foreach my $num (@numbers) {

5

# Define a hash (associative array) of strings and their corresponding lengths

Hello has a length of 5
World has a length of 5
Programming has a length of 11
