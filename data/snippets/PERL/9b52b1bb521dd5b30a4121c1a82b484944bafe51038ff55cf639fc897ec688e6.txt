# This is a long and complex code snippet in PERL. It includes functions, variables, loops, and conditionals.
# First, a variable is declared and set to a string value.
my $string = "Hello, World!";

# Next, a function is created to print the value of the variable.
sub print_string {
    # The "shift" function is used to access the variable passed as an argument to the function.
    # It removes the first element of the argument array and returns it.
    my $string_arg = shift;

    # The "print" function displays the value of the passed argument.
    print $string_arg;
}

# A conditional statement is used to check if the length of the string is less than or equal to 10.
if (length $string <= 10) {
    # If the condition is true, the function is called, passing the string variable as an argument.
    print_string($string);
}

# A for loop is used to iterate through a range of numbers.
for (my $i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    # The "if" statement checks if the current value is divisible by 2.
    if ($i % 2 == 0) {
        # If the condition is true, the current value is printed.
        print $i;
    }
}

# Another function is created to perform a mathematical operation.
sub add_numbers {
    # The "return" keyword is used to return the result of the expression.
    return 5 + 10;
}

# The result of the function is assigned to a variable.
my $sum = add_numbers();

# The value of the variable is printed.
print $sum;
