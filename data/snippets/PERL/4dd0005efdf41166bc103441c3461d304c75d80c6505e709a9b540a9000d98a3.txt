# This is the first line of code in a subroutine.
# It takes in two parameters, $a and $b, and returns the sum of the two.
sub add {
    my ($a, $b) = @_;  # Assigns the values of $a and $b to the array '@_'

    my $sum = $a + $b;  # Calculates the sum of the two parameters
    return $sum;        # Returns the sum as the result of the subroutine
}

# This is the main program
# It calls the subroutine 'add' and passes in two numbers, 3 and 5, as arguments
my $result = add(3, 5);  # Assigns the returned value from 'add' to the variable '$result'

# Prints the result on the screen
print "The sum of 3 and 5 is: $result\n";
