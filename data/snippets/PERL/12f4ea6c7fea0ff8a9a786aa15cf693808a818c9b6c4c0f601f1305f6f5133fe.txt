# This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
# It uses recursion to solve the problem

# Creating a subroutine to calculate factorial
sub factorial{
    # Getting the number as parameter
    my ($number) = @_;

    # Base case - factorial of 0 is 1
    if($number == 0){
        return 1;
    }
    # Recursively calling the factorial function with number-1
    # and multiplying it with the number
    else{
        return $number * factorial($number-1);
    }
}

# Taking user input for the number
print "Enter a number to find its factorial: ";
chomp(my $input = <STDIN>);

# Calling the factorial subroutine and storing the result
my $result = factorial($input);

# Printing the result
print "$input! = $result";
