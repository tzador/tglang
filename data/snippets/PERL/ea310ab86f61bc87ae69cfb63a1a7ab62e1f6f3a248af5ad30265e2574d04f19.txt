## This code snippet uses the List::Util module to find the average of a list of numbers.

use List::Util qw(sum);

# Create an array of numbers
my @numbers = (5, 10, 15, 20, 25);

# Use the sum function from the List::Util module to add all the numbers together
my $total = sum(@numbers);

# Calculate the average by dividing the total by the length of the array
my $average = $total / scalar @numbers;

# Print out the average
print "The average of the numbers is $average";
