# This is a Perl script that prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
# Each number is calculated by adding the two previous numbers in the sequence

# Define the first two numbers in the sequence
my $first = 0;
my $second = 1;

# Print the first two numbers
print "$first\n";
print "$second\n";

# Loop to calculate and print the following 8 numbers in the sequence
for (my $i = 0; $i < 8; $i++) {

    # Calculate the next number in the sequence
    my $next = $first + $second;

    # Print the next number
    print "$next\n";

    # Update the first and second numbers for the next iteration
    $first = $second;
    $second = $next;
}

# Output:
