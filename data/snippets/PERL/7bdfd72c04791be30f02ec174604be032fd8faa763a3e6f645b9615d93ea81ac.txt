# This program uses nested loops to generate a multiplication table from 1 to 10
# Declaring variables
my $row; # variable for rows
my $column; # variable for columns

# Outer loop for rows
for ($row = 1; $row <= 10; $row++) {
    
    # Inner loop for columns
    for ($column = 1; $column <= 10; $column++) {
        
        # Printing the product of row and column
        print $row * $column, " ";
    }
    
    # Printing a new line after each row is complete
    print "\n";
