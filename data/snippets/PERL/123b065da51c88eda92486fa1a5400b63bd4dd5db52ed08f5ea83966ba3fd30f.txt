# Defining a function named "add" that takes in two parameters
sub add {
    my ($num1, $num2) = @_; # Storing the two parameters in variables
    my $result = $num1 + $num2; # Adding the two numbers and storing the result in a variable
    return $result; # Returning the result
}

# Setting variables
my $x = 10;
my $y = 5;

# Calling the "add" function and passing in the values of x and y as arguments
my $sum = add($x, $y);

# Printing the result 
print "The sum of $x and $y is $sum.";

# Output: The sum of 10 and 5 is 15.
