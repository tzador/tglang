# This code snippet uses a for loop to iterate through a range of numbers and prints out the sum of the numbers
my $sum = 0; # declaring a variable and assigning initial value of 0

# using a for loop to iterate through a range of numbers from 1 to 10
for(my $i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++){
    $sum += $i; # adding the value of each number to the sum variable
}

# printing out the sum of the numbers
print "The sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is: $sum\n";

# Output: The sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is: 55
