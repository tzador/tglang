##### This is a code snippet in PERL that generates a complex data structure #####
my %employee_info = (  # creating a hash (associative array) to store employee information
    "John" => {  # "John" is the key, and the value is another hash
        "age" => 35,
        "department" => "Marketing",
        "salary" => 150000
    },
    "Jane" => {
        "age" => 28,
        "department" => "Finance",
        "salary" => 120000
    },
    "Mike" => {
        "age" => 42,
        "department" => "Human Resources",
        "salary" => 180000
    }
);

# Printing out the data structure in a formatted way 
print "Employee Name\tAge\tDepartment\tSalary\n";  # headers for the table
foreach my $name (keys %employee_info){  # looping through the keys of the employee_info hash
    print $name, "\t\t";  # printing the employee's name with a tab
    foreach my $key (keys %{ $employee_info{$name} }) {  # looping through the keys in the inner hash for each employee
        print $employee_info{$name}{$key}, "\t";  # printing the value associated with each key with a tab
    }
    print "\n";  # printing a new line after each employee's information is printed
