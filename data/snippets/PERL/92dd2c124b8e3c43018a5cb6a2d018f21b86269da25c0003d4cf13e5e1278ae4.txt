###Define a subroutine to calculate the factorial of a number
sub factorial {
    my $num = shift; #take the number as an argument
    my $factorial = 1;
 
    #Loop through all the numbers from 1 to the given number
    for (my $i = 1; $i <= $num; $i++) {
        $factorial *= $i; #multiply the current factorial with the next number
    }
 
    return $factorial; #return the factorial value
}
 
###Get user input for the number to calculate the factorial of
print "Enter a number: ";
my $input = <STDIN>;
 
chomp $input; #remove the newline character from the input
 
my $result = factorial($input); #call the factorial subroutine
 
print "Factorial of $input is $result\n"; #print the result
