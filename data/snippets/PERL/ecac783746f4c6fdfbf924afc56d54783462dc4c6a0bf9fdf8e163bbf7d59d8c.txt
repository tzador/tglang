## This code snippet checks if a given number is a prime number

# Define a subroutine that checks if a number is prime
sub is_prime {
  my $num = shift; # Take the number as an argument and assign to variable
  my $flag = 1; # Initialize a flag variable
  for(my $i = 2; $i <= sqrt($num); $i++) { # Loop from 2 to square root of number
    if($num % $i == 0) { # Check if number is divisible by any number between 2 and its square root
      $flag = 0; # If yes, set flag to 0
      last; # Exit loop
    }
  }
  if($flag) { # If flag is still 1, number is prime
    print "$num is a prime number"; # Output result
  } else { # Otherwise, number is not prime
    print "$num is not a prime number"; # Output result
  }
}

# Call the subroutine and pass in a number
is_prime(17); # Output: 17 is a prime number

# Call the subroutine and pass in another number
is_prime(16); # Output: 16 is not a prime number
