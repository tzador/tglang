# This is a code snippet in Perl that creates a function to calculate the factorial of a number
sub calculate_factorial {
  my ($number) = @_; # creates a local variable called $number to store the argument passed into the function
  my $result = 1; # initiates a local variable to store the result
  for (my $i = 2; $i <= $number; $i++) { # loops through all numbers from 2 to the given number
    $result *= $i; # multiplies the current result by the current number
  }
  return $result; # returns the calculated factorial
}

# Example usage:
my $n = 5; # sets the number to calculate the factorial of
my $factorial = calculate_factorial($n); # calls the function and stores the result in a variable
print "The factorial of $n is $factorial\n"; # prints the result in a readable format

# Output:
