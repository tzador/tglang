# This program calculates the factorial of a given number

# initialize the number that we want to find the factorial of

# initialize the factorial variable to store the result

# loop through each number from 1 to the input number
for (my $i = 1; $i <= $number; $i++) {

    # multiply the factorial by the current number
    $factorial *= $i;

# print the result
