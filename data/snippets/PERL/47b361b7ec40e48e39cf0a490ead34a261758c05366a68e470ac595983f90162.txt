# This program calculates the factorial of a given number

    for (my $i = 1; $i <= $n; $i++) {
        # Multiply the current number with the accumulator
        $factorial *= $i;
    }
    
    # Return the final factorial value
    return $factorial;

# Get input from user
print "Enter a number: ";

# Call the factorial subroutine with the user input as argument
my $result = factorial($input);

# Print the output
