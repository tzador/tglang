# This is a code snippet in Perl

# Define a subroutine named "calculate"
sub calculate {
    # Function takes two parameters, x and y
    my ($x, $y) = @_;

    # Addition operation
    my $sum = $x + $y;

    # Subtraction operation
    my $difference = $x - $y;

    # Multiplication operation
    my $product = $x * $y;

    # Division operation
    my $quotient = $x / $y;

    # Modulus operation
    my $remainder = $x % $y;

    # Print the results of all operations with appropriate labels
    print "Sum: $sum\n";
    print "Difference: $difference\n";
    print "Product: $product\n";
    print "Quotient: $quotient\n";
    print "Remainder: $remainder\n";

# Call the calculate subroutine with arguments 10 and 3
calculate(10, 3);
