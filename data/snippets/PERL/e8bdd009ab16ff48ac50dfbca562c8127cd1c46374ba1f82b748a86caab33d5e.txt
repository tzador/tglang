#This is a simple code snippet in PERL that calculates the factorial of a given number
 
$num = 5; #setting the number whose factorial we want to calculate
$fact = 1; #initializing the factorial variable
 
#using for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to the given number
for($i = 1; $i <= $num; $i++){
    $fact = $fact * $i; #calculating the factorial by multiplying each number with the previous number
}
 
print "The factorial of $num is $fact"; #printing the result
