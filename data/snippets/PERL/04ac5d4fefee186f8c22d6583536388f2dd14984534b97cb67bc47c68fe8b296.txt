# This code snippet illustrates how to use regex in PERL
 
 # Defining a string to match against
 my $string = "Hello World";
 
 # Matching the string against a regex that checks for a word starting with 'H' and ending with 'd'
 if ($string =~ /^H.*d$/){
    print "The regex matched!\n";
 }
 else{
    print "The regex did not match!\n";
 }
 
 # Creating an array of string to use for multiple matches
 my @strings = ("HELLO", "World", "Goodbye", "happy");
 
 # Looping through the array and printing only the strings that start with 'H' and end with 'o'
 foreach my $str (@strings){
    if ($str =~ /^H.*o$/){
       print "The string $str matches the regex!\n";
    }
 }
 
 # Using regex to replace a specific pattern in a string
 my $replace_str = "I love cats and dogs";
 
 # Replacing 'cats' with 'tigers'
 $replace_str =~ s/cats/tigers/;
 print "The new string is $replace_str\n";
 
 # Using regex capture groups to extract specific portions of a string
 my $extract_str = "John Doe,26";
 
 # Extracting the name and age from the string using capture groups
 if($extract_str =~ /(.*),(.*)/){
    print "Name: $1, Age: $2\n";
 }
