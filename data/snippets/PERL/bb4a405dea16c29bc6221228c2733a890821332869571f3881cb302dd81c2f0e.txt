# This is a Perl program that reads a list of numbers as command line arguments
# and displays the square root of each number

# Declare an array to store the command line arguments
my @numbers;

# Use a loop to iterate through each command line argument and add it to the array
foreach $arg (@ARGV) {
    push @numbers, $arg;
}

# Use the sqrt function to calculate the square root of each number in the array
foreach $num (@numbers) {
    my $square_root = sqrt($num);
    # Print the square root with two decimal places
    printf("%.2f\n", $square_root);
}
