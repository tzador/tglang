# This is a Perl program that generates a list of prime numbers
# from 2 to n
# Input: integer n
# Output: list of prime numbers between 2 and n

# Take input from user
chomp(my $n = <STDIN>);

# Loop from 2 to n

    # Initialize a boolean variable to track if a number is prime
    my $is_prime = 1;

    # Check if current number is divisible by numbers less than it
    foreach my $j (2 .. $i-1) {

        # If current number is divisible by another number, set is_prime to false and break out of the loop
        if ($i % $j == 0) {
            $is_prime = 0;
