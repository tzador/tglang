# This is a complex code snippet in PERL
# It will generate a random string from a given character set
# First, we define our character set using an array
my @char_set = ('a'..'z', 'A'..'Z', '0'..'9');

# Next, we prompt the user for the desired length of the string
print "Enter the desired length of the string: ";

# Then, we read the user's input and store it in a variable
my $length = <STDIN>;

# We need to remove the newline character from the end of the user's input
chomp $length;

# Now, we use a for loop to generate a string of the desired length
# We will concatenate random characters from our character set to this string
my $string = '';
for (my $i = 0; $i < $length; $i++){
  # We use the rand function to generate a random index from our character set
  # In PERL, the rand function returns a random fractional number between 0 and the given value
 my $index = int(rand(@char_set));

  # Then, we use the index to access a random character from our character set
 my $char = $char_set[$index];

  # We concatenate this character to our string
 $string .= $char;
}

# Finally, we print the generated string
print "The random string is: $string\n";
