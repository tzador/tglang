##This code snippet uses the open() function in Perl to open and read a file
open(my $FILE, '<', 'input.txt') or die "Could not open file: $!";
 
my @lines = <$FILE>; #stores each line in the file as an element in an array
close($FILE);

foreach my $line (@lines) { #loops through each element in the array
    chomp($line); #removes newline character from end of each line
    my @words = split(" ", $line); #splits the line into an array of words
    foreach my $word (@words) { #loops through each word in the line
        print uc($word) . " "; #capitalizes the word and adds a space to the end
    }
    print "\n"; #prints a new line after each line is processed
}
