This is a code snippet demonstrating a complex function in PERL.
It takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean.
=cut

#Define the function, using a subroutine
sub mean {
    #Get the input list
    my @numbers = @_;

    #Calculate the sum of all the numbers
    my $sum = 0;
    foreach my $num (@numbers) {
        $sum += $num;
    }

    #Calculate the length of the list
    my $size = scalar(@numbers);

    #Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the length
    my $mean = $sum / $size;

    #Return the mean
    return $mean;
}

#Example usage
my @list = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9);
my $result = mean(@list);
print "The mean of the list is $result\n";
