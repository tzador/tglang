# This code snippet uses Perl's pattern matching and arrays to check if a sentence contains a certain word
# First, we create an array with some sample sentences
my @sentences = ("Hello, my name is John.", "I am a programmer.", "Today is a beautiful day.");

# Next, we define the word we want to check for
my $word = "programmer";

# Then, we loop through each sentence in the array
foreach (@sentences) {

    # We use the pattern matching operator to check if the word is present
    if ($_ =~ /$word/) {

        # If the word is present, we print out the sentence and a message saying the word was found
        print "$_\nThis sentence contains the word '$word'.\n";

    } else {

        # If the word is not present, we print out the sentence and a message saying the word was not found
        print "$_\nThis sentence does not contain the word '$word'.\n";
    }
}

# Output:
# Hello, my name is John.
# This sentence does not contain the word 'programmer'.
# I am a programmer.
# This sentence contains the word 'programmer'.
# Today is a beautiful day.
# This sentence does not contain the word 'programmer'.
