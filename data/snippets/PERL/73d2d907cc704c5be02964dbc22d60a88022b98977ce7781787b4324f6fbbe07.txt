# This code snippet uses Regular Expressions in PERL to extract information from a text file.

my $filename = 'text_file.txt';

# Open the file for reading
open(my $fh, '<', $filename) or die "Could not open file '$filename' $!";

# Initialize an empty array to store results
my @results;

# Use a while loop to iterate through each line in the file
while (my $line = <$fh>) {

  # Use regular expression to capture string between "start" and "end" tags
  if ($line =~ /start(.*?)end/g) {
  
    # Save the captured string to a variable
    my $result = $1;
    
    # Push the result into the array
    push @results, $result;
  }
}

# Print out the results
print "@results\n";

# Close the file handle
close $fh;

# The output of the code should be the extracted strings between "start" and "end" tags in the text file.
