# This code snippet uses the Perl language to calculate the factorial of a given number

# Define a function to calculate the factorial
sub factorial {
  my $number = $_[0]; # get the number from the input argument
  my $result = 1; # initialize the result to 1
  for (my $i = $number; $i >= 1; $i--) { # loop through numbers from input down to 1
    $result *= $i; # multiply current result by current number
  }
  return $result; # return the final result
}

# Get input from the user
print "Enter a number: ";
chomp(my $num = <STDIN>);

# Call the factorial function and store the result
my $factorial = factorial($num);

# Print the result
print "The factorial of $num is $factorial";
