# This code snippet calculates pi using the Leibniz formula
use Math::Trig qw( pi ); # Import pi constant from Math::Trig module

my $iterations = 100000; # Number of iterations for more accurate result
my $sum = 0; # Initialize sum variable
for (my $i = 0; $i < $iterations; $i++) { # Loop through each iteration
    my $term = (-1)**$i / (2*$i + 1); # Calculate the term using the Leibniz formula
    $sum += $term; # Add the term to the sum
}
my $pi = 4 * $sum; # Multiply sum by 4 to get an approximation of pi
print "The calculated value of pi is: $pi"; # Print the calculated value of pi
