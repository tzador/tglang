# This code snippet uses regular expressions to extract information from a string

# Declare a string variable
my $string = "Hello there, my name is John and I am 25 years old.";

# Use regular expression to extract name
$string =~ /Hello there, my name is ([\w]+)/;
my $name = $1; # Assigns captured group to variable

# Use regular expression to extract age
$string =~ /(\d+) years old/;
my $age = $1; # Assigns captured group to variable

# Print extracted information
print "Name: $name\n";
print "Age: $age\n";
