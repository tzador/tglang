# This is a code snippet in PERL

# Define a subroutine to calculate the factorial of a number
sub factorial {
    my $num = $_[0];    # Take input number
    if ($num == 1) {
        return 1;       # Base case for factorial
    } else {
        return $num * factorial($num - 1);    # Recursively call the function
    }
}

# Main logic
print "Enter a number: ";    # Print prompt for user
my $number = <STDIN>;        # Take input from user
chomp($number);              # Remove trailing newline
my $factorial = factorial($number);    # Calculate factorial
print "The factorial of $number is $factorial\n";   # Print result
