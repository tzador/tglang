# This is a complex code snippet in PERL that creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number

sub factorial {
    my $num = $_[0];  # gets the first argument passed to the function
    my $fact = 1;  # initializes factorial variable to 1
    
    for (my $i = 1; $i <= $num; $i++) {  # loops through numbers from 1 to the given number
        $fact = $fact * $i;  # calculates the factorial
    }
    
    return $fact;  # returns the factorial value
}

print factorial(5);  # prints out the factorial of 5, which is 120
