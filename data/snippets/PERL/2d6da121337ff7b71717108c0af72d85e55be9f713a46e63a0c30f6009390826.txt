### This code snippet demonstrates the use of regular expressions in PERL to extract data from a text file 

# Import the necessary modules
use strict;
use warnings;
use File::Slurp;

# Define a variable to store the file name
my $file_name = "sample_text_file.txt";

# Read the contents of the file
my $file_contents = read_file($file_name);

# Use regular expressions to extract the data from the file
my $regex = qr/(\d+)\s+(\w+)\s+([A-Z]{2})/;

# Create an empty array to store the extracted data
my @extracted_data;

# Loop through each line of the file contents
foreach my $line (split /\n/, $file_contents) {
    # If the line matches the regular expression
    if ($line =~ $regex) {
        # Extract the data and store it in the array
        my $id = $1;
        my $name = $2;
        my $country = $3;
        push(@extracted_data, [$id, $name, $country]);
    }
}

# Print the extracted data in a tabular format
foreach my $row (@extracted_data) {
    print(join("\t", @{$row}) . "\n");
}

# Output:
# 1      John    US
# 2      Mary    CA
# 3      David   UK
# 4      Sarah   AU
