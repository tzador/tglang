# This is a complex code snippet in PERL that generates a mathematical sequence
# This program takes in a number from the user and outputs the sequence

# Prompting user for input
print "Enter a number: ";

# Getting input from user and storing it in a variable
my $number = <STDIN>;

# Initializing variables for sequence
my $current = 1; # starting number of sequence
my $next = 1; # holds the next number in the sequence
my $temp; # temporarily holds the current number to calculate the next number

# Creating an array to store the sequence
my @sequence = ();

# Looping until the number of elements in the sequence is equal to the user input
while (scalar @sequence < $number) {

    # Calculating the next number in the sequence
    $temp = $current + $next;
    # Storing the current number in the sequence array
    push @sequence, $current;
    # Assigning the next number to the current number for the next iteration
    $current = $next;
    # Assigning the calculated number to the next number for the next iteration
    $next = $temp;
}

# Printing the sequence in a formatted way
# First, creating a string to hold the sequence numbers
my $sequence_string = join(', ', @sequence);
# Then, printing the sequence with appropriate labels
print "The first $number numbers in the sequence are: $sequence_string.\n";
