# This code snippet is in PERL and
# it generates a random sequence of DNA bases
#

# Import the necessary modules
use strict;
# Use the random number generator function from the
# Perl core library
use rand;

# Define a subroutine to generate a random sequence
# of DNA bases
sub generate_dna_sequence {

    # Define a string variable to store our sequence
    my $sequence;

    # Define a list of possible DNA bases
    my @bases = ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T');

    # Using a for loop, generate a sequence of 10 bases
    # and concatenate them onto the $sequence variable
    for (my $i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {

        # Use the rand function to generate a random
        # number between 0 and 3
        my $random_num = int(rand(4));

        # Use the random number as an index to access
        # a random base from the @bases list
        my $base = $bases[$random_num];

        # Concatenate the chosen base onto the sequence
        $sequence .= $base;
    }

    # Return the generated sequence
    return $sequence;
}

# Call the subroutine and store the returned sequence
# in a variable
my $random_sequence = generate_dna_sequence();

# Print the generated sequence
print "Random DNA sequence: $random_sequence\n";
