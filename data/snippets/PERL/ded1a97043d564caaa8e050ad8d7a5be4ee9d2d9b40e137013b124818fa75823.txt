my $str = "Hello world!"; # This creates a string variable called $str and assigns the value "Hello world!" to it

print "The original string is: $str\n"; # This prints out the original string with a line break at the end

$str =~ s/world/there/; # This uses the substitute operator (s/ / /) to replace the word "world" with "there" in $str

# Output:
# The original string is: Hello world!
# The modified string is: Hello there!
