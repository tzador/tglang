# This code snippet uses a for loop to print the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
# Each number is printed on a new line and the program ends once the 20th number is printed

my $first = 0; # initialize the first number in the sequence
my $second = 1; # initialize the second number in the sequence

# use a for loop to iterate 20 times
for (my $i = 0; $i < 20; $i++) {
    print "$first\n"; # print the current number in the sequence
    
    my $temp = $first + $second; # calculate the next number in the sequence
    $first = $second; # switch the first number with the second number
    $second = $temp; # replace the second number with the next number
}

# Output:
# 0
# 1
