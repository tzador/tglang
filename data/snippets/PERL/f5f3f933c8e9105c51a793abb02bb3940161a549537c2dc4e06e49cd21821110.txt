### This program prints out the sum of the squares of the first 10 natural numbers

# Declare a variable to hold the sum
my $sum = 0;

# Use a FOR loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 10
for (my $i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {

    # Calculate the square of the current number
    my $square = $i * $i;

    # Add the square to the current sum
    $sum += $square;
}

# Print out the result
print "Sum of squares of first 10 natural numbers: $sum \n";

### Output:
### Sum of squares of first 10 natural numbers: 385
