##We are declaring three variables with different data types, namely, a string, an integer, and an array
my $name = "John";
my $age = 25;
my @courses = ("Math", "Science", "English");

##We are using a for loop to iterate through the array and print out each element with its index number
print "My name is $name and I am $age years old.\nHere are the courses I am taking:\n";
for my $i (0 .. $#courses) {
    print "$i. $courses[$i]\n";
}

##We are using an if statement to check if the age variable is less than or equal to 18
##If it is, we print out a message saying the person is a minor
##If not, we print out a message saying the person is an adult
if ($age <= 18) {
    print "I am a minor.\n";
} else {
    print "I am an adult.\n";
}

##We are creating a sub routine that takes in two numbers as parameters and returns their sum
sub add_nums {
    my ($num1, $num2) = @_;
    my $sum = $num1 + $num2;
    return $sum;
}

##We are calling the sub routine and passing in two numbers, 10 and 20
##We then print out the result which should be 30
my $result = add_nums(10, 20);
print "The sum of 10 and 20 is $result.\n";
