# This code snippet is a simple Perl script that finds the average of a list of numbers
# Define an array of numbers to be used for calculation
my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

# Declare and initialize variables to store total and count
my $total = 0;
my $count = scalar(@numbers);

# Loop through the array and add each number to the total
foreach my $num (@numbers) {
    $total += $num;
}

# Calculate the average by dividing the total by the count
my $average = $total / $count;

# Print the average with two decimal places
printf("The average of the numbers is: %.2f", $average);

# Output:
# The average of the numbers is: 3.50
