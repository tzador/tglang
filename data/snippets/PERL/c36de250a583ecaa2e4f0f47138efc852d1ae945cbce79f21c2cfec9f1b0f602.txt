# This is a simple code snippet in PERL that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

# Initialize sub routine to calculate factorial
sub factorial {
    my $n = shift; # assign input to variable n

    # check for base case (when n is 0)
    if ($n == 0) { 
        return 1; # return 1 if n is 0
    }
    else {
        return $n * factorial($n - 1); # recursively call factorial sub routine with n-1
    }
}

# Take input from user
print "Enter a number to calculate factorial: ";
my $num = <STDIN>;

# Remove new line character from input
chomp $num;

# Calculate factorial using factorial sub routine
my $result = factorial($num);

# Print result
print "Factorial of $num is $result";
