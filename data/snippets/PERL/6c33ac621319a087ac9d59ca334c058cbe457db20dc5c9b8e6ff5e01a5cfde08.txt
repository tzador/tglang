# This code snippet uses a for loop to perform a search for a specific substring in a given string

my $string = "This is a string with multiple words";
my $substring = "multiple";

for (my $i = 0; $i < length($string); $i++) {
    my $slice = substr($string, $i, length($substring));
    if ($slice eq $substring) {
        # print the index where the substring was found
        print "The substring was found at index $i\n";
    }
}

# Output:
# The substring was found at index 17

# Explanation: This code uses the built-in function `substr` to create a slice of the original string starting at index `i` and with a length equal to the length of the substring we are searching for. Then, the `if` statement compares the slice with the substring, and if they are equal, the index `i` is printed as the location where the substring was found. This process continues until the for loop reaches the end of the original string.
