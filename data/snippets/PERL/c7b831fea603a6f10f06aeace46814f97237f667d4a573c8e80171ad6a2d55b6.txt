#This is a code snippet written in PERL
#It contains a function called calculate_sum that takes in two parameters

#Function to calculate the sum of two numbers

    }
    
    #Calculates the sum and assigns it to a variable
    my $sum = $num1 + $num2;

    #Returns the result

#Takes in user input for the two numbers

#Calls the function and assigns the return value to a variable
my $result = calculate_sum($number1, $number2);

#Prints out the result
