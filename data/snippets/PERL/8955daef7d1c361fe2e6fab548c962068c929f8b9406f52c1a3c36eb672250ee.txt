# This is a simple code snippet that generates a random DNA sequence.
# The DNA sequence is 100 bases long and consists of only A, T, C, and G nucleotides.

# Importing the necessary module
use strict;
use warnings;
use Data::Random qw(:all);

# Defining the length of the DNA sequence
my $seq_length = 100;

# Creating an array of nucleotides
my @nucleotides = ('A', 'T', 'C', 'G');

# Generating a random DNA sequence
my $random_seq = join '', map { $nucleotides[rand @nucleotides] } 1..$seq_length;

# Printing the DNA sequence
print "Random DNA sequence of length $seq_length: \n$random_seq\n";
