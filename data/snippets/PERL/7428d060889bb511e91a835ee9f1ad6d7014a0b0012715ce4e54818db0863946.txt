# This code snippet uses the Perl programming language to sort a given array 
## Array of integers
my @numbers = (23, 10, 4, 56, 33, 2, 9); 

## Loop through array to find lowest number
foreach my $num (@numbers) {
    my $lowest = $num; # Initialize lowest variable to the first number in array
    foreach my $nextNum (@numbers) {
        if ($nextNum < $lowest) { # Check if next number is lower than current lowest
            $lowest = $nextNum; # Update lowest number if next number is lower
        }
    }
    print $lowest, " "; # Print lowest number found in current iteration of loop
    @numbers = grep {$_ != $lowest} @numbers; # Remove lowest number from array for next iteration
