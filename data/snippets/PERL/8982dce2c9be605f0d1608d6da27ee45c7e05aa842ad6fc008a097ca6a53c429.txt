# This code snippet creates a hash table that stores information 
# about students in a given class
# The hash table has the student's name as the key and an array of
# their grades as the value
my %class_records = (
  "John" => [90, 85, 95],
  "Jane" => [80, 95, 98],
  "Bob" => [70, 75, 81],
);

# To add a new student, simply add a new key-value pair to the hash table
# with the student's name as the key and an empty array as the value
# For example, to add a new student named "Emily", the code would be:
$class_records{"Emily"} = [];

# To add a grade to a particular student's record, first access the 
# student's array of grades by using their name as the key and then
# use the push method to add the grade to the end of the array
# For example, to add a grade of 87 to John's record, the code would be:
push @{$class_records{"John"}}, 87;

# To print out all the students' names and their grades, we can use a 
# foreach loop to iterate through each key-value pair in the hash table
# For each iteration, we print the key (student's name) and then use the join
# function to join the array of grades together with a comma
foreach my $student (keys %class_records) {
  print "$student: " . join(", ", @{$class_records{$student}}) . "\n";
}

# The output would look something like this:
# John: 90, 85, 95
# Jane: 80, 95, 98
# Bob: 70, 75, 81
# Emily: 
# (Note that Emily's grades are empty since we haven't added any yet)
