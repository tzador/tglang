# This is a Perl program that calculates the area of a triangle using the Heron's formula

# Define variables for the three sides of the triangle
my $side1 = 10;
my $side2 = 16;
my $side3 = 13;

# Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle
my $s = ($side1 + $side2 + $side3) / 2;

# Calculate the area using Heron's formula
my $area = sqrt($s * ($s - $side1) * ($s - $side2) * ($s - $side3));

# Print the result in a formatted string
print "The area of the triangle with sides $side1, $side2, and $side3 is: $area\n"; 

# Output:
# The area of the triangle with sides 10, 16, and 13 is: 61.875
