# This is a code snippet in PERL

# Define a sub-routine called "factorial" that takes in one argument, "num"
sub factorial {
    my $num = shift;
    
    # Declare a variable "result" and initialize it to 1
    my $result = 1;
    
    # Loop through numbers from 1 to "num"
    for(my $i=1; $i<=$num; $i++) {
        # Multiply "result" by current value of "i"
        $result *= $i;
    }
    
    # Return the final value of "result"
    return $result;
}

# Declare a variable "input" and assign it a number
my $input = 5;

# Call the "factorial" sub-routine with "input" as argument and store the returned value in "output"
my $output = factorial($input);

# Print out the final result
print "The factorial of $input is $output\n";

# Output:
# The factorial of 5 is 120
