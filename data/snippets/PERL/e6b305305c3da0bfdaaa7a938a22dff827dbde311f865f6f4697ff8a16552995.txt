## This code snippet generates a Fibonacci sequence up to n numbers

## Declare a sub-routine for finding the Fibonacci sequence
sub fib {
    my $num = $_[0]; # Get input parameter for number of sequence
    my @seq = (1, 1); # Initialize array with first two terms of sequence
    for (my $i = 2; $i < $num; $i++) { # Loop through remaining numbers
        $seq[$i] = $seq[$i-1] + $seq[$i-2]; # Calculate next term in sequence
    }
    return \@seq; # Return reference to array containing sequence
}

## Get input from user for number of sequence
print "Enter the number of terms you want in the Fibonacci sequence: ";
my $n = <STDIN>; # Store user input in variable $n

## Generate Fibonacci sequence using sub-routine and store in array reference
my $fib_seq = fib($n); 

## Print out the Fibonacci sequence
print "The Fibonacci sequence up to $n terms is:\n";
foreach my $term (@$fib_seq) { # Loop through array reference
    print "$term "; # Print each term in sequence
}
