# This program takes in two numbers from the user and calculates their sum

# Prompt user to enter first number
print "Enter first number: ";

# Store user input in a variable
my $number1 = <STDIN>;

# Remove newline character from input
chomp($number1);

# Prompt user to enter second number
print "Enter second number: ";

# Store second input in a variable
my $number2 = <STDIN>;

# Remove newline character from input
chomp($number2);

# Calculate sum
my $sum = $number1 + $number2;

# Print result
print "The sum of $number1 and $number2 is $sum\n";
