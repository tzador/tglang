# This is a code snippet in PERL that generates a simple calculator
# It takes in two numbers and allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations on them

# Define variables for user input and operation
my $num1;
my $num2;
my $operation;

# Get user input
print "Please enter the first number: ";
$num1 = <STDIN>;
chomp $num1; # Remove new line character

print "Please enter the second number: ";
$num2 = <STDIN>;
chomp $num2; # Remove new line character

# Prompt user for operation
print "Please choose an operation (+, -, *, /): ";
$operation = <STDIN>;
chomp $operation; # Remove new line character

# Calculate and print result
