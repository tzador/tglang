### This code snippet calculates the average of an array of numbers
my @numbers = (23,54,67,91,32,76,12); # declaring an array of numbers

my $sum = 0; # initialize the sum variable to 0

foreach my $num (@numbers) { # looping through each number in the array
    $sum += $num; # adding the number to the sum variable
}

my $avg = $sum / scalar(@numbers); # calculating the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array

print "The average of the numbers is $avg"; # printing the average to the console
