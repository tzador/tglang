# This code snippet checks if a number is a prime number

# Define subroutine to check if a number is prime
sub is_prime {

    # Get input from user
    my $num = $_[0];

    # Define a variable to keep track of how many factors the number has
    my $factor_count = 0;

    # Loop through numbers from 2 up to the input number
    for (my $i = 2; $i <= $num; $i++) {

        # Check if input number is divisible by current number in loop
        if ($num % $i == 0) {

            # Increase factor count if divisible
            $factor_count += 1;
        }
    }

    # If the number has more than 2 factors, it is not prime
    if ($factor_count > 2) {

        # Print result
        print "$num is not a prime number\n";

    # Otherwise, it is prime
    } else {

        # Print result
        print "$num is a prime number\n";
    }
}

# Call the subroutine and pass in a number to check
is_prime(17);

# Output:
# 17 is a prime number
