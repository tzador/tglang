# This is a code snippet in PERL
# It will calculate the factorial of a number

    my $num = shift; # assigns the number to a variable
    my $result = 1; # initial value of result

    for my $i (1..$num) { # loop from 1 to the number
        $result *= $i; # multiply result by each number
    }

    return $result; # returns the factorial value
}

print factorial(5); # prints the factorial of 5 (120)
