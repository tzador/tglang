# This code snippet creates a function that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number
sub factorial {

    # get the parameter passed to the function
    my $num = shift;

    # base case: if the number is 0 or 1, return 1
    if ($num == 0 || $num == 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    # recursive case: call the function with the number decremented by 1
    # and multiply it with the current number
    return $num * factorial($num - 1);
}

# call the function with a number as the argument
my $result = factorial(5);

# print the result to the console
print "The factorial of 5 is $result\n";

# Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
