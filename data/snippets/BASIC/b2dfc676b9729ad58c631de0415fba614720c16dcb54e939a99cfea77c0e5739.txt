' This program calculates the average of three numbers
' Declare variables to store the three numbers and the average
dim num1, num2, num3, avg as float
' Get input from user for the three numbers
input "Enter the first number: ", num1
input "Enter the second number: ", num2
input "Enter the third number: ", num3
' Calculate the average by adding the three numbers and dividing by 3
avg = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3
' Output the result to the user
print "The average of the three numbers is "; avg
' If the average is greater than 10, display a message
if avg > 10 then
    print "The average is greater than 10!"
end if
' If the average is between 5 and 10, display a different message
if avg >= 5 and avg <= 10 then
    print "The average is between 5 and 10!"
end if
' If the average is less than 5, display a third message
if avg < 5 then
    print "The average is less than 5!"
end if
