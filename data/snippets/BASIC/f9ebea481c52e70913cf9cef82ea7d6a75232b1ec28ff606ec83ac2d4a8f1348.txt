' This is a long and complex code snippet in BASIC
' It generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

' Define variables
DIM nums(100) ' Create an array to store the sequence
a = 0 ' First number in the sequence
b = 1 ' Second number in the sequence
n = 0 ' Counter variable
max = 100 ' Maximum number in the sequence

' Loop to generate the sequence
FOR i = 1 TO max

    ' Add the previous two numbers in the sequence and store in the array
    nums(i) = a + b

    ' Update the previous numbers
    a = b
    b = nums(i)

    ' Print the current number in the sequence
    PRINT nums(i);

    ' Increment the counter
    n = n + 1

    ' Check if the sequence has reached the maximum number
    IF nums(i) >= max THEN
        EXIT FOR ' Exit the loop
    END IF

NEXT i ' Move on to the next iteration of the loop

' Print the final count of numbers in the sequence
PRINT "Total numbers in sequence: " + n;

' END OF CODE
