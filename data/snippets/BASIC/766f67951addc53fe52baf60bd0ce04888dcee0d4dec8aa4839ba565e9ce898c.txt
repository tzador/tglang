REM Fibonacci sequence program
INPUT "How many terms do you want to display? "; num

REM Declaration of variables
VAR a, b, c, i

REM Initial values
a = 0
b = 1
c = 0

REM Loop to generate Fibonacci sequence
FOR i = 1 TO num STEP 1
    PRINT c
    a = b
    b = c
    c = a + b
NEXT i

REM Output the nth term of the sequence
PRINT "The nth term is: ", c
