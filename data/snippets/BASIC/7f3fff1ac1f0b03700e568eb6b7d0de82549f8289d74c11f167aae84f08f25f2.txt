`This is a complex code snippet demonstrating basic operations in BASIC`

REM Declare variables to be used in the program
DIM a, b, c AS INTEGER
DIM x, y, z AS SINGLE

REM Assign values to variables
a = 5
b = 12
c = a + b

REM Print the result
PRINT c

REM Assign values to floating point variables
x = 3.14
y = 2.5
z = x * y

REM Print the result
PRINT z

REM Use conditional statements and loops
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    IF i <= 5 THEN
        PRINT "This number is less than or equal to 5"
    ELSE
        PRINT "This number is greater than 5"
    END IF
NEXT i

REM Use string manipulation functions
DIM str1 AS STRING
DIM str2 AS STRING
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
PRINT str1 + " " + str2

REM Use arrays and manipulate its elements
DIM nums(5) AS INTEGER
nums(0) = 5
nums(1) = 7
nums(2) = 10
nums(3) = 3
nums(4) = 9
PRINT "The sum of the first 5 elements in the array is: " + STR$(nums(0) + nums(1) + nums(2) + nums(3) + nums(4))

REM Define and call subroutines
SUB increaseNumber(num)
    num = num + 2
    PRINT "The number has been increased by 2: " + STR$(num)
END SUB

REM Call the subroutine
DIM num AS INTEGER
num = 10
CALL increaseNumber(num)

REM Define and call functions
FUNCTION calculateArea(radius)
    area = 3.14 * radius * radius
    calculateArea = area
END FUNCTION

REM Call the function
DIM radius AS SINGLE
radius = 5.5
area = calculateArea(radius)
PRINT "The area of the circle with radius " + STR$(radius) + " is " + STR$(area) + " square units."
