' This program calculates the sum and average of a list of numbers.

' Declare variables 
DIM numbers$(10)
DIM sum AS DOUBLE
DIM average AS DOUBLE
DIM i AS INTEGER

' Ask user to input up to 10 numbers 
PRINT "Enter up to 10 numbers:"

' Use FOR loop to store numbers in array 
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    INPUT numbers$(i)
NEXT i

' Use FOR EACH loop to loop through array and calculate sum 
FOR EACH number$ IN numbers$()
    sum = sum + VAL(number$)
NEXT number$

' Calculate average 
average = sum / 10

' Print results 
PRINT "Sum: " + STR$(sum)
PRINT "Average: " + STR$(average)
