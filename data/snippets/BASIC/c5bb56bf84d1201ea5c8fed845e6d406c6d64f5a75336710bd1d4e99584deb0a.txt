(Disclaimer: BASIC is a very simple and easy-to-learn programming language, so the following code snippet may not be as complex as other languages.)

' This is a comment in BASIC

' The following code demonstrates a simple program that calculates and displays the factorial of a number

INPUT "Enter a number:", num$

IF num$ > 0 THEN
LET factorial = 1

' A FOR loop is used to iterate from 1 to the input number
FOR counter = 1 TO num$
LET factorial = factorial * counter
NEXT counter

' Display the result
PRINT "The factorial of " + num$ + " is " + factorial
ELSE
PRINT "Invalid input."
END IF
