REM This program calculates the square root of a given number

    PRINT "Error: Cannot find square root of a negative number"
    END
ELSE

    FOR I = 0 TO 10 STEP 1

        IF SQUARE = N THEN
            PRINT "The square root of "; N; " is "; GUESS
            END
        END IF
        GUESS = (GUESS + (N / GUESS)) / 2
    NEXT I
PRINT "Could not find an accurate square root after 10 iterations"
