' This code snippet calculates the perimeter of a rectangle

' Define variables for length and width
DIM length AS INTEGER
DIM width AS INTEGER

' Prompt user to enter length of rectangle
INPUT "Enter the length of the rectangle: ", length
' Prompt user to enter width of rectangle
INPUT "Enter the width of the rectangle: ", width

' Calculate perimeter using formula p = 2(length + width)
DIM perimeter AS INTEGER
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

' Output the calculated perimeter
PRINT "The perimeter of the rectangle is: "; perimeter
