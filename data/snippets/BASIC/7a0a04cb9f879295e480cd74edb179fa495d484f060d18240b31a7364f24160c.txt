REM This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

REM Set initial values for first and second numbers
LET FIRST = 0
LET SECOND = 1

REM Ask user for the maximum number 
INPUT "Enter the maximum number for the sequence: ", MAX_NUM

REM Print the initial values
PRINT "Fibonacci Sequence:"
PRINT FIRST
PRINT SECOND

REM Perform loop to calculate next numbers in sequence
FOR I = 3 TO MAX_NUM
    LET NEXT = FIRST + SECOND
    PRINT NEXT
    LET FIRST = SECOND
    LET SECOND = NEXT
END FOR

REM End program
