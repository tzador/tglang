' Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit
' The input for the limit is stored in the variable "limit" and should be an integer
' The sequence will be stored in an array "fibseq"
' Initialize the array with the first two values of the sequence, 0 and 1
fibseq(0) = 0
fibseq(1) = 1
' Loop through the remaining indices of the array and calculate the Fibonacci value for each index
for i = 2 to limit
    fibseq(i) = fibseq(i-1) + fibseq(i-2)
next i
' Print out the Fibonacci sequence
for i = 0 to limit
    print fibseq(i)
next i
