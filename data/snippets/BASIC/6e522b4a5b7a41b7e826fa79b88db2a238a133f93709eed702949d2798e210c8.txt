` This BASIC code snippet is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number
` The 'number' variable is the input for which the factorial will be calculated
` The 'factorial' variable is used to store the result of the calculation
 
` Recursive function to calculate factorial
DEF FACT (number)
    ` Initialize factorial result with value of 1
    factorial = 1
 
    ` Check if number is 0 or 1, in which case factorial is 1
    IF number = 0 OR number = 1 THEN
        factorial = 1
    ELSE
        ` Recursive call to itself, decrementing the value of number on each call
        factorial = number * FACT(number - 1)
    END IF
 
    ` Return the calculated factorial value
    RETURN factorial
END DEF
 
` Call the recursive function FACT with input value of 5
PRINT "Factorial of 5 is: " + STR$(FACT(5))
