REM**BASIC CODE FOR CALCULATING DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS**

INPUT "ENTER THE X COORDINATE OF THE FIRST POINT: ", x1
INPUT "ENTER THE Y COORDINATE OF THE FIRST POINT: ", y1
INPUT "ENTER THE X COORDINATE OF THE SECOND POINT: ", x2
INPUT "ENTER THE Y COORDINATE OF THE SECOND POINT: ", y2

REM**CALCULATE THE DIFFERENCES IN THE X AND Y COORDINATES**
dx = x2 - x1
dy = y2 - y1

REM**CALCULATE THE SQUARES OF THE DIFFERENCES IN COORDINATES**
dx2 = dx * dx
dy2 = dy * dy

REM**ADD THE SQUARES TOGETHER TO GET THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE**
distance = dx2 + dy2

REM**CALCULATE THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE SUM TO GET THE ACTUAL DISTANCE**
actual_distance = SQRT(distance)

REM**PRINT THE RESULT TO THE SCREEN**
PRINT "THE DISTANCE BETWEEN POINT 1 AND POINT 2 IS: "; actual_distance
