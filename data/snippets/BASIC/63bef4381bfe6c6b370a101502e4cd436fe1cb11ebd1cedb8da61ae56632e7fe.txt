' User inputs the radius
INPUT "Enter the radius of the circle:", radius
DIM pi AS DOUBLE ' Define variable for pi
pi = 3.14159 ' Assign value to pi
DIM area AS DOUBLE ' Define variable for area
area = pi * radius ^ 2 ' Calculate area using formula
PRINT "The area of the circle with radius" radius "is" area
END ' End the program
