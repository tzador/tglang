REM The following code recursively calculates the factorial of a given number

DEF FN FACTORIAL(n)  'The factorial function takes in a number and returns its factorial
    IF n = 0 THEN     'If the number is 0, return 1 (base case)
        FACTORIAL = 1
    ELSE              'Otherwise, recursively call the function with n-1 and multiply it by n
        FACTORIAL = FN FACTORIAL(n-1) * n
    END IF
END DEF

REM Example usage:
PRINT "Factorial of 5 is: " + STR$(FN FACTORIAL(5))  'Convert the result to a string before printing
