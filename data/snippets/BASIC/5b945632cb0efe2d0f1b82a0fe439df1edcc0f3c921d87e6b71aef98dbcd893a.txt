' This code snippet will calculate the average of a series of numbers entered by the user

' Initialize array to store input numbers
DIM Numbers(10) 

' Prompt user to enter numbers
INPUT "Enter numbers, press Enter after each number:" 

' Loop through array and store user input
FOR i = 1 TO 10 
  INPUT Numbers(i) 
NEXT i 

' Initialize variables to store sum and average
DIM Sum, Average 

' Calculate sum of numbers
FOR j = 1 TO 10 
  Sum = Sum + Numbers(j) 
NEXT j 

' Calculate average
Average = Sum / 10 

' Print result to screen
PRINT "The average of the numbers you entered is: " + Average 

' Check if average is greater than 50
IF Average > 50 THEN 
  PRINT "Average is greater than 50!" 
ELSE 
  PRINT "Average is not greater than 50."
