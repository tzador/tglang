REM Calculate the square root of a number
INPUT "Enter a number: "; num
LET guess = num / 2
LET error = 0.0001

REM Loop until the guess is accurate enough
WHILE ABS(guess * guess - num) > error
    LET guess = (guess + num / guess) / 2
END WHILE

REM Print the result
PRINT "Square root of "; num; " is "; guess
