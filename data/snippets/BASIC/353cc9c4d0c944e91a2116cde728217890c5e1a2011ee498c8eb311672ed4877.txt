'''' This code snippet is a simple program that calculates the factorial of a number
'''' and displays the result.

REM Define input variable
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num

REM Set initial values
factorial = 1
count = 1

REM Loop through numbers from 1 to input
FOR i = 1 TO num
    REM Multiply current factorial value with the current count
    factorial = factorial * count
    REM Increase count by 1
    count = count + 1
NEXT

REM Display the result
PRINT "The factorial of "; num; " is "; factorial
