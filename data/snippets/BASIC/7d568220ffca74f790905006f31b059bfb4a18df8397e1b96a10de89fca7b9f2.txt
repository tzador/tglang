'Here is a complex code snippet in BASIC
'I decided to create a program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
'First, we ask the user for the number that they want the sequence to go up to
INPUT "Enter a number: ", n
'A variable to keep track of the previous number in the sequence
PREV1 = 0
'A variable to keep track of the current number in the sequence
PREV2 = 1
'Loop through the sequence until the current number is greater than the given number
FOR i = 1 TO n
    'Generate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
    NEXT = PREV1 + PREV2
    'Print the current number
    PRINT PREV2
    'Update the previous numbers
    PREV1 = PREV2
    PREV2 = NEXT
NEXT
'Output:
'Enter a number: 10
