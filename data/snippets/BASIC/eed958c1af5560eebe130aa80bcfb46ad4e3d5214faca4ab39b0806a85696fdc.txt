DIM num, fact, i ' Declare variables for number, factorial and loop counter
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num ' Prompt user to enter number
fact = 1 ' Initialize factorial to 1
FOR i = 1 TO num ' Loop from 1 to given number
fact = fact * i ' Multiply factorial by loop counter
NEXT i ' End of loop
PRINT "The factorial of "; num; " is "; fact ' Display the factorial
