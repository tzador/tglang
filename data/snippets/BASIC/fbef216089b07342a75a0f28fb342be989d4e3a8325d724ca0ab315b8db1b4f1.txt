' This is a code snippet in BASIC
' It calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term

' Define a function to calculate the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
DEF FN FIB(n)
    ' Initialize variables for the first and second terms
    LET a = 0
    LET b = 1

    ' Loop through the terms up to the specified term
    FOR i = 3 TO n
        ' Calculate the next term in the sequence by adding the previous two terms
        LET c = a + b

        ' Update variables for the next iteration
        LET a = b
        LET b = c
    NEXT i

    ' Return the nth term in the sequence as the output of the function
    = b
END DEF

' Prompt the user to enter the term they want to calculate
INPUT "Enter the term to calculate: ", n

' Call the function to calculate the nth term
LET fib_term = FN FIB(n)

' Print the result to the screen
PRINT "The " + n + "th term in the Fibonacci sequence is " + fib_term + "."
