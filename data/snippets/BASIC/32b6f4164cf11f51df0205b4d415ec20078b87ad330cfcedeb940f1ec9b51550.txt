' This code snippet calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
' Input the value of n, the term you want to find
INPUT "Enter the value of n: ", n

' Initialize variables for the first two terms of the sequence
LET a = 0 ' first term
LET b = 1 ' second term
LET i = 2 ' counter

' Calculate the nth term using a loop
WHILE i <= n
    ' Compute the next term in the sequence by adding the previous two terms
    LET c = a + b
    ' Update the values of a and b for the next iteration
    LET a = b
    LET b = c
    ' Increment the counter
    LET i = i + 1
WEND

' Output the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
PRINT "The " + n + "th term of the Fibonacci sequence is: " + c

' Calculate the golden ratio using the Fibonacci sequence
LET goldenRatio = c / b

' Output the golden ratio
PRINT "The golden ratio is: " + goldenRatio
