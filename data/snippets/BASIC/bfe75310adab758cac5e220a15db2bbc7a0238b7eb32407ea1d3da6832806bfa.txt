` This program will calculate the sum of two numbers
' Define two variables with initial values
LET num1 = 5 'first number
LET num2 = 10 'second number

' Calculate the sum and store it in a third variable
LET sum = num1 + num2

' Print the result to the console
PRINT "The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + sum + "."

' Add a condition to check if the sum is greater than 20
IF sum > 20 THEN
    ' If the condition is met, print a message
    PRINT "The sum is greater than 20."
ELSE
    ' If the condition is not met, print a different message
    PRINT "The sum is less than 20."
END IF

' Add a loop to continuously ask for user inputs and print the sum until the user enters a specific keyword
DO
    ' Ask for user input
    INPUT "Enter two numbers (separated by a space): ", num1, num2
    
    ' Calculate the sum
    LET sum = num1 + num2
    
    ' Print the result to the console
    PRINT "The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + sum + "."
LOOP UNTIL num1 = "exit"

' Add functions to calculate the product and difference of two numbers
FUNCTION product(x, y)
    LET product = x * y
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION difference(x, y)
    LET difference = x - y
END FUNCTION

' Use the functions to calculate and print the product and difference of two numbers
LET num3 = 2
LET num4 = 6
PRINT "The product of " + num3 + " and " + num4 + " is " + product(num3, num4) + "."
PRINT "The difference between " + num3 + " and " + num4 + " is " + difference(num3, num4) + "."
