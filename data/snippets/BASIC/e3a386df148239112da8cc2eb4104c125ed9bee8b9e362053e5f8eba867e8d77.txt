REM This is a comment that explains the purpose of the code snippet

' Declare and initialize variables
DIM x AS INTEGER
DIM y AS INTEGER
LET x = 5
LET y = 10

' Use a FOR loop to iterate through a range of values
FOR i = x to y STEP 1
  PRINT "Current value of i is: " + STR$(i) ' Concatenates strings and converts integer to string
  ' Use an IF statement to check for a condition
  IF i MOD 2 = 0 THEN
    PRINT "i is an even number"
  ELSE
    PRINT "i is an odd number"
  END IF
NEXT i ' End of FOR loop, goes back to the beginning and increments i by 1

' Use a WHILE loop to continue executing code until a condition is met
WHILE x < y
  PRINT "x is less than y"
  LET x = x + 1 ' Increment x by 1
WEND ' End of WHILE loop, goes back to the beginning and executes code until x is no longer less than y

' Use a SELECT CASE statement to handle multiple conditions
SELECT CASE x
  CASE 1
    PRINT "x is equal to 1"
  CASE 2
    PRINT "x is equal to 2"
  CASE 3
    PRINT "x is equal to 3"
  CASE ELSE
    PRINT "x is not equal to 1, 2, or 3"
END SELECT ' End of SELECT CASE statement

' Use a DO loop to continuously execute code until a condition is met
DO
  PRINT "x is now: " + STR$(x)
  LET x = x - 1 ' Decrement x by 1
LOOP WHILE x > 0 ' Loop will continue until x is no longer greater than 0

' Use a SUB procedure to define a block of code that can be called multiple times
SUB generateRandomNumber()
  RANDOMIZE ' Initialize the random number generator
  LET x = INT(RND * 10) + 1 ' Generate a random number between 1 and 10
  PRINT "Random number is: " + STR$(x)
END SUB ' End of generateRandomNumber procedure

' Call the generateRandomNumber procedure 5 times
FOR i = 1 to 5
  CALL generateRandomNumber()
NEXT i ' End of FOR loop

' Use a FUNCTION procedure to define a block of code that returns a value
FUNCTION cube(number)
  cube = number ^ 3 ' Calculate the cube of the given number
END FUNCTION ' End of cube function

' Use the cube function to calculate and print the cube of a given number
DIM result AS INTEGER
LET result = cube(5)
PRINT "Cube of 5 is: " + STR$(result)
