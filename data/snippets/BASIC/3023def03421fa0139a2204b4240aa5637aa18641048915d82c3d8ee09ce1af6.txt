REM Program to find the LCM of two numbers

REM Function to find the GCD of two numbers
DEF FN gcd(a,b)
  IF a=0 THEN
    gcd=b
  ELSE
    gcd=FN gcd(b MOD a,a)
END DEF

REM Function to find the LCM of two numbers
DEF FN lcm(a,b)
  lcm=(a*b)/FN gcd(a,b)
END DEF

REM Main program
PRINT "Enter two numbers:"
INPUT a,b

REM Validating input
IF a<0 OR b<0 THEN
  PRINT "Invalid input"
  END

REM Finding LCM
lcm=FN lcm(a,b)

REM Printing result
PRINT "LCM of"; a; "and"; b; "is:"; lcm

REM End of program
