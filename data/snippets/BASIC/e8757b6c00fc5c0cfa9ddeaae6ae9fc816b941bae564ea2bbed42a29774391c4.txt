' This program multiplies two input numbers and outputs the result
INPUT "Enter first number: ", num1 ' prompts user to enter first number
INPUT "Enter second number: ", num2 ' prompts user to enter second number
result = 0 ' initializes variable to store result
FOR i = 1 TO num1 ' starts a for loop from 1 to first number
    FOR j = 1 TO num2 ' starts a for loop from 1 to second number
        result = result + 1 ' increases result by 1 for each iteration
    NEXT j ' ends inner for loop
NEXT i ' ends outer for loop
PRINT "The result of ", num1, " * ", num2, " is "; result ' outputs the result to the user
