REM This program calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm
input "Enter the first number: ", x
input "Enter the second number: ", y
FOR i = 1 to y
    REM check if both numbers are evenly divisible by i
    IF x MOD i = 0 AND y MOD i = 0 THEN
        REM set the current value of i as the potential GCD
        gcd = i
    END IF
NEXT
REM output the calculated GCD
PRINT "The GCD of " + x + " and " + y + " is " + gcd
