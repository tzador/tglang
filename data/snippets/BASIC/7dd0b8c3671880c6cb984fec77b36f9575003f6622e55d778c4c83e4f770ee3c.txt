' Sample code snippet in BASIC
' This program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion
' Input: integer n
' Output: factorial of n

' Define a function to calculate the factorial using recursion
DEF FN calculateFactorial(n)
    IF n <= 1 THEN
        ' Base case, return 1 when n is 0 or 1
        FN = 1
    ELSE
        ' Recursive case, call the function again with n-1 and multiply with n
        FN = n * FN(n-1)
    END IF
END DEF

' Get user input for n
INPUT "Enter a number: ", n
IF n < 0 THEN
    ' If n is negative, return an error
    PRINT "Error: Factorial cannot be calculated for negative numbers."
ELSE
    ' Call the function to calculate factorial and print the result
    PRINT "The factorial of "; n; " is "; FN(calculateFactorial(n))
