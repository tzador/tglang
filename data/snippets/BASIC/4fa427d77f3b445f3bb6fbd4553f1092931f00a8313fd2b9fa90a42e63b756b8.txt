REM First, we declare some variables
DIM a AS INTEGER
DIM b AS INTEGER
DIM c AS INTEGER
REM Next, we prompt the user to input values for our variables
INPUT "Enter value for a: ", a
INPUT "Enter value for b: ", b
INPUT "Enter value for c: ", c
REM Then, we perform some calculations using our variables
LET d = a + b
LET e = b * c
LET f = c - a
REM Finally, we print out the results to the user
PRINT "The sum of a and b is ", d
PRINT "The product of b and c is ", e
PRINT "The difference of c and a is ", f
