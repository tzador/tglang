REM This code calculates and prints the Fibonacci series up to a user-inputted number
INPUT "Enter a positive integer: ", num
REM initialize variables
LET first = 0
LET second = 1
LET current = 1
REM loop through the series until current number is greater than num
WHILE current <= num
    PRINT current; " "  REM print current number
    LET third = first + second  REM calculate next number in the series
    LET first = second  REM update variables for next iteration
    LET second = third
    LET current = current + 1
