Rem Generate a list of prime numbers
input "Enter the maximum number: "; maximum

Rem Initialize list of prime numbers and variables
dim primes$(2)
primes$(1) = "2"
count = 1
n = 3
prime = 1

Rem Loop through all numbers up to maximum
For i = 3 to maximum step 2

    Rem Check if number is divisible by a lower prime number
    For j = 1 to count
        If i mod primes$(j) = 0 then
            prime = 0
            Exit For
        End If
    Next j

    Rem If number is not divisible, add to list of prime numbers
    If prime = 1 then
        count = count + 1
        dim preserve primes$(count + 1)
        primes$(count + 1) = i
    End If

    prime = 1
Next i

Rem Print out list of prime numbers
Print "The prime numbers up to " + maximum + " are:"
For i = 1 to count + 1
    Print primes$(i)
Next i
