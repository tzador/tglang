REM Note: This code is written in BASIC language

10 REM Generate a random array of numbers between 1 and 100
20 DIM array(10) AS INTEGER
30 FOR i = 1 TO 10
40    array(i) = INT(RND * 100 + 1)
50 NEXT i

REM Sort the array in ascending order
60 FOR i = 1 TO 9
70    FOR j = i+1 TO 10
80        IF array(i) > array(j) THEN
90            TEMP = array(i)
100            array(i) = array(j)
110            array(j) = TEMP
120        END IF
130    NEXT j
140 NEXT i

REM Print the sorted array
150 PRINT "The sorted array is:"
160 FOR i = 1 TO 10
170    PRINT array(i)
180 NEXT i

REM Calculate the sum of all elements in the array
190 SUM = 0
200 FOR i = 1 TO 10
210    SUM = SUM + array(i)
220 NEXT i

REM Calculate the average of the elements in the array
230 AVERAGE = SUM/10

REM Print the average
240 PRINT "The average is: " + AVERAGE
250 END
