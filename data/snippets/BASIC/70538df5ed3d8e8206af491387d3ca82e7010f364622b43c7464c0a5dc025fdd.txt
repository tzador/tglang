REM This is a BASIC code snippet.
REM It includes variable declarations, a for loop, conditional statements, and input/output.

DIM num AS INTEGER     REM declaring a variable of type integer
DIM sum AS INTEGER     REM declaring another variable of type integer
sum = 0

FOR i = 1 TO 5        REM for loop to iterate 5 times
    IF (i MOD 2) = 0 THEN     REM checking if i is even
        sum = sum + i         REM adding i to sum if i is even
        PRINT "Even number added to sum."
    ELSE
        PRINT "Odd number, not added to sum."
    END IF
NEXT i            REM end of for loop

PRINT "Final sum is: "; sum      REM output final sum
