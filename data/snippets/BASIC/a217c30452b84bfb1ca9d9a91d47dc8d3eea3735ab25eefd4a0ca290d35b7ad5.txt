REM Define a subroutine that takes in two parameters
DEF SUB NewSub(a, b)
    REM Assign the sum of the parameters to a variable
    c = a + b
    PRINT "The sum is: "; c
END SUB
REM Call the subroutine and pass in arguments
CALL NewSub(4, 5)
REM Declare an array
DIM arr(5)
REM Loop through the array and assign values to each element
FOR i = 1 TO 5
    arr(i) = i * 2
NEXT
REM Define a function that takes in an array as a parameter
DEF FN Average(nums())
    REM Calculate the average of the array elements
    total = 0
    FOR j = 1 TO 5
        total = total + nums(j)
    NEXT
    avg = total / 5
    REM Return the average
    FN = avg
END DEF
REM Call the function and pass in the array as an argument
average = FN Average(arr)
REM Print the result
PRINT "The average is: "; average
