' This program calculates the value of pi using the Gregory-Leibniz series
' Initialize variables
pi = 0 ' Variable for storing the value of pi
term = 1 ' Variable for calculating each term in the series
sign = 1 ' Variable for alternating the sign of the series
iterations = 100000 ' Number of iterations for the series

' Loop through the series
FOR i = 1 TO iterations
    pi = pi + (4 * sign / term) ' Add the current term to the value of pi
    term = term + 2 ' Increase the value of the term by 2
    sign = sign * -1 ' Alternate the sign of the series
NEXT i

' Print the final value of pi
PRINT "The value of pi is: " + STR$(pi)
