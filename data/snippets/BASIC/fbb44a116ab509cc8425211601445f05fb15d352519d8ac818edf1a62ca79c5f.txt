'This program takes two numbers from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations on them

'Define variables to store user input
DIM firstNum AS INTEGER
DIM secondNum AS INTEGER

'Prompt user for input and store in variables
INPUT "Enter the first number: ", firstNum
INPUT "Enter the second number: ", secondNum

'Perform arithmetic operations
LET sum = firstNum + secondNum
LET difference = firstNum - secondNum
LET product = firstNum * secondNum
LET quotient = firstNum / secondNum

'Print results
PRINT "The sum is: " + sum
PRINT "The difference is: " + difference
PRINT "The product is: " + product
PRINT "The quotient is: " + quotient
