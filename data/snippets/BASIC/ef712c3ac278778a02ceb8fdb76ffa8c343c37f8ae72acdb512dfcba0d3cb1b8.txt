'This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user

INPUT "Enter a number: ", N 'takes user input for the number
F = 1 'initializes the factorial variable to 1

IF N > 0 THEN 'checks if input number is positive
  FOR I = 1 TO N 'for loop from 1 to the input number
    F = F * I 'multiplies the factorial variable by the current number in the loop
  NEXT I 'moves to the next number in the loop
END IF 'ends the if statement

PRINT "The factorial of "; N; " is "; F 'prints the result

END 'terminates the program
