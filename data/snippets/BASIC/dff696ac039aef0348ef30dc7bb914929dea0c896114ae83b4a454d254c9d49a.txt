REM This is a program to calculate the factorial of a given number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num            ' Prompt the user to enter a number
numCopy = num                            ' Make a copy of the input number
factorial = 1                            ' Initialize factorial variable with value 1

REM Check if the input number is negative or zero
IF numCopy < 0 OR numCopy = 0 THEN
    PRINT "Factorial undefined for negative numbers or zero."    ' Print error message
    GOTO end                               ' Go to end of program
END IF

REM Loop to calculate factorial
FOR i = numCopy TO 1 STEP -1              ' Loop from input number to 1 in steps of -1
    factorial = factorial * i            ' Multiply current value of factorial with loop counter
NEXT i

PRINT "Factorial of "; num; " is "; factorial    ' Print the factorial

end:                                     ' End of program
END                                      ' End of BASIC program
