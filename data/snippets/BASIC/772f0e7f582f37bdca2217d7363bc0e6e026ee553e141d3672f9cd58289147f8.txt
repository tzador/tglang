' This program calculates the average of three numbers
' Input three numbers
INPUT "Enter first number: ", num1
INPUT "Enter second number: ", num2
INPUT "Enter third number: ", num3

' Calculate and store the sum of the three numbers
sum = num1 + num2 + num3

' Calculate and store the average of the three numbers
avg = sum / 3

' Display the average
PRINT "The average of", num1, ",", num2, "and", num3, "is", avg

' This program uses a function to calculate square of a number
' Function to calculate square of a number
DEF FN square(num)
    square = num * num
END DEF

' Input a number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num

' Calculate and display the square of the number using the function
PRINT "The square of", num, "is", FN square(num)

' This program uses a loop to calculate and display the first 10 terms of fibonacci sequence
' Initialize the first two terms of fibonacci sequence
a = 0: b = 1

' Display the first two terms
PRINT "Terms of fibonacci sequence:"
PRINT a, b

' Loop to calculate and display the next 8 terms 
FOR i = 3 TO 10
    c = a + b
    PRINT c
    a = b
    b = c
NEXT i
