REM Set initial values for variables
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4
e = 5

REM Perform calculations using variables
sum = a + b + c + d + e
average = sum / 5
product = a * b * c * d * e
power = e ^ 4

REM Print results to screen
PRINT "Sum:", sum
PRINT "Average:", average
PRINT "Product:", product
PRINT "Power:", power
