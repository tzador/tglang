' This program calculates the factorial of a given number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", n 'takes user input for the number to calculate factorial
fact = 1 'initializes factorial variable to 1
FOR i = 1 TO n 'loops from 1 to the given number
    fact = fact * i 'multiplies factorial variable by the current number in the loop
NEXT i 'moves to the next number in the loop
PRINT "The factorial of "; n; " is "; fact 'prints the result with a descriptive message
END 'ends the program
