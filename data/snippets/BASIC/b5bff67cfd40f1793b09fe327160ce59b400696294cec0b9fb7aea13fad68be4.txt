REM This program calculates the factorial of a given number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num

REM check if number is negative
IF num < 0 THEN
    PRINT "Factorial cannot be calculated for negative numbers."

REM initialize factorial variable
factorial = 1

REM loop through each number from 1 to num
FOR i = 1 TO num
    factorial = factorial * i
NEXT i

PRINT "Factorial of " + STR$(num) + " is " + STR$(factorial)
