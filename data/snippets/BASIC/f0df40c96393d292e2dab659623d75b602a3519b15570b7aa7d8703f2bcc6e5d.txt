' This code snippet generates a random list of numbers and allows the user to search for a number within the list.

' Define variables
DIM nums(10) AS INTEGER
DIM search AS INTEGER
DIM found AS BOOLEAN

' Generate a random list of numbers
FOR i = 1 TO 10
  nums(i) = RND * 100
NEXT i

' Ask user for input
PRINT "Please enter a number to search for:"
INPUT search

' Search for number in list
FOR i = 1 TO 10
  IF nums(i) = search THEN
    found = TRUE
    EXIT FOR
  END IF
NEXT i

' Output results
IF found THEN
  PRINT "Number " + STR$(search) + " was found in the list."
ELSE
  PRINT "Number " + STR$(search) + " was not found in the list."
END IF
