REM This is a program to calculate the square root of a given number
PRINT "Enter a number: "; // prompts the user to enter a number
INPUT X // stores the user input in the variable X 
LET G = X / 2 // assigns half of the user input to the variable G 
LET E = 0.000001 // sets the error margin to a very small value 
WHILE ABS(G^2 - X) > E // performs a loop until the error margin is reached 
    LET G = (G + X/G) / 2 // updates the value of G using the Newton's method 
WEND
LET S = G // assigns the final value of G to the variable S, which is the square root 
PRINT "The square root of "; X; " is "; S // prints the result in a user-friendly format
END // ends the program
