REM Define variables
DIM A,B,C
REM Set initial values
A = 10
B = 5
REM Calculate sum
C = A + B
REM Print result
PRINT "The sum of A and B is: " ; C
REM Loop through numbers 1 to 10
FOR I = 1 TO 10
    REM Multiply current number by 10
    AB = I * 10
    REM Subtract 5 from result
    CD = AB - 5
    REM If result is greater than 50, print it
    IF CD > 50 THEN
        PRINT "Result is greater than 50: " ; CD
    END IF
NEXT I
