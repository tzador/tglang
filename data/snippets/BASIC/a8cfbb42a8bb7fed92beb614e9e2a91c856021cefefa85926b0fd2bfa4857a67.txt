' This is a complex code snippet in BASIC
' It calculates the sum of all even numbers from 0 to a given number

' Initialize a variable to store the sum
SUM = 0

' Initialize a variable to store the given number
N = 10

' Loop through all numbers from 0 to N
FOR I = 0 TO N
    ' Check if current number is even
    IF I MOD 2 = 0 THEN
        ' Add even number to the sum
        SUM = SUM + I
    END IF
NEXT I

' Print the sum of even numbers
PRINT "Sum of even numbers from 0 to " + STR$(N) + " is " + STR$(SUM)

' Output:
' Sum of even numbers from 0 to 10 is 30
