' This code snippet calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height

' Define variables for base and height
DIM base AS DOUBLE
DIM height AS DOUBLE

' Prompt user to input base and height
PRINT "Enter the base of the triangle"
INPUT base
PRINT "Enter the height of the triangle"
INPUT height

' Calculate area of triangle using formula: Area = (base * height)/2
DIM area AS DOUBLE
area = (base * height)/2

' Display result
PRINT "The area of the triangle with base "; base; " and height "; height; " is "; area
