' This is a BASIC program to calculate the factorial of a number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num     ' prompts the user to enter a number
LET fact = 1                     ' initializes the factorial variable to 1
WHILE num <> 0                   ' loops until num is 0
    LET fact = fact * num         ' multiplies the factorial variable with the current number
    LET num = num - 1             ' decrements the number by 1
WEND                            ' ends the while loop
PRINT "The factorial is: ", fact  ' prints the calculated factorial
