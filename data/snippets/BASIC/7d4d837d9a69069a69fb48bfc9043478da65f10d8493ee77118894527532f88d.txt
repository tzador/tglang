REM This is a comment in BASIC

INPUT "Enter a number: ", num1 "Prompt user for input
INPUT "Enter another number: ", num2

REM Addition of two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

REM Output the result
PRINT "The sum is: "; sum

REM Loop to perform subtraction
FOR i = 1 TO 5 STEP 1
    REM Prompt user for input
    INPUT "Enter a number to subtract from sum: ", num3
    REM Subtract input from sum
    sum = sum - num3
NEXT i

REM Output the final result
PRINT "The final result is: "; sum

REM Check if sum is a prime number
FOR i = 2 TO sum-1
    IF sum MOD i = 0 THEN
        PRINT sum; " is not a prime number"
        END
    END IF
NEXT i

REM If no numbers divide sum evenly, it is a prime number
PRINT sum; " is a prime number"

REM Fibonacci sequence
a = 0
b = 1
FOR i = 1 TO 10 STEP 1
    PRINT a
    c = a + b
    a = b
    b = c
NEXT i

REM Print ASCII values from 32 to 126
FOR i = 32 TO 126 STEP 1
    PRINT i; " represents "; CHR$(i)
NEXT i

REM Calculate factorial of a number
INPUT "Enter a number to find factorial: ", num4
fact = 1
FOR i = 1 TO num4 STEP 1
    fact = fact * i
NEXT i

REM Output the factorial
PRINT "Factorial of "; num4; " is: "; fact

REM Define a function to calculate area of a circle
DEF FNarea(radius)
    area = 3.14159 * radius * radius
END DEF

REM Prompt user for input and calculate area
INPUT "Enter radius of a circle: ", rad
areaCircle = FNarea(rad)

REM Output the area
PRINT "The area of the circle is: "; areaCircle

REM Declaring and filling an array
DIM fruits(3)
fruits(0) = "apple"
fruits(1) = "banana"
fruits(2) = "orange"
fruits(3) = "strawberry"

REM Loop to print array elements
FOR i = 0 TO 3 STEP 1
    PRINT fruits(i)
NEXT i

REM Sorting an array in ascending order
FOR i = 0 TO 2 STEP 1
    FOR j = i + 1 TO 3 STEP 1
        IF fruits(i) > fruits(j) THEN
            temp = fruits(i)
            fruits(i) = fruits(j)
            fruits(j) = temp
        END IF
    NEXT j
NEXT i

REM Output the sorted array
PRINT "Sorted array:"
FOR i = 0 TO 3 STEP 1
    PRINT fruits(i)
NEXT i

REM Subroutine to print multiplication table
DIM table(10, 10)
FOR i = 1 TO 10 STEP 1
    FOR j = 1 TO 10 STEP 1
        table(i, j) = i * j
    NEXT j
NEXT i

REM Call the subroutine
GOSUB printTable

REM Subroutine definition
printTable:
    FOR i = 1 TO 10 STEP 1
        FOR j = 1 TO 10 STEP 1
            PRINT table(i, j);
        NEXT j
        PRINT
    NEXT i
RETURN

REM Exit the program
