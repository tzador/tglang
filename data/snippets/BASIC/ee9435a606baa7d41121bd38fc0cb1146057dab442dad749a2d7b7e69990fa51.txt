'This code snippet generates a random list of numbers and checks if the largest number is divisible by the smallest number.

'Initialize variables
n = 10 'Number of elements in list
dim numArray(n) 'Declare an array with size n
dim largestNum 'Variable to store largest number
dim smallestNum 'Variable to store smallest number
dim divisible 'Variable to store whether largest number is divisible by smallest number

'Set initial values for largest and smallest number
largestNum = numArray(0)
smallestNum = numArray(0)

'Generate random list of numbers
for i = 0 to n - 1
    numArray(i) = rnd * 100 'Random number between 0 and 100
next

'Loop through list to find largest and smallest number
for i = 0 to n - 1
    if numArray(i) > largestNum then
        largestNum = numArray(i)
    end if
    if numArray(i) < smallestNum then
        smallestNum = numArray(i)
    end if
next

'Check if largest number is divisible by smallest number
if largestNum mod smallestNum = 0 then
    divisible = true
else
    divisible = false
end if

'Print out results
print "Random list of numbers:"
for i = 0 to n - 1
    print numArray(i)
next
print "Largest number: " + str$(largestNum)
print "Smallest number: " + str$(smallestNum)
if divisible = true then
    print "Largest number is divisible by the smallest number."
else
    print "Largest number is not divisible by the smallest number."
end if
