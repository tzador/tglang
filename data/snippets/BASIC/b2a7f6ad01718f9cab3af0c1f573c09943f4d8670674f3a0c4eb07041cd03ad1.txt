'This code snippet uses BASIC programming language to perform a calculation and print the result.

'Initialize variables
A = 5
B = 10
C = 2

'Multiply A and B, storing the result in D
D = A * B

'Divide D by C, storing the result in E
E = D / C

'Print the result
PRINT "The result is: " + STR$(E)

'END program
