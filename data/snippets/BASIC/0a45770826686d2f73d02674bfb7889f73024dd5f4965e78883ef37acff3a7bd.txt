REM Define two variables
DIM num1 AS INTEGER
DIM num2 AS INTEGER

REM Set initial values for the variables
num1 = 5
num2 = 10

REM Perform arithmetic operations
num1 = num1 + 2
num2 = num2 * 3

REM Print the updated values
PRINT "num1: "; num1
PRINT "num2: "; num2

REM Use conditional statements
IF num1 < num2 THEN
  PRINT "num1 is less than num2"
ELSEIF num1 > num2 THEN
  PRINT "num1 is greater than num2"
ELSE
  PRINT "num1 is equal to num2"
END IF

REM Create a FOR loop to iterate through a range
FOR i = 1 TO 10
  PRINT i
NEXT i

REM Use a WHILE loop to perform a task repeatedly
WHILE num1 <= 20
  PRINT "num1 is currently: "; num1
  num1 = num1 + 1
WEND

REM Define a custom function 
FUNCTION multiply(x, y)
  LET result = x * y
  multiply = result
END FUNCTION

REM Call the function and print the result
LET product = multiply(4, 5)
PRINT "The product is: "; product
