' This code snippet is a program that will calculate the volume of a cube
' The program will prompt the user to input the length of one side of the cube
' and then it will calculate the volume based on that input

' Declaring variables
DIM side_length AS INTEGER ' variable to store the length of the cube side
DIM volume AS INTEGER ' variable to store the calculated volume

' Prompt user for input
PRINT "Enter the length of one side of the cube: " ' prompt user for input
INPUT side_length ' store user input in side_length variable

' Calculate volume
volume = side_length ^ 3 ' use the formula for calculating volume of a cube

' Print result
PRINT "The volume of the cube is: "; volume ' print the calculated volume

END ' end program
