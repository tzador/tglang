# The code snippet begins with "REM" to define comments in BASIC.
# "DIM" is used to define variables and their data types.
# The "AS" keyword is used to specify the data type.
# In this snippet, we have defined three variables: a (integer), b (float), and result (string).

# The next few lines initialize the variables with values, in this case a = 5 and b = 2.5.

# The "IF" statement checks the conditions and performs the specified action if the condition is true.
# In this case, we have two conditions that compare the values of a and b.
# If a is less than b, the first condition is executed and the value of result is set to "a is less than b".
# If a is greater than b, the second condition is executed and the value of result is set to "a is greater than b".
# If neither of the conditions is true, the "ELSE" statement is executed and the value of result is set to "a is equal to b".

# The "END IF" statement marks the end of the IF statement.

# Finally, the "PRINT" statement is used to output the value of result, which will be one of the three strings depending on the conditions.

# Overall, this BASIC code snippet shows the use of variables, data types, conditions, and output statements.
