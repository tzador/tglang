REM Calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence

' Define variables
DIM n, i, a, b, c AS INTEGER
a = 1 ' First term
b = 1 ' Second term
c = 0 ' Temp variable

' Get user input for n
INPUT "Enter the value of n: ", n

' Check if n is valid
IF n < 1 THEN
    PRINT "Invalid input, n must be a positive integer"
    END
END IF

' Loop to calculate nth term
FOR i = 3 TO n
    c = a + b ' Calculate next term
    a = b ' Update first term
    b = c ' Update second term
NEXT i

' Print result
PRINT "The nth term of the Fibonacci sequence is: ", c
