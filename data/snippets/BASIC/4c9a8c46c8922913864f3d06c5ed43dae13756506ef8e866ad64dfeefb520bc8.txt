REM This program calculates the average of a list of numbers

DIM numlist(10) AS INTEGER
REM DIM stands for "dimension" and is used to specify the size and type of variables
REM In this case, we are creating an array called "numlist" with 10 elements of type INTEGER

INPUT "Enter the number of elements in the list: ", count
REM INPUT is used to prompt the user for input and stores it in the variable "count"

FOR i = 1 TO count
REM FOR loop is used to iterate through a set of statements for a specified number of times
INPUT "Enter number " + STR$(i) + ": ", numlist(i)
REM STR$() is used to convert a value to a string, in this case we are converting i to a string to display in the prompt
REM The user input is then stored in the corresponding element of the array

NEXT i
REM END FOR loop

total = 0
REM Setting the variable "total" to 0 to keep track of the sum of all the numbers in the list

FOR i = 1 TO count
total = total + numlist(i)
REM Adding the current element of the array to the total variable
REM The loop will run for the specified number of times and add all the numbers in the list to the total

NEXT i
REM END FOR loop

average = total / count
REM Calculating the average by dividing the total sum by the number of elements in the list

PRINT "The average is: "; average
REM PRINT is used to display the value of a variable or string on the screen
REM In this case, we are displaying the value of the average variable with some additional text for clarity
