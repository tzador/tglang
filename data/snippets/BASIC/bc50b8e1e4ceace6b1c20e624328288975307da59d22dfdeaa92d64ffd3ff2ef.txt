' This program calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
' Definition: The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers.
' Create variables for storing previous two numbers and the result
Dim prev1, prev2, result As Integer
' Prompt user to enter the value of n
PRINT "Enter the value of n: "
' Store n in a variable
INPUT n
' Initialize the previous two numbers to 0 and 1
prev1 = 0
prev2 = 1
' Loop through n - 2 times since the first two numbers are already initialized
FOR i = 1 TO n - 2
  ' Calculate the next term by adding the previous two numbers
  result = prev1 + prev2
  ' Update the previous two numbers to prepare for the next iteration
  prev1 = prev2
  prev2 = result
NEXT i
' Print the result
PRINT "The nth term of the Fibonacci sequence is: " + result
