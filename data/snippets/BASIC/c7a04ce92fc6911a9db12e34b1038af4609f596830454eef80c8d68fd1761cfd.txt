REM This program converts a number from binary to decimal
INPUT "Enter a binary number: ", n

REM Initializing variables
prod = 1
dec = 0
temp = n

REM Looping through each digit in the binary number
FOR i = 1 TO LEN(n)

    REM Calculating the decimal value of the current digit
    digit = VAL(MID$(n, i, 1)) 
    dec = dec + digit * prod
    
    REM Updating the product by multiplying it by 2
    prod = prod * 2

PRINT "The decimal equivalent of " n " is " dec
