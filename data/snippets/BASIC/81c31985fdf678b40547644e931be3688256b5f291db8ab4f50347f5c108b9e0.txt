REM A program to calculate the factorial of a number
INPUT "Enter a positive integer: ";num      'ask user for input
LET fact = 1                                'initialize fact variable
FOR x = 1 TO num                            'loop from 1 to num
    LET fact = fact * x                     'update fact variable
NEXT x                                      'end of loop
PRINT "The factorial of ";num;" is ";fact   'print result
END                                         'end of program
