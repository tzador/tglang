' --- Program to calculate the sum and average of an array of numbers ---
' Dimension the array
DIM numbers(10)
' Set variables for sum and average
DIM sum AS INTEGER
DIM average AS DOUBLE
' Use a for loop to input values into the array
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    INPUT "Enter a number: "; numbers(i)
NEXT i
' Use a for loop to add all the values in the array
FOR j = 1 TO 10
    sum = sum + numbers(j)
NEXT j
' Calculate average
average = sum / 10
' Print the sum and average
PRINT "Sum: "; sum
PRINT "Average: "; average
