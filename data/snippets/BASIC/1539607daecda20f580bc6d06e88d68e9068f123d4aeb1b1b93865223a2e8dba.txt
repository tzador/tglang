' This program calculates the nth Fibonacci number
INPUT "Enter the value of n: ", n ' Input statement to get value of n from user

' Initialize variables
a = 0 ' First term of Fibonacci sequence
b = 1 ' Second term of Fibonacci sequence
c = 0 ' Variable to store the nth Fibonacci number

' Loop to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
FOR i = 3 TO n ' Starting from i = 3 as first two terms are already set
    c = a + b ' Formula to calculate nth Fibonacci number
    a = b ' Update first term
    b = c ' Update second term
NEXT i ' End of loop

' Output the nth Fibonacci number
PRINT "The nth Fibonacci number is: " + STR$(c) ' STR$ converts integer to string for printing
