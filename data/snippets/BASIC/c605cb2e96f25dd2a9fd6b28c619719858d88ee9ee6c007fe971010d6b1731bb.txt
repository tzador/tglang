' This program calculates the factorial of a number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num ' Prompts user to enter a number
fact = 1 ' Set initial value of factorial to 1
FOR i = 1 TO num ' Loop through numbers from 1 to user's input
fact = fact * i ' Multiply current factorial value by the current number
NEXT i ' End of loop
PRINT "The factorial of " + num + " is " + fact ' Output the result
END ' End of program
