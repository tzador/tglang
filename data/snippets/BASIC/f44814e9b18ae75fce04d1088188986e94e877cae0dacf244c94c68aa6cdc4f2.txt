REM This is a BASIC program that calculates the area of a rectangle

INPUT "Enter the length of the rectangle: "; L
INPUT "Enter the width of the rectangle: "; W

REM Formula for calculating the area of a rectangle
LET A = L * W

REM Print the result
PRINT "The area of the rectangle with length " + L + " and width " + W + " is: " + A

REM Clear memory
LET L = NULL
LET W = NULL
LET A = NULL

REM Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
LET P = 2 * (L + W)

REM Print the result
PRINT "The perimeter of the rectangle is: " + P

REM Check if the rectangle is a square
IF L = W THEN
    PRINT "The rectangle is also a square"
ENDIF

REM Terminate the program
