' This is a code snippet in BASIC that calculates the sum of the first 10 numbers
' Declare a variable to store the sum
DIM sum AS INTEGER
' Declare a loop counter
DIM i AS INTEGER
' Initialize the sum variable to 0
sum = 0
' Loop through the first 10 numbers
FOR i = 1 TO 10
' Add the current number to the sum
sum = sum + i
' Print the current sum to the console
PRINT "Current sum: " + sum
NEXT
' Print the final sum
PRINT "Final sum: " + sum
