' This code snippet calculates the average of an array of numbers

' Initialize array of numbers
DIM numbers(5) AS INTEGER

' Fill array with numbers
numbers(0) = 22
numbers(1) = 15
numbers(2) = 10
numbers(3) = 18
numbers(4) = 27
numbers(5) = 34

' Initialize variables for sum of numbers and average
sum = 0
avg = 0

' Loop through array and calculate sum of numbers
FOR i = 0 TO 5
  sum = sum + numbers(i)
NEXT i

' Divide sum by the length of the array to calculate average
avg = sum / 6

' Print average
PRINT "The average of the numbers is: ";avg

' Output:
' The average of the numbers is: 21
