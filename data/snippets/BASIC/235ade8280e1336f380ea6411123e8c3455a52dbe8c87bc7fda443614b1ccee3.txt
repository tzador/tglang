REM This is a program to calculate the factorial of a given number.
REM The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number.
REM For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 = 120

DIM n AS INTEGER       REM n is the input number
DIM factorial AS INTEGER      REM factorial will store the final result
DIM i AS INTEGER      REM i is the counter for the loop
DIM temp AS INTEGER       REM temp variable to store the intermediate values

INPUT "Enter a number: ", n      REM asking user to input a number to calculate factorial
factorial = 1       REM initializing factorial to 1

FOR i = 1 TO n       REM starting the loop from 1 to the input number
    temp = i        REM storing the current value of i in temp
    WHILE temp > 1      REM while loop to calculate factorial by multiplying temp with all numbers less than it
        temp = temp - 1        REM decreasing temp by 1 in each iteration
        factorial = factorial * temp        REM multiplying factorial with temp
    WEND     REM end of while loop when temp is 1
    factorial = factorial * i       REM multiplying factorial with i to get the final result for current iteration
NEXT i       REM end of for loop

PRINT "The factorial of " + STR$(n) + " is " + STR$(factorial)       REM converting factorial and input number to string and printing the result
