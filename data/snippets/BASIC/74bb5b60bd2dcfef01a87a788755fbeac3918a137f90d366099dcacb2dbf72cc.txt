' This program takes user input and calculates their body mass index (BMI) 
' based on their height and weight.

DIM height AS FLOAT ' declaring variable for height
DIM weight AS FLOAT ' declaring variable for weight

INPUT "Enter your height in inches: ", height
INPUT "Enter your weight in pounds: ", weight

DIM bmi AS FLOAT ' declaring variable for BMI

PRINT "Your BMI is: "; bmi
