' This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
' Input: Integer n (the number to calculate the factorial for)
' Output: Integer (the factorial of n)

' Function to calculate factorial
DEF FN factorial(n)
    IF n = 0 THEN ' base case, factorial of 0 is 1
       factorial = 1
    ELSE
       factorial = n * FN factorial(n-1) ' recursively calculate factorial
    END IF
END FN

' Main program
INPUT "Enter a number: ", n ' user inputs the number
PRINT "Factorial of "; n; " is: ", FN factorial(n) ' call the factorial function
