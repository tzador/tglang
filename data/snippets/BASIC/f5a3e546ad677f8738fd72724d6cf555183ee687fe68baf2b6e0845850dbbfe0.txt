' This program calculates the first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence

' Initialize variables
DIM a AS INTEGER
DIM b AS INTEGER
DIM c AS INTEGER
DIM n AS INTEGER

' Set initial values for first three terms
LET a = 0
LET b = 1
LET c = 1

' Print header and first three terms
PRINT "Fibonacci Sequence"
PRINT a
PRINT b

' Loop through remaining terms
FOR n = 3 TO 19
    ' Calculate next term
    LET c = a + b
    ' Print next term
    PRINT c
    ' Update values for next calculation
    LET a = b
    LET b = c
NEXT n

' Print final term
PRINT "20th term:"
PRINT c
