' This program calculates the average of three numbers

' Declare and initialize variables for the three numbers
DIM num1 AS INTEGER = 5 
DIM num2 AS INTEGER = 10 
DIM num3 AS INTEGER = 15 

' Calculate the sum of the three numbers
DIM sum AS INTEGER = num1 + num2 + num3

' Calculate the average
DIM average AS INTEGER = sum / 3

' Print the result
PRINT "The average of " ; num1; ", " ; num2; ", and " ; num3; " is: " ; average

'Explanation: This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate and print the average of three numbers using BASIC. It starts by declaring and initializing three variables, 'num1', 'num2', and 'num3' with the values 5, 10, and 15 respectively. Then, it calculates the sum of the three numbers and stores it in the variable 'sum'. Next, it calculates the average by dividing the sum by 3 and stores it in the variable 'average'. Finally, it uses the PRINT command to display the result in a user-friendly format. The result will be "The average of 5, 10, and 15 is: 10".
