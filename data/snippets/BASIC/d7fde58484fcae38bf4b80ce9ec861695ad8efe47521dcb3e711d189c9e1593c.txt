' This code snippet takes two numbers as input and
' calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm
'
'Variables declaration
DIM a, b, c, d as INTEGER

' Get user input
INPUT "Enter first number: ", a
INPUT "Enter second number: ", b

' Initialize variables
c = a
d = b

' Main loop to calculate GCD using Euclidean algorithm
WHILE d <> 0
  ' Calculate remainder using division
  c = c MOD d
  ' Swap the value of c and d
  LET temp = c
  LET c = d
  LET d = temp
WEND

' Output the calculated GCD
PRINT "Greatest Common Divisor of " a " and " b " is " c
