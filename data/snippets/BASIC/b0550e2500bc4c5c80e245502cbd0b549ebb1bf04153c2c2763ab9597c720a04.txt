''' BASIC Code Snippet '''

' Program to calculate the sum of an integer array

' Initialize variables
DIM numArr(10) AS INTEGER ' integer array with size 10
DIM sum AS INTEGER ' variable to store sum
DIM i AS INTEGER ' loop counter variable

' Populate array with random integers
FOR i = 0 TO 9
    numArr(i) = INT(RND * 100) ' generate random integer between 0 and 100
NEXT i

' Calculate sum of array elements
FOR i = 0 TO 9
    sum = sum + numArr(i) ' add current element to sum
NEXT i

' Print results
PRINT "Array elements: ", numArr ' print array elements
PRINT "Sum = ", sum ' print sum of array elements

END ' end program
