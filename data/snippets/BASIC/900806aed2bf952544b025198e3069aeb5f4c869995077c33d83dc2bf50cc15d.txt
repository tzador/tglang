REM This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number

INPUT "Please enter the last number in the sequence: ", num

REM check if the input is valid
IF num < 2 THEN
    PRINT "Invalid input. Please enter a number greater than or equal to 2."
    END
END IF

REM define variables for Fibonacci sequence
DIM fib(num) AS INTEGER
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1

REM loop through to calculate Fibonacci numbers
FOR i = 2 TO num
    fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2)
    PRINT fib(i)
NEXT i

REM print the sequence in a readable format
PRINT "The Fibonacci sequence up to " + num + " is:"
FOR j = 0 TO num
    PRINT fib(j)
NEXT j
