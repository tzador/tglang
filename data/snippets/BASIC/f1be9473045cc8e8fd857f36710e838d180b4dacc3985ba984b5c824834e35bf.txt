'This code snippet calculates the factorials of a number
'Input the number to calculate the factorial
INPUT "Enter the number to calculate: "; N
'Initialize the factorial to 1
F=1
'For loop to iterate from 1 to the input number
FOR I=1 TO N
	'Multiply the current factorial with the current number
	F=F*I
NEXT I
'Print the result
PRINT "The factorial of "; N;" is "; F
