DEF FN AMORT(START, RATE, PERIODS)
' This function calculates the monthly amortization for a loan.
' INPUT:
'   START: The starting loan amount
'   RATE: The annual interest rate
'   PERIODS: The number of periods over which the loan will be paid
' OUTPUT:
'   AMORT: The monthly amortization amount

DIM BALANCE, INTEREST, PRINCIPAL, MONTHLY_RATE, MONTHLY_PAYMENT
BALANCE = START

' Calculate the monthly interest rate
MONTHLY_RATE = RATE / 12

' Calculate the monthly payment
MONTHLY_PAYMENT = BALANCE * (MONTHLY_RATE * (1 + MONTHLY_RATE)^PERIODS) / ((1 + MONTHLY_RATE)^PERIODS - 1)

' Loop through the number of periods
FOR I = 1 TO PERIODS
    
    ' Calculate the interest for the current month
    INTEREST = BALANCE * MONTHLY_RATE
    
    ' Calculate the principal for the current month
    PRINCIPAL = MONTHLY_PAYMENT - INTEREST
    
    ' Update the remaining balance
    BALANCE = BALANCE - PRINCIPAL
    
    ' Print the amortization information for the current month
