' This code snippet uses BASIC language to read data from a file and perform mathematical operations on it
OPEN "my_data.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1 ' Open the file for input
DIM nums(10) ' Declare an array to store the numbers read from the file
index = 0 ' Set the index to 0 to start from the beginning of the array
WHILE NOT EOF(1) ' Loop through the file until the end of file is reached
    LINE INPUT #1, data ' Read the data from the file into the variable
    nums(index) = VAL(data) ' Convert the data from string to numerical value and store it in the array
    index = index + 1 ' Increment the index to read the next number from the file
WEND
CLOSE #1 ' Close the file
total = 0 ' Initialize a variable to store the total sum
FOR i = 0 TO 10 ' Loop through the array to calculate the sum
    total = total + nums(i) ' Add the current number to the total
NEXT i
average = total / 10 ' Calculate the average of the numbers
PRINT "The total sum is: " + STR$(total) ' Print the total sum
PRINT "The average is: " + STR$(average) ' Print the average
END ' End the program
