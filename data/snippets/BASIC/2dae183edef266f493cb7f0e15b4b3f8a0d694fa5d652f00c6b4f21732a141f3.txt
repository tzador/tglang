' This program calculates the average of three numbers

' Array to store three numbers
DIM numbers[3]

' Initialize variables
DIM total = 0.00 ' Sum of all three numbers
DIM average = 0.00 ' Calculated average
DIM count = 0 ' Counter for number of inputs

' Loop to get three numbers
FOR i = 1 TO 3
  INPUT "Enter number " + i + ": " , numbers[i] ' Get user input
  total = numbers[i] + total ' Add input to total
  count = count + 1 ' Increment counter
NEXT i

' Calculate average
average = total / count

' Display result to user
PRINT "The average of the three numbers is: " + average
