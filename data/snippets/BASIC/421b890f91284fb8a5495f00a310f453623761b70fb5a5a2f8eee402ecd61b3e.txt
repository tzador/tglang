REM This code snippet will generate all prime numbers between 1 and 100

' Declare an array of boolean values to track whether a number is prime or not
DIM IsPrime(100) AS BOOLEAN

' Initialize all values to true, except for 1 which is not prime
FOR i = 2 TO 100
    IsPrime(i) = TRUE
NEXT
IsPrime(1) = FALSE

' Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark off non-prime numbers
FOR i = 2 TO SQR(100)
    IF IsPrime(i) THEN
        FOR j = i * i TO 100 STEP i
            IsPrime(j) = FALSE
        NEXT
    END IF
NEXT

' Print out all prime numbers
PRINT "The prime numbers between 1 and 100 are:"
FOR i = 1 TO 100
    IF IsPrime(i) THEN
        PRINT i;
    END IF
NEXT

' Output:
' The prime numbers between 1 and 100 are: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97
