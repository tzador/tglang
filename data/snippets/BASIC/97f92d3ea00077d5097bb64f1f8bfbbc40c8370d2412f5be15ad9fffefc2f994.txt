' This program calculates the nth value in the Fibonacci sequence
' We will use a recursive function to solve for this

' First, we define the variables we will be using
DEF FN Fibonacci(n)
    IF n <= 1 THEN ' Base case for the recursive function
        FN = n
    ELSE
        FN = FN (n - 1) + FN (n - 2) ' Recursive call to calculate the nth value
    END IF
END DEF

' Next, we prompt the user to enter the value of n they want to calculate
INPUT "Enter the value of n: "; n

' Error handling in case the user enters a negative number or 0
IF n <= 0 THEN
    PRINT "Please enter a positive integer"
    END
END IF

' Call the recursive function and store the result in a variable
result = FN (n)

' Print the result
PRINT "The nth value in the Fibonacci sequence is: "; result
