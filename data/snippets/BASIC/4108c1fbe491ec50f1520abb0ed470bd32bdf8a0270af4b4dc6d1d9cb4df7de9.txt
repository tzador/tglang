REM Title: Fibonacci Sequence
REM Description: Generates the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence
REM Inputs: n - integer value representing the number of terms to generate
REM Outputs: the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence

REM Function to generate Fibonacci sequence
REM Takes in the number of terms (n) as input
FUNCTION fibonacci(n)

    REM Initialized first two terms of sequence
    a = 0
    b = 1

    REM Loop through n terms
    FOR i = 1 TO n

        REM Print current term
        PRINT a

        REM Calculate next term by adding previous two terms
        c = a + b

        REM Update a and b to continue sequence
        a = b
        b = c
    NEXT

END FUNCTION

REM Ask user to input number of terms to generate
PRINT "Enter number of terms:"

REM Store user input in variable 'n'
INPUT n

REM Call fibonacci function with n as the input
CALL fibonacci(n)

REM Output will be the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence
