' This is a long and complex code snippet in BASIC

' Initialize variables
DIM a(10), b(10)
LET count = 0
LET total = 0

' Input values into array
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    PRINT "Enter a value:"
    INPUT a(i)

    ' Check if input is negative
    IF a(i) < 0 THEN
        PRINT "Invalid input, please enter a positive number"
        INPUT a(i)
    END IF

    ' Add value to total
    LET total = total + a(i)

    ' Add 1 to count
    LET count = count + 1
NEXT i

' Calculate average
LET avg = total / count

' Output results
PRINT "The sum of the numbers is: " ; total
PRINT "The average of the numbers is: " ; avg

' Check if average is above 50
IF avg > 50 THEN
    PRINT "The average is above 50"
ELSE
    PRINT "The average is below 50"
END IF
