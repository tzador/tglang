' This code snippet is a program that calculates the factorial of a given number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num ' Prompts user to enter a number to calculate factorial for
IF num < 0 THEN ' Checks if the number is negative
    PRINT "Factorial cannot be calculated for negative numbers" ' Outputs error message
ELSE IF num = 0 THEN ' Checks if the number is 0
    PRINT "Factorial of 0 is 1" ' Outputs 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1
ELSE ' If number is positive
    result = 1 ' Initial value of factorial
    FOR i = 1 TO num ' Loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to the given number
        result = result * i ' Calculates factorial by multiplying previous result with current number
    NEXT i ' Goes to the next iteration of the loop
    PRINT "Factorial of " + num + " is " + result ' Outputs the final result
END IF ' Ends the if-else block
