SUB Subroutine(i)
    FOR j = 1 TO i STEP 1
        PRINT "Executing the subroutine for the " + j + "th time"
    NEXT j
END SUB
/* This subroutine takes in an integer input and prints out a statement for every iteration, starting from 1 up to the input value. */

CALL Subroutine(5)
/* This will execute the subroutine 5 times, printing out the statement for each iteration. */
