' Generate a sequence of random numbers

' Inputs: length- the length of the sequence

' Output: seq- a sequence of random numbers

' Method: uses the RND function to generate random numbers between 0 and 1, and then multiplies them by a factor and adds an offset to create a wider range of numbers

    seq[i] = rndnum * factor + offset
