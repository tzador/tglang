' This code snippet calculates and prints the factorial of a given number

' First, we prompt the user to enter a positive integer
INPUT "Enter a positive integer: ", num

' Do a error check to ensure the input is positive
IF num < 0 THEN
  PRINT "Error: The number entered must be positive."
  END
ENDIF

' Initialize a variable to hold the factorial value
factorial = 1

' Loop through all the numbers from 1 to the entered number
FOR i = 1 TO num
  ' Multiply the current value of factorial with the current number in the loop
  factorial = factorial * i
NEXT i

' Print the result to the user
PRINT "The factorial of "; num; " is "; factorial
