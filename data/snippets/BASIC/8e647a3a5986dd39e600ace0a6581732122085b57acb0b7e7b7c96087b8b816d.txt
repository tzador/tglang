REM This is a BASIC code snippet that generates a random number between 1 and 100
RANDOMIZE TIMER 'initializes the random number generator with the system timer

REM get a random integer between 1 and 100
number = INT((99 * RND) + 1) ' multiply the result of RND (a number between 0 and 1) by 99, add 1 to ensure result is between 1 and 100, and convert it to an integer

REM print the generated random number
PRINT "The random number is "; number 'concatenate the text with the number variable and print it

END 'end of program
