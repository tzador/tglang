REM This code snippet uses the INPUT, IF, and PRINT statements to create a simple guessing game.

REM Set the random number to be guessed
RANDOMIZE TIMER
random_number = INT(RND * 100) + 1

REM Set initial guess count to 0
guess_count = 0

REM Welcome message
PRINT "Welcome to the guessing game! I have chosen a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?"

REM Ask for user input
INPUT "Enter your guess: ", user_guess

REM Use IF statements to check if user input is correct
IF user_guess = random_number THEN
    PRINT "Congratulations! You guessed the number in only 1 try!"
ELSE
    PRINT "Sorry, that's not the right number. Let's try again."
    IF user_guess < random_number THEN
        PRINT "Hint: The number is higher than your guess."
    ELSE
        PRINT "Hint: The number is lower than your guess."
    END IF
    REM Increase guess count by 1
    guess_count = guess_count + 1
END IF

REM Create a loop to allow multiple guesses
WHILE user_guess <> random_number
    REM Ask for user input
    INPUT "Enter your guess: ", user_guess
    IF user_guess = random_number THEN
        PRINT "Congratulations! You guessed the number in " + STR$(guess_count + 1) + " tries!"
    ELSE
        PRINT "Sorry, that's not the right number. Let's try again."
        IF user_guess < random_number THEN
            PRINT "Hint: The number is higher than your guess."
        ELSE
            PRINT "Hint: The number is lower than your guess."
        END IF
        REM Increase guess count by 1
        guess_count = guess_count + 1
    END IF
