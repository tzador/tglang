' Subroutine for calculating Fibonacci sequence
'
' Input: integer n - the number of terms in the sequence
'
' Output: term - the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
'

' Initialize variables
DIM term AS INTEGER ' variable for storing the current term
DIM previous AS INTEGER ' variable for storing the previous term
DIM secondPrevious AS INTEGER ' variable for storing the term two positions before the current term
DIM i AS INTEGER ' counter variable for loop

' Assign values to variables
term = 0
previous = 0
secondPrevious = 1

' Loop for generating Fibonacci sequence
FOR i = 1 TO n
    ' Calculate the current term by adding the previous two terms
    term = previous + secondPrevious
    ' Update the values of previous and second previous
    secondPrevious = previous
    previous = term
NEXT i

' Print the result
PRINT "The " + n + "th term in the Fibonacci sequence is: " + term
