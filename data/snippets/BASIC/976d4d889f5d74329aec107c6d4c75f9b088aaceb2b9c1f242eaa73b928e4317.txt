'This BASIC code snippet is a function that calculates the mean of a list of numbers.

'Make sure the input is a valid list of numbers, stored in an array
'and the length of the array is greater than 0
'If the input is not valid, return an error code of -1
'If the input is empty, return an error code of -2

FUNCTION calculateMean(numbers() AS INTEGER, length AS INTEGER) AS FLOAT
	'Initialize variables
	DIM i AS INTEGER
	DIM sum AS FLOAT

	'Check if input is valid
	IF length <= 0 THEN
		RETURN -1
	ELSE IF length > UBOUND(numbers) THEN
		RETURN -1
	END IF

	'Loop through the array and calculate the sum of the numbers
	FOR i = 0 TO length-1 STEP 1
		sum = sum + numbers(i)
	NEXT

	'Calculate the mean
	'Set the result to be a FLOAT instead of an INTEGER to avoid integer division
	DIM mean AS FLOAT
	mean = sum / length

	'Return the mean
	RETURN mean
