' This is a BASIC code snippet that uses conditional branching and looping
' to generate a complex mathematical calculation - the factorial of a number.

' Prompt user for input
INPUT "Enter a number: "; n

' Initialize variables
result = 1
i = n

' Use a WHILE loop to perform calculations until i reaches 1
WHILE i > 1
    ' Use an IF-THEN statement to check if i is even or odd
    IF i MOD 2 = 0 THEN
        ' Use a FOR loop to multiply result by all even numbers up to i
        FOR j = 1 TO i STEP 2
            result = result * j
        NEXT j
    ELSE
        ' Use a FOR loop to multiply result by all odd numbers up to i
        FOR j = 1 TO i STEP 2
            result = result * j
        NEXT j
    END IF
    ' Decrement i
    i = i - 1
END WHILE

' Display the factorial of the input number
PRINT "The factorial of "; n; " is "; result

' There is also an alternative method using a recursive function
' Uncomment the following lines to use it instead of the loop-based method

' FUNCTION factorial(x)
'     IF x = 0 OR x = 1 THEN
'         factorial = 1
'     ELSE
'         factorial = x * factorial(x - 1)
'     END IF
' END FUNCTION

' result = factorial(n)
' PRINT "The factorial of "; n; " is "; result
