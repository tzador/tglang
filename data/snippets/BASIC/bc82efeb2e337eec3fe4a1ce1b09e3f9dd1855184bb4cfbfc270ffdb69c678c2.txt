REM This program calculates the factorial of a user-inputted number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", N :: REM get input from user
IF N = 0 THEN :: REM if input is 0, factorial is 1
    PRINT "Factorial of 0 is 1"
ELSE :: REM if input is not 0, proceed with calculation
    F = 1 :: REM initialize accumulator variable
    FOR I = 1 TO N :: REM loop from 1 to user input
        F = F * I :: REM multiply accumulator by current loop counter
    NEXT :: REM repeat loop until condition is met
    PRINT "Factorial of "; N; " is "; F
END IF :: REM end of conditional statement
END :: REM end of program
