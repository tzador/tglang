' This program finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers

CLS ' Clears the screen
INPUT "Enter first number: ", Num1 ' Prompt user to input first number
INPUT "Enter second number: ", Num2 ' Prompt user to input second number

REM Main loop for finding greatest common divisor

DIM Rem AS INTEGER ' Declaration of remainder variable

IF Num1 < Num2 THEN ' Check if first number is smaller than second number
	LET X = Num1 ' Assign smaller number to X variable
ELSE
	LET X = Num2 ' Assign smaller number to X variable
END IF

FOR I = 1 TO X STEP 1 ' For loop to check all numbers from 1 to X

    IF Num1 MOD I = 0 AND Num2 MOD I = 0 THEN ' Check if both numbers are divisible by current number
        LET Rem = I ' Assign current number to remainder variable
    END IF

NEXT I ' End of for loop

' Print result to user
PRINT "The greatest common divisor of " + Num1 + " and " + Num2 + " is " + Rem

END ' End of program
