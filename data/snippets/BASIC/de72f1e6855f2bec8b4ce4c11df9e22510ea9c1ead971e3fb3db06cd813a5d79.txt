' This is a BASIC program that generates a random number and outputs it
' **Variables**
DIM a AS INTEGER ' variable to store random number
DIM b AS INTEGER ' variable to store upper limit
DIM c AS INTEGER ' variable to store lower limit
DIM d AS INTEGER ' variable to store difference between upper and lower limit
DIM e AS INTEGER ' variable to store temporary random number
' **Input**
INPUT "Enter the upper limit: ", b ' prompt user to enter the upper limit
INPUT "Enter the lower limit: ", c ' prompt user to enter the lower limit
' **Processing**
d = b - c ' calculate the difference between upper and lower limit
RANDOMIZE TIMER ' initialize random number generator with current time
e = INT(RND * (d + 1)) ' generate a random number between 0 and difference 
a = e + c ' adjust the random number to fit within the specified limits
' **Output**
PRINT "The random number between " + STR$(c) + " and " + STR$(b) + " is " + STR$(a) ' print the random number with the specified limits
END ' end the program
