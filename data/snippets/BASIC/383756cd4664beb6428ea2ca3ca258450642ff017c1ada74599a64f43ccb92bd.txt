REM This code computes the Fibonacci numbers in a loop
REM User inputs the number of terms to compute
REM Initialize variables
LET previous = 0
LET current = 1
LET i = 1
DIM FibArray[i]

REM Loop to compute Fibonacci numbers
FOR i = 1 TO n
LET next = previous + current
REM Add new number to array
FibArray[i] = next
REM Update previous and current values
LET previous = current
LET current = next
NEXT i

REM Print output in a readable format
PRINT "The first " + n + "Fibonacci numbers are: "
FOR i = 1 TO n
    PRINT FibArray[i]
NEXT i
