' This program calculates the factorial of a given number

' Define a variable to store the number
num = 7

' Initialize a variable to store the factorial
factorial = 1

' Loop through each number from 1 to the given number
for i = 1 to num

    ' Multiply the current factorial by the current number
    factorial = factorial * i

    ' Decrease the value of the number by 1
    num = num - 1

next i

' Print the factorial
print "The factorial of " + str(i) + " is " + str(factorial)

' Output:
// The factorial of 7 is 5040
