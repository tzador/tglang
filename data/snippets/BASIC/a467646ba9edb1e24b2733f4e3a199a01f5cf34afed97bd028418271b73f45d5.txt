' This program calculates the sum of numbers
' from 1 to 100 and prints the result.

DIM Result AS INTEGER ' declares the variable to store the result
DIM Counter AS INTEGER ' declares the variable to keep track of the number being added
DIM Total AS INTEGER ' declares the variable to keep track of the running total

REM Initialization
Counter = 1 ' initializes the counter to the first number
Total = 0 ' initializes the total to zero

REM Loop through numbers from 1 to 100
DO WHILE Counter <= 100
  Total = Total + Counter ' adds the number to the running total
  Counter = Counter + 1 ' increments the counter
LOOP

REM Display the result
PRINT "The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: " + STR$(Total)

' Output: 
'
