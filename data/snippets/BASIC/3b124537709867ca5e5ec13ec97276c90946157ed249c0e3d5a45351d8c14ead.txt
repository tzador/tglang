REM This program calculates the factorial of a given number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num      REM Prompts user for input
LET fact = 1                       REM Initializes factorial variable
FOR i = 1 TO num                   REM Loops from 1 to given number
    LET fact = fact * i            REM Multiplies current factorial by current loop value
NEXT i                             REM Continues looping until reaching given number
PRINT "The factorial of "; num; " is "; fact  REM Prints the result
END                                REM Stops the program
