' This is a program that calculates the area of a circle
' Program created by [your name]

' Define constant PI with value 3.14
CONST PI = 3.14

' Prompt user for radius of circle
INPUT "Please enter the radius of the circle: ", r

' Calculate area of circle using formula A = PI * r^2
area = PI * r^2

' Output the calculated area with appropriate formatting
PRINT "The area of the circle with radius " + STR$(r) + " is " + STR$(area)

' Define function to calculate circumference using formula C = 2 * PI * r
FUNCTION calculateCircumference(r)
    circumference = 2 * PI * r ' calculate circumference
    RETURN circumference ' return the calculated value
END FUNCTION

' Call the function and store the result in a variable
circumference = calculateCircumference(r)

' Output the calculated circumference with appropriate formatting
PRINT "The circumference of the circle with radius " + STR$(r) + " is " + STR$(circumference)
