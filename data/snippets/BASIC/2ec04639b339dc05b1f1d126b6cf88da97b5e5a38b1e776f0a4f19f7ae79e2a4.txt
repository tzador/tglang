REM This is a long and complex code snippet in BASIC
REM It calculates the total cost of a shopping list
INPUT "How many items are in your shopping list? "; numItems
REM Initialize variables
LET totalCost = 0
LET numItemsCount = 1
WHILE numItemsCount <= numItems
    REM Get input for item name
    INPUT "Enter the name of item #" + STR$(numItemsCount) + ": "; itemName
    REM Get input for item price
    INPUT "Enter the price of " + itemName + ": "; itemPrice
    REM Calculate total cost
    LET totalCost = totalCost + itemPrice
    LET numItemsCount = numItemsCount + 1
WEND
REM Output the total cost
PRINT "Total cost of shopping list is: " + STR$(totalCost)
