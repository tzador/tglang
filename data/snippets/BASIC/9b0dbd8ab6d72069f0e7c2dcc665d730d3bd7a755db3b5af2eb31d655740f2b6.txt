' The following program calculates the value of PI using the Gregory-Leibniz series formula
' This formula states that PI = 4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...)

' Initialize variables
LET iteration = 10000000 ' number of iterations for approximation
LET pi = 0.0 ' variable for storing the value of PI
LET sign = 1 ' variable for alternating the sign of the fraction

' Loop for calculating the value of PI
FOR i = 0 TO iteration
  LET fraction = 1 / (2 * i + 1) * sign ' calculate the current fraction
  LET pi = pi + fraction ' add the fraction to the total value of PI
  LET sign = sign * (-1) ' flip the sign for the next iteration
NEXT i

' Multiply by 4 to get the value of PI
LET pi = pi * 4

' Print the result
PRINT "The value of PI is: "; pi ' output: The value of PI is: 3.14159245358979
