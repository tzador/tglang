REM This code snippet generates the first 1000 prime numbers in BASIC

DIM N$(999) 'declare an array to store the prime numbers
DIM J%(999) 'declare an array to keep track of whether a number is prime or not
J%(0)=1 'initialize the first element of J% to 1, representing 1 not being prime
J%(1)=1 'initialize the second element of J% to 1, representing 2 not being prime

'loops through all numbers from 3 to 999 and checks for prime status
FOR I = 3 TO 999
    IF J%(I)=0 THEN 'if J% is 0, it means the number is not marked as not prime
        N$(I - 2)=STR$(I) 'store prime number in N$ array
        FOR K = I * I TO 999 STEP I 'loop through multiples of the prime number to mark as not prime
            J%(K)=1 'mark number as not prime
        NEXT K
    END IF
