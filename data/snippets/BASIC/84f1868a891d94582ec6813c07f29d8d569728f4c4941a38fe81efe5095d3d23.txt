REM This is a program that calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function
FUNCTION Factorial(num)
    IF num <= 1 THEN
        Factorial = 1
    ELSE
        Factorial = num * Factorial(num - 1)
    END IF
END FUNCTION

REM Main program
INPUT "Enter a number: ", n
PRINT "The factorial of "; n; " is "; Factorial(n)
