REM This is a comment in BASIC
REM This program calculates the factorial of a given number

INPUT "Enter a number: ", n
REM The user inputs the number to calculate factorial for

factorial = 1
REM Sets the initial value of the factorial to 1

FOR i = 1 TO n
REM Starts a for loop to iterate from 1 to the given number

factorial = factorial * i
REM Multiplies the factorial variable by the current value of i in each iteration

NEXT i
REM Moves on to the next value of i in each iteration

PRINT "The factorial of "; n; "is "; factorial
REM Prints the result of the factorial calculation, including the input number and the final factorial value
