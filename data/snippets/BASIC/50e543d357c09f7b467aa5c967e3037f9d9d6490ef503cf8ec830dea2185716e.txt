' This is a BASIC program that calculates the factorial of a given number

INPUT "Enter a number"; N ' prompt user to enter a number
IF N < 0 THEN ' check if the number is negative
    PRINT "Error: Factorial is only defined for positive integers." ' display error message
ELSE ' if the number is positive
    FACT = 1 ' initialize factorial variable to 1
    FOR I = 1 TO N ' loop from 1 to the given number
        FACT = FACT * I ' multiply factorial variable by loop iteration
    NEXT I ' go to next iteration
    PRINT "The factorial of "; N; " is "; FACT ' display result
END IF ' end if statement

' Sample Output:
' Enter a number: 5
' The factorial of 5 is 120
