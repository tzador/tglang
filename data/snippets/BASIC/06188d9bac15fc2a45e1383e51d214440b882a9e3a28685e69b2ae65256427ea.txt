' This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given term
' Declarations
DIM prevTerm AS INTEGER ' variable for the previous term
DIM curTerm AS INTEGER ' variable for the current term
DIM nextTerm AS INTEGER ' variable for the next term

' Input
INPUT "Enter the number of terms to calculate: ", numTerms

' Initialize the variables with the first two terms of the sequence
prevTerm = 0
curTerm = 1

' Loop to calculate and print the sequence
FOR i = 1 TO numTerms 
    ' Calculate the next term 
    nextTerm = prevTerm + curTerm 

    ' Print the current term
    PRINT curTerm; " " 

    ' Update the variables with the next term
    prevTerm = curTerm 
    curTerm = nextTerm
NEXT i 

' Output
PRINT "The Fibonacci sequence up to "; numTerms; " terms is complete."
