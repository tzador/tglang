' This program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion
INPUT "Enter a number: ", number 'prompts user to input a number
PRINT "The factorial of "; number; " is "; Factorial(number) 'calls the Factorial subroutine and displays result

SUB Factorial(n) 'defines the Factorial subroutine
    IF n <= 1 THEN 'base condition
        Factorial = 1 'returns 1 if input is 0 or 1
    ELSE
        Factorial = n * Factorial(n-1) 'recursively calls the Factorial subroutine with n-1 as input and multiplies it with n
    END IF
END SUB 'ends the Factorial subroutine

' Example:
' Enter a number: 5
' The factorial of 5 is 120
