input "Enter a number to calculate the factorial: ", num ' prompts user to enter a number
factorial = 1 ' initializes the factorial variable to 1
for i = 1 to num ' starts a for loop with i starting at 1 and ending at the entered number
    factorial = factorial * i ' multiplies the current factorial value by the current number (i)
    next i ' moves to the next iteration of the loop
print "The factorial of "; num; " is "; factorial ' outputs the result to the console
end
