REM This program will calculate the factorial of a user-inputted number

INPUT "Enter a number to find its factorial: ", n

REM initialize variables
product = 1
i = 1

REM loop through numbers from 1 to n
FOR count = 1 TO n

    REM multiply the current product by the current number
    product = product * i
    
    REM increment i by 1 for the next loop iteration
    i = i + 1

NEXT count

REM print the factorial of the inputted number 
PRINT "The factorial of "; n; " is "; product
