' This is a complex code snippet in BASIC, used for performing mathematical operations

' Define variables
DIM x, y, z AS INTEGER
DIM result AS REAL
DIM pi AS CONSTANT REAL ' Defining pi as a constant

' Input values for x and y
INPUT "Enter value for x: "; x
INPUT "Enter value for y: "; y

' Perform addition
z = x + y
PRINT "The sum of x and y is: "; z

' Perform subtraction
z = x - y
PRINT "The difference of x and y is: "; z

' Perform multiplication
z = x * y
PRINT "The product of x and y is: "; z

' Perform division
IF y = 0 THEN
    PRINT "Division by zero is not allowed."
ELSE
    result = x / y
    PRINT "The quotient of x and y is: "; result
END IF

' Calculate the area of a circle
INPUT "Enter the radius of the circle: "; r
result = pi * r ^ 2 ' Using the constant pi to calculate the area
PRINT "The area of the circle is: "; result

' Calculate the square root of x
IF x < 0 THEN
    PRINT "Square root of a negative number is not defined."
ELSE
    result = SQR(x)
    PRINT "The square root of x is: "; result
END IF

' Calculate the factorial of y
result = 1
FOR i = 1 TO y ' Using a loop to multiply all numbers from 1 to y
    result = result * i
NEXT i
PRINT "The factorial of y is: "; result
