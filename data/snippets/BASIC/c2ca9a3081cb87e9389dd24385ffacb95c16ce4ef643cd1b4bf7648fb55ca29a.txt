REM This program calculates the sum of the first 10 natural numbers
DIM numbers(10) AS INTEGER 'Declare an array to store the numbers
DIM sum AS INTEGER 'Declare a variable to store the sum

FOR i = 1 TO 10 'Loop through the first 10 natural numbers
    numbers(i) = i 'Assign each number to the corresponding index in the array
    sum = sum + numbers(i) 'Sum up the numbers
NEXT i 'End of loop

PRINT "The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is: " & sum 'Print the result

'Output: `The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is: 55`
