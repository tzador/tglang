REM This is a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.
REM Input: num -- integer value to take factorial of
REM Output: result -- factorial of the input number

INPUT "Enter a number: "; num  ' prompt user for input

REM initialize result variable with value of 1
LET result = 1

REM loop through each number from 1 to the input number
FOR i = 1 TO num
    LET result = result * i  ' multiply current result with current number
NEXT i

REM output the calculated factorial
PRINT "Factorial of "; num; " is "; result  ' semi-colon used for concatenation

END  ' end of program
