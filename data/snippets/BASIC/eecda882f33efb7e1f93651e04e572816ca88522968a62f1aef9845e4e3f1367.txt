REM This program demonstrates nested FOR loops to print a pattern of asterisks and spaces
FOR i = 1 TO 4   REM Loop for 4 rows
FOR j = 1 TO i   REM Loop for varying number of spaces based on row number
PRINT " ";       REM Print a space character
NEXT j           REM End of inner loop
FOR k = 1 TO (4-i) REM Loop for varying number of asterisks based on row number
PRINT "*";        REM Print an asterisk character
NEXT k             REM End of inner loop
PRINT             REM Print a line break after each row
NEXT i             REM End of outer loop
END                REM End the program
