' This program calculates the factorial of a number
' Implemented using iterative approach

' Declaring and initializing variables
DIM number AS INTEGER = 5
DIM factorial AS INTEGER = 1

' Iterative loop for calculating factorial
FOR i = 1 TO number
    factorial = factorial * i
NEXT i

' Output the factorial value
PRINT "Factorial of " + STR$(number) + " is " + STR$(factorial)
