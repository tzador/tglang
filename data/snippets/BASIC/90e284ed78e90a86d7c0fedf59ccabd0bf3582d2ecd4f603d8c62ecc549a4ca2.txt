' This program calculates the average of three numbers

' Declare three variables to store the numbers
DIM num1, num2, num3 AS INTEGER

' Prompt the user to enter the first number
PRINT "Enter the first number:"
INPUT num1

' Prompt the user to enter the second number
PRINT "Enter the second number:"
INPUT num2

' Prompt the user to enter the third number
PRINT "Enter the third number:"
INPUT num3

' Calculate the sum of the three numbers
LET sum = num1 + num2 + num3

' Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 3
LET average = sum / 3.0

'Print the result
PRINT "The average of", num1, num2, "and", num3, "is", average
