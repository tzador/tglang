REM This program calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
INPUT "Enter the value of n: "; n
REM Initialize variables for previous and current term
LET prev = 0
LET curr = 1
REM Check for special cases where n is 1 or 2
IF n = 1 OR n = 2 THEN
    LET term = 1
REM Loop through the sequence to calculate the nth term
FOR i = 3 TO n
    LET term = prev + curr
    LET prev = curr
    LET curr = term
NEXT i
REM Only print the final result
PRINT "The " + STR$(n) + "th term in the Fibonacci sequence is " + STR$(term)
