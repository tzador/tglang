' This program calculates the sum of two numbers
 ' Define two variables to store the numbers
 A = 5
 B = 10

 ' Calculate the sum of the two numbers and store it in a third variable
 C = A + B

 ' Print the result to the screen
 PRINT "The sum of " + A + " and " + B + " is " + C + "."

 ' Generate a random number between 1 and 10 and store it in a variable
 R = INT(RND*10)+1

 ' Use a loop to calculate the factorial of the random number
 FACT = 1
 FOR I = 1 TO R
    FACT = FACT * I
 NEXT I

 ' Print the factorial to the screen
 PRINT "The factorial of " + R + " is " + FACT + "."
