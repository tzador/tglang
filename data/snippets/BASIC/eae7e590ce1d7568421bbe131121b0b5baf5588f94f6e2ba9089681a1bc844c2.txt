' This is a BASIC program that prompts the user to input two values
' and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 

' Define variables
A = 0
B = 0
Result = 0

' Prompt user for input
PRINT "Please enter the first value: ";
INPUT A
PRINT "Please enter the second value: ";
INPUT B

' Perform addition
Result = A + B
PRINT "The sum of " + STR$(A) + " and " + STR$(B) + " is " + STR$(Result)

' Perform subtraction
Result = A - B
PRINT "The result of subtracting " + STR$(B) + " from " + STR$(A) + " is " + STR$(Result)

' Perform multiplication
Result = A * B
PRINT "The product of " + STR$(A) + " and " + STR$(B) + " is " + STR$(Result)

' Perform division
Result = A / B
PRINT "The quotient of dividing " + STR$(A) + " by " + STR$(B) + " is " + STR$(Result)
