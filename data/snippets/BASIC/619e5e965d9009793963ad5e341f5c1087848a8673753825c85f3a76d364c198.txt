' This is a BASIC program that calculates the average of three numbers

' Declare variables
DIM num1 AS INTEGER
DIM num2 AS INTEGER
DIM num3 AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS INTEGER
DIM avg AS REAL

' Take input from user
INPUT "Enter the first number: ", num1
INPUT "Enter the second number: ", num2
INPUT "Enter the third number: ", num3

' Calculate sum of the three numbers
sum = num1 + num2 + num3

' Calculate average
avg = sum / 3

' Print result
PRINT "The average of ", num1, ",", num2, ",", num3, " is ", avg

' End program
