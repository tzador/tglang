REM This code snippet creates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

DIM num AS INTEGER 'Declare variable for input number
DIM fibseq(20) AS INTEGER 'Declare array to store sequence values
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num 'Prompt user for input number
fibseq(0) = 0 'Set first value in sequence to 0
fibseq(1) = 1 'Set second value in sequence to 1

FOR i = 2 TO num - 1 'Start for loop to populate sequence array
fibseq(i) = fibseq(i - 1) + fibseq(i - 2) 'Calculate next value in sequence
NEXT i 'End for loop

FOR i = 0 TO num - 1 'Start for loop to print sequence
PRINT fibseq(i); 'Print value in sequence
IF i < num - 2 THEN 'Check if not at last value in sequence
PRINT ", "; 'Print comma to separate values
ELSE 'If at last value in sequence
PRINT "." 'Print period to end sequence
END IF 'End if statement
NEXT i 'End for loop

END 'End program
