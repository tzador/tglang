' This is a long and complex code snippet, written in the BASIC programming language.

' Here is a multi-line comment.
' 
' This program will first prompt the user to enter a number, then it will
' iterate through a loop, calculating the factorial of that number.
' The factorial will then be printed to the screen.

' First, let's define our variables.
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num ' This line will prompt the user for input and store it in the variable "num".
LET factorial = 1 ' We will use this variable to store the factorial of the input number.

' Now we will begin our loop.
' This loop will repeat the same calculation until the counter variable "i" reaches the value of "num".
FOR i = 1 TO num ' This line sets the starting value of the counter variable "i" to 1, and the ending value to the input number "num".
    LET factorial = factorial * i ' This line will multiply the current value of "factorial" by the current value of "i".
NEXT i ' This marks the end of our loop.

' Finally, we will print the factorial to the screen.
PRINT "The factorial of "; num; " is "; factorial ' This line will print the calculated factorial to the screen.

' This is the end of our program.
