' This code snippet will generate the factorial of a given number
INPUT "Enter a number: "; n  ' prompts user for input
factorial = 1                ' sets the variable for factorial
FOR i = 1 TO n               ' sets a FOR loop from 1 to the given number
  factorial = factorial * i  ' multiplies the factorial variable by each iteration of i
NEXT i                       ' ends the FOR loop
PRINT "The factorial of "; n; " is "; factorial  ' prints the factorial value
END                          ' ends the program
