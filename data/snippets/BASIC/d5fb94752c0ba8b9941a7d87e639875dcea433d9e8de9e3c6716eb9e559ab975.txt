REM This program calculates the gcd of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm

DIM a AS INTEGER 'declare variable to hold first number
DIM b AS INTEGER 'declare variable to hold second number
DIM gcd AS INTEGER 'declare variable to hold result

INPUT "Enter first number: ", a
INPUT "Enter second number: ", b

IF a < b THEN 'swap numbers if a is smaller
    temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
END IF

DO
    r = a MOD b 'calculate remainder
    a = b 'replace first number with second number
    b = r 'replace second number with remainder
LOOP WHILE r > 0

gcd = a 'the gcd is the last non-zero remainder

PRINT "The gcd of the two numbers is: "; gcd 'output result
