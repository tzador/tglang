' This code snippet simulates a simple game called "Guess the Number"
' The player must guess the correct number between 1 and 10

' Declare variables
DIM secretNumber AS INTEGER
DIM guess AS INTEGER
DIM attempts AS INTEGER

' Generate a random number between 1 and 10 as the secret number
RANDOMIZE
secretNumber = INT(RND * 10 + 1)

' Initialize number of attempts
attempts = 1

' Loop until player guesses the correct number
DO
    PRINT "Guess a number between 1 and 10: "
    INPUT guess

    ' Check if guess is within range
    IF guess < 1 OR guess > 10 THEN
        PRINT "Invalid guess. Please try again."

    ' Check if guess is too low
    ELSEIF guess < secretNumber THEN
        PRINT "Your guess is too low. Guess again."
        attempts = attempts + 1

    ' Check if guess is too high
    ELSEIF guess > secretNumber THEN
        PRINT "Your guess is too high. Guess again."
        attempts = attempts + 1

    ' If guess is correct, end loop
    ELSE
        PRINT "Congratulations, you guessed the correct number in " + STR$(attempts) + " attempts!"
        EXIT DO
    END IF
