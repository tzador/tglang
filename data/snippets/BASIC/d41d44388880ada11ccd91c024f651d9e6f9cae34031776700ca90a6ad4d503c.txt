REM This program calculates the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 100
REM Initialize the variables
DIM i AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS INTEGER
REM Set sum to 0
sum = 0
REM Loop through all numbers from 1 to 100
FOR i = 1 TO 100
    REM Check if the number is odd
    IF i MOD 2 = 1 THEN
        REM Add the number to the sum
        sum = sum + i
    END IF
NEXT i
REM Print the result
PRINT "The sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 100 is: " + STR$(sum)
