' This code generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
' Input the number of terms for the sequence
INPUT "Enter the number of terms: ", n
' Set initial values for the first two terms of the sequence
LET term1 = 0
LET term2 = 1
PRINT term1 ' Output the first term
PRINT term2 ' Output the second term
' Use a loop to generate the remaining terms
FOR i = 3 TO n
    LET term3 = term1 + term2 ' Calculate the next term in the sequence
    PRINT term3 ' Output the next term
    ' Shift the previous terms to generate the next one
    LET term1 = term2
    LET term2 = term3
NEXT i
END ' End program execution
