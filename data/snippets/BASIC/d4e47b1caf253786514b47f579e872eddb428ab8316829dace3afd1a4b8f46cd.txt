REM This code snippet generates a basic world map using nested for loops.
DIM map(20, 40) 'Specify the size of the map in cells

FOR x = 1 TO 20 'Loop through the x-axis cells
    FOR y = 1 TO 40 'Loop through the y-axis cells
        c = RND(1) 'Generate a random number between 0 and 1
        IF c < 0.1 THEN '10% chance of cell being a mountain
            map(x, y) = "M" 'Mark cell as mountain
        ELSEIF c < 0.3 THEN '20% chance of cell being a forest
            map(x, y) = "F" 'Mark cell as forest
        ELSEIF c < 0.5 THEN '20% chance of cell being a river
            map(x, y) = "R" 'Mark cell as river
        ELSEIF c < 0.8 THEN '30% chance of cell being grassland
            map(x, y) = "G" 'Mark cell as grassland
        ELSE '20% chance of cell being desert
            map(x, y) = "D" 'Mark cell as desert
        END IF
    NEXT y
NEXT x

REM Print the generated map
