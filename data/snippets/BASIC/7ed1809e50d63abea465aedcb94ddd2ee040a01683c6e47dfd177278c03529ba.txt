INPUT "Enter the base length: ", base
REM Check if base is a positive number
IF base <= 0 THEN PRINT "Base length must be a positive number": END
INPUT "Enter the height: ", height
REM Check if height is a positive number
IF height <= 0 THEN PRINT "Height must be a positive number": END
REM Calculate the area
LET area = 0.5 * base * height
REM Print the result
PRINT "The area of the triangle is";
PRINT area;
