' This is a complex code snippet in BASIC
' It generates a random number between 1 to 10
RANDOMIZE TIMER ' initialize the random number generator with system clock
DIM a(10) ' create an array with 10 elements
FOR i = 1 TO 10 ' loop 10 times
    RANDOM a(i) ' generate a random number and assign it to the ith element in the array
NEXT i ' end loop
FOR i = 1 TO 10 ' loop 10 times
    PRINT a(i) ' print the random number stored in the ith element of the array
NEXT i ' end loop
END ' end program
