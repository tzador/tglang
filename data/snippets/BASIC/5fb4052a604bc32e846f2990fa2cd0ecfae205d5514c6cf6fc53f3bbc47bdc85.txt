REM This program generates a random number and checks if it is odd or even

'initialize variables
DIM random AS INTEGER
DIM even AS INTEGER
DIM odd AS INTEGER
DIM num AS STRING

'generate random number between 1 and 1000

'print the random number and its classification
PRINT "The random number is " + STR$(random) + " and its classification is " + num
