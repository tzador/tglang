REM CALCULATING THE AVERAGE
LET sum = 0			REM initializing the sum variable
LET count = 0			REM initializing the count variable

FOR i = 1 TO 10		REM loop from 1 to 10
	INPUT num		REM ask for input
	sum = sum + num		REM add input to sum
	count = count + 1		REM increase count by 1
	NEXT i			REM end loop

LET average = sum / count	REM calculate average

PRINT "The average is: "; average		REM output average
