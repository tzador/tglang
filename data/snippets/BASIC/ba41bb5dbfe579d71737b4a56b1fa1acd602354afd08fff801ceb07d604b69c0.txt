    'This program demonstrates basic math functions in BASIC
    'Variables
    LET a = 5
    LET b = 2
    'Basic addition operation
    LET c = a + b
    PRINT "The sum of a and b is " + c
    'Basic subtraction operation
    LET d = a - b
    PRINT "The difference of a and b is " + d
    'Basic multiplication operation
    LET e = a * b
    PRINT "The product of a and b is " + e
    'Basic division operation
    LET f = a / b
    PRINT "The quotient of a and b is " + f
    'Modulo operation
    LET g = a % b
    PRINT "The remainder of a divided by b is " + g
    'Power function
    LET h = a ^ b
    PRINT "The result of a to the power of b is " + h
