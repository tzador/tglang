REM This code snippet generates a multiplication table from 1 to 10

REM Set up for loop to iterate from 1 to 10 for the first number
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    REM Set up for loop to iterate from 1 to 10 for the second number
    FOR j = 1 TO 10
        REM Multiply the two numbers and print the result
        result = i * j
        PRINT USING "###"; i;
        PRINT " x "; j;
        PRINT " = "; result;
    NEXT j

    REM Add a new line after each row
    PRINT
NEXT i
