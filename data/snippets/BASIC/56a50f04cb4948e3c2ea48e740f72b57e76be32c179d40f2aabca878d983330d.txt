REM This code calculates the average of an array of numbers

DIM num(10) AS INTEGER       Rem Declaring an array of 10 integers
DIM sum AS INTEGER           Rem Declaring a variable to store sum of array elements
DIM avg AS INTEGER           Rem Declaring a variable to store average
DIM i AS INTEGER             Rem Declaring a loop control variable

FOR i = 1 TO 10              Rem Loop from 1 to 10
    num(i) = INT(RND * 100)  Rem Assigning random numbers to array elements
    PRINT num(i)             Rem Printing each element for verification
    sum = sum + num(i)       Rem Adding each element to sum variable
NEXT i                       Rem End of loop

avg = sum / 10               Rem Calculating average by dividing sum by number of elements
PRINT "The average is: "; avg Rem Printing the result

END                          Rem End of program
