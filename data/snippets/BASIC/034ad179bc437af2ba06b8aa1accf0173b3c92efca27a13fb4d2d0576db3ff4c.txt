REM This code snippet is a basic calculator program in BASIC.

REM Declaration of variables
DIM num1 AS INTEGER
DIM num2 AS INTEGER
DIM operator AS STRING
DIM result AS DOUBLE

REM Input two numbers and operator from user
INPUT "Enter first number: ", num1
INPUT "Enter second number: ", num2
INPUT "Enter operator (+, -, *, /): ", operator

REM Calculation based on operator
IF operator = "+" THEN
    result = num1 + num2
ELSE IF operator = "-" THEN
    result = num1 - num2
ELSE IF operator = "*" THEN
    result = num1 * num2
ELSE IF operator = "/" THEN
    result = num1 / num2
ELSE
    REM Error message for invalid operator input
    PRINT "Invalid operator input"
END IF

REM Output the result
PRINT "Result: " & result

REM End of program
END
