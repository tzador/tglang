#This code snippet uses arrays and loops to generate a Fibonacci sequence.
#The first two terms of the sequence are taken as user input.
#The sequence is then printed in a formatted list.

#Function to generate Fibonacci sequence
DEF FNfib(a,b)
DIM seq$(10) #Declare string array to store sequence
seq$(1)=STR$(a) #Assign first term to array
seq$(2)=STR$(b) #Assign second term to array
n=3 #Counter for array index
c=a+b #Calculate next term
WHILE c<=1000 #Loop till next term is less than or equal to 1000
  seq$(n)=STR$(c) #Assign next term to array
  a=b #Shift terms
  b=c
  c=a+b #Calculate next term
  n=n+1 #Increment counter
WEND

#User input for first two terms
INPUT "Enter first term:"; f
INPUT "Enter second term:"; s

#Print sequence in formatted list
PRINT "The Fibonacci sequence starting with ";f;" and ";s;" is:"
FOR i=1 TO n-1 #Loop through array
  PRINT seq$(i);", "; #Print term and comma
NEXT i
PRINT seq$(n) #Print last term without comma
