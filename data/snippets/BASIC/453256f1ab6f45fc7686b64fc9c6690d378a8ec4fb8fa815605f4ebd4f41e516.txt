REM This program will prompt the user to enter a number and
REM then calculate the square root of that number.
REM Afterwards, the result will be printed to the screen.
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num  ' Prompts the user to enter a number and stores it in the variable "num"
LET result = SQR(num)  ' Calculates the square root of the number and stores it in the variable "result"
PRINT "The square root of "; num; " is "; result  ' Prints the result to the screen
REM Can also be done in one line:
REM PRINT "The square root of "; INPUT "Enter a number: ", num; " is "; SQR(num)
END  ' Ends the program
