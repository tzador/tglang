' This program calculates the average of 10 input numbers and outputs the result
' Define variables
DIM input(10) AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS INTEGER
DIM average AS REAL

' Prompt user for input
PRINT "Please enter 10 numbers to calculate their average:"

' Loop through input and add to sum variable
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    READ input(i)
    sum = sum + input(i)
NEXT i

' Calculate average
average = sum / 10

' Output result
PRINT "The average of the 10 numbers is: ", average

' Data for input
DATA 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50
