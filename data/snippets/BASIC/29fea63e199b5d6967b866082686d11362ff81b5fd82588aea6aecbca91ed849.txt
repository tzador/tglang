' This code snippet calculates the sum of the first 10 even numbers
DIM num(10) ' Declare array to store even numbers
sum = 0 ' Initialize sum variable
FOR i = 1 TO 10 ' Loop 10 times
    num(i) = 2 * i ' Calculate even number and store in array
    sum = sum + num(i) ' Add even number to sum
NEXT i ' End loop
PRINT "The sum of the first 10 even numbers is "; sum ' Output sum
