REM This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number
REM and outputs it to the console

REM Function to calculate the factorial
DEF FN FACT(n)
    REM Initialize result variable
    LET result = 1
    REM Loop from 1 to n 
    FOR i=1 TO n
        REM Multiply current number with result
        LET result = result * i
    NEXT i
    REM Return the result
    RETURN result
END DEF

REM Prompt user to enter a number
INPUT "Enter a number: "; number

REM Call the factorial function and store the result
LET factorial = FN FACT(number)

REM Output the result to the console
PRINT "Factorial of "; number; " is: "; factorial
