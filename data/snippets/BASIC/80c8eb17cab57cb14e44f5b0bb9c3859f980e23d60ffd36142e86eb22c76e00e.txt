REM This is a program to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to n
LET n = 10        REM n is the upper limit of the integer range
DIM sum AS INTEGER    REM declare an integer variable sum to store the sum
FOR i = 1 TO n       REM start a for loop from 1 to n
    LET sum = sum + i       REM add i to the current sum
NEXT i      REM end the loop
PRINT "The sum of all integers from 1 to " + STR$(n) + " is " + STR$(sum)     REM print the result
END     REM end the program
