REM Get user input
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num

REM Initialize variables
LET fact = 1
LET i = 1

REM Loop through numbers from 1 to num
FOR i = 1 TO num

REM Calculate factorial
LET fact = fact * i

NEXT i

REM Print result to the screen
PRINT "The factorial of "; num; " is "; fact

REM End of program
