REM This is a basic program that uses loops and conditional statements

REM Declare variables and initialize them
DIM i AS INTEGER
DIM j AS INTEGER
i = 1
j = 10

REM Create a for loop that will iterate through numbers 1 to 10
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    REM Check if i is divisible by 2
    IF i MOD 2 = 0 THEN
        PRINT "The number" ; i ; "is even"
    ELSE
        PRINT "The number" ; i ; "is odd"
    END IF

    REM Create a while loop that will decrement j until it reaches 5
    WHILE j > 5
        PRINT "The value of j is" ; j
        j = j - 1
    WEND

    REM Check if i is equal to 3 or 7
    IF i = 3 OR i = 7 THEN
        PRINT "i is either 3 or 7"
    ELSEIF i = 4 THEN
        PRINT "i is equal to 4"
    ELSE
        PRINT "i is not equal to 3, 4, or 7"
    END IF
NEXT i

REM Create a subroutine that will calculate the sum of two numbers
SUB sum(a, b)
    PRINT "The sum of" ; a ; "and" ; b ; "is" ; a + b
END SUB

REM Call the subroutine with different values
sum(2, 4)
sum(8, 10)
sum(6, 12)
