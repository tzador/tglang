' This program implements a basic calculator in BASIC language
' that takes two numbers and performs arithmetic operations on them
' Declare variables to store input numbers and result
DIM num1, num2, result AS INTEGER

' Prompt user to enter first number
PRINT "Enter first number:"

' Accept user input and store in num1 variable
INPUT num1

' Prompt user to enter second number
PRINT "Enter second number:"

' Accept user input and store in num2 variable
INPUT num2

' Perform addition operation and store result in result variable
result = num1 + num2

' Print result to console
PRINT "The sum of ", num1, " and ", num2, " is ", result

' Perform subtraction operation and store result in result variable
result = num1 - num2

' Print result to console
PRINT "The difference between ", num1, " and ", num2, " is ", result

' Perform multiplication operation and store result in result variable
result = num1 * num2

' Print result to console
PRINT "The product of ", num1, " and ", num2, " is ", result

' Perform division operation and store result in result variable
result = num1 / num2

' Print result to console
PRINT "The quotient of ", num1, " and ", num2, " is ", result

' Clear all variables from memory
CLEAR
