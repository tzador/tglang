REM This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci sequence
DIM result(20) AS INTEGER
result(0) = 0
result(1) = 1

REM Populate the array with the Fibonacci numbers
FOR i = 2 TO 20
    result(i) = result(i-1) + result(i-2)
NEXT i

REM Print the result to the screen
PRINT "The first 20 Fibonacci numbers are:"
FOR i = 0 TO 19
    PRINT result(i)
NEXT i
