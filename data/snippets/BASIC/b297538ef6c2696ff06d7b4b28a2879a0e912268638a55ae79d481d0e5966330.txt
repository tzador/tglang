REM This is a Basic code snippet for a simple calculator program
REM It takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations
REM The result is then printed on the screen

INPUT "Enter first number: "; num1
INPUT "Enter second number: "; num2

REM Addition
LET result = num1 + num2
PRINT "The sum of ", num1, " and ", num2, " is ", result

REM Subtraction
LET result = num1 - num2
PRINT "The difference of ", num1, " and ", num2, " is ", result

REM Multiplication
LET result = num1 * num2
PRINT "The product of ", num1, " and ", num2, " is ", result

REM Division
LET result = num1 / num2
PRINT "The quotient of ", num1, " and ", num2, " is ", result

REM Modulo
LET result = num1 MOD num2
PRINT "The remainder when ", num1, " is divided by ", num2, " is ", result
