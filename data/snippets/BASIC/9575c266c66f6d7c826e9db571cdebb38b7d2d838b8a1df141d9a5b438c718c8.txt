REM This is a snippet that creates a multi-dimensional array and fills it with random integers
DIM arr(10,10) 'Declare a 2-dimensional array with 10 rows and 10 columns

FOR i = 1 TO 10 'Loop through the rows
    FOR j = 1 TO 10 'Loop through the columns
        CALL randomize 'Seed the random number generator
        arr(i, j) = INT(RND * 100) 'Fill the array with a random integer between 0 and 100
    NEXT j 'End of inner loop
NEXT i 'End of outer loop

FOR i = 1 TO 10 'Loop through the rows
    FOR j = 1 TO 10 'Loop through the columns
        PRINT arr(i, j); 'Print the value at each index
    NEXT j 'End of inner loop
    PRINT 'Print a new line for each row
NEXT i 'End of outer loop
