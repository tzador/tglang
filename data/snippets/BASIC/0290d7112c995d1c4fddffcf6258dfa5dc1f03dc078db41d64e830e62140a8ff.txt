' This program takes two numbers as input and finds their average.

' Defining variables
num1 = INPUT "Enter first number: "
num2 = INPUT "Enter second number: "
average = (num1 + num2) / 2

' Outputting result
PRINT "The average of", num1, "and", num2, "is", average

' Function to calculate the average
DEF FNaverage(num1, num2)
  sum = num1 + num2
  average = sum / 2
  PRINT "The average of", num1, "and", num2, "is", average
END DEF
