REM The following program calculates the sum of numbers in a given range
REM Initialize variables
LET start = 1  \* Input the starting number *\
LET end = 10    \* Input the ending number *\
LET sum = 0     \* Variable to store the sum *\
REM Loop through the range
FOR i = start TO end
  LET sum = sum + i  \* Add current number to sum *\
NEXT i
PRINT "The sum of numbers from " + start + " to " + end + " is: " + sum \* Output the sum *\
