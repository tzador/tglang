' This is a BASIC program that calculates the factorial of a given number
' Note: This program assumes the input is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1

INPUT "Enter a number: ", x ' Prompts the user to input a number and stores it in the variable x
factorial = 1 ' Initializes the factorial variable to 1
FOR i = x TO 1 STEP -1 ' Loops through the numbers from x to 1 in descending order
  factorial = factorial * i ' Multiplies the current value of factorial with the current number
NEXT i ' Moves on to the next number in the loop
PRINT "Factorial of "; x; " is "; factorial ' Prints the output in the format "Factorial of x is factorial"

' Example:
' If the user inputs 5, the output will be "Factorial of 5 is 120"
' This is because 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
' Note: BASIC does not support the use of recursion, so a traditional for loop is used instead
