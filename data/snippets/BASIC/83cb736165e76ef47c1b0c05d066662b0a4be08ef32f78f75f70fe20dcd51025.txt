REM This is a complex code snippet in BASIC language.
REM It creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given integer.
REM The function takes in one argument, the number whose factorial is to be calculated.

DEF FN factorial(n)
    REM Check if the number is 0 or 1, return 1
    IF n = 0 OR n = 1 THEN
        RETURN 1
    END IF

    REM Initialize a variable to store the factorial value
    LET fact = 1

    REM Loop through each number from 2 to n
    FOR i = 2 TO n
        REM Multiply current factorial value with the current number
        LET fact = fact * i
    NEXT i

    REM Return the factorial value
    RETURN fact

    REM This is the end of the function
