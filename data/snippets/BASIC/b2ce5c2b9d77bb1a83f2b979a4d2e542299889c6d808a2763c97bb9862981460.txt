'''
    Program to calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100.

    First, we initialize the variables needed for our program.
    'sum' will hold the final sum of all the even numbers.
    'count' will be used in our loop to keep track of the current number.
    'maximum' will be used as the upper limit for our range of numbers.

    It is important to note that in BASIC, variables must be declared
    before they are used. Hence, we use the DIM statement to declare
    our variables.

    We set the maximum limit to 100 and initialize our 'sum' variable to 0.

' Declare variables
DIM sum, count, maximum

' Set maximum limit
maximum = 100

' Initialize 'sum' variable to 0
sum = 0

' Loop from 1 to maximum value, incrementing by 1 each time
FOR count = 1 TO maximum

    ' Check if 'count' is an even number
    IF count MOD 2 = 0 THEN

        ' Add 'count' to 'sum'
        sum = sum + count
    END IF
NEXT count

' Display the final sum of even numbers
PRINT "Sum of even numbers from 1 to 100 is "; sum
