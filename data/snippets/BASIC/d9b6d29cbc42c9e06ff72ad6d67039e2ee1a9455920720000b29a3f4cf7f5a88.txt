' This is a program to find the sum of all numbers in a list
' The list and the sum will be displayed in the console

' Initialization of variables
sum:= 0 ' Variable to store the sum
counter:= 0 ' Variable to keep track of the loop iterations
numbers:= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ' List of numbers to be added, can be changed

' Loop to iterate through the list and add numbers to the sum
FOR i = 1 TO LEN(numbers)
    sum = sum + numbers[i] ' Adding each number to the sum
    counter = counter + 1 ' Incrementing the counter
NEXT i ' End of loop

' Displaying the results in the console
PRINT "List of Numbers: " + STR$(numbers) ' Converting the list to string for display
PRINT "Sum of Numbers: " + STR$(sum) ' Converting the sum to string for display
