' This is a BASIC code snippet that calculates the area of a circle
' Inputs: radius (r)
' Output: area (A)

' Define variables
DIM r AS FLOAT
DIM A AS FLOAT
DIM PI AS FLOAT
PI = 3.14159

' Get user input for radius
INPUT "Enter the radius: ", r

' Calculate area using formula: A = PI * r^2
A = PI * r ^ 2

' Print the result
PRINT "The area of the circle with radius " + STR$(r) + " is " + STR$(A)
