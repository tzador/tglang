`This program will calculate and print the average age of a group
`of people based on their individual ages input by the user.

`Initialize variables
DIM numPeople AS INTEGER
DIM totalAge AS INTEGER
DIM avgAge AS REAL

`Prompt user for number of people
PRINT "Enter the number of people: "
INPUT numPeople

`Use a loop to get individual ages for each person and add them to totalAge
FOR i = 1 TO numPeople
    PRINT "Enter age for person", i, ": "
    INPUT age
    totalAge = totalAge + age
NEXT i

`Calculate average age
avgAge = totalAge / numPeople

`Print the average age with appropriate formatting
PRINT "The average age of the group is: ", USING "##.##", avgAge

`END program
