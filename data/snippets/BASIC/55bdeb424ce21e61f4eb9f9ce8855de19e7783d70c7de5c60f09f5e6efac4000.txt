' this program calculates the factorial of a number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", n ' prompt user for input
fact = 1 ' set initial factorial value
IF n = 0 THEN  ' check if input is 0
    PRINT "Factorial is 1." ' if so, print result and end program
    END
END IF
FOR i = 1 TO n ' loop from 1 to input number
    fact = fact * i ' multiply factorial by current number
NEXT i ' move to next number in loop
PRINT "Factorial of " + n + " is " + fact ' print final result
