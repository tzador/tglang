' This program finds the average of three numbers
' Define three variables for the numbers
DIM num1 AS INTEGER
DIM num2 AS INTEGER
DIM num3 AS INTEGER

' Ask the user to enter the three numbers
PRINT "Enter the first number:"
INPUT num1
PRINT "Enter the second number:"
INPUT num2
PRINT "Enter the third number:"
INPUT num3

' Calculate the sum of the three numbers
DIM sum AS INTEGER
sum = num1 + num2 + num3

' Calculate the average
DIM avg AS INTEGER
avg = sum/3

' Display the average to the user
PRINT "The average of the three numbers is:"
PRINT avg
