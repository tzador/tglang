REM This code snippet uses a FOR loop to calculate the factorial of a given number

INPUT "Enter a number: ", num  'prompt user to input a number
factorial = 1                 'initialize factorial variable
FOR i = num TO 1 STEP -1       'start FOR loop, counting down from input number to 1
    factorial = factorial * i 'multiply factorial by current number in loop
NEXT i                         'end FOR loop
PRINT "The factorial of"; num; "is"; factorial  'display result to user
END                            'end program
