' This is a complex BASIC code snippet that uses arrays and loops to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10
DIM Numbers(10) ' Define an array to store the numbers
FOR i = 1 TO 10 ' Loop through the numbers 1 to 10
  Numbers(i) = i ' Store the current number in the array
NEXT i ' End of loop

DIM Sum ' Define a variable to store the sum
FOR i = 1 TO 10 ' Loop through the numbers 1 to 10 again
  Sum = Sum + Numbers(i) ' Add the current number to the sum
NEXT i ' End of loop

PRINT "The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is: " + Sum ' Print the result
