' This code snippet is a BASIC program that prints out the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.'

' Initialize the variables for the first two terms of the sequence'
a = 0 
b = 1 

' Print the first two terms'
PRINT a 
PRINT b 

' Loop through the remaining terms'
for i = 2 TO 10 
    ' Calculate the next term in the sequence by adding the previous two terms'
    c = a + b 
    ' Print the next term'
    PRINT c 
    ' Shift the variables to the next terms'
    a = b 
    b = c 
NEXT 

' Output:
' 0
' 1
' 1
' 2
' 3
' 5
' 8
' 13
' 21
' 34
' 55
