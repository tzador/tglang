' This program calculates the unknown side of a right triangle using the Pythagorean Theorem
' Define variables for the known sides and unknown side
a = 3 ' Length of first known side
b = 4 ' Length of second known side
c = 0 ' Unknown side, to be calculated

' Calculate the square of each known side
a_squared = a * a
b_squared = b * b

' Calculate the sum of the squares of the known sides
sum_of_squares = a_squared + b_squared

' Take the square root to find the unknown side
c = sqr(sum_of_squares)

' Print the result
print "The unknown side is: "; c

' Bonus: round the result to two decimal places
rounded_c = int(c * 100 + 0.5) / 100.0 ' Multiply by 100 to move decimal point two places to the right, round to nearest integer, then divide by 100 to move decimal point back
print "The unknown side is approximately: "; rounded_c
