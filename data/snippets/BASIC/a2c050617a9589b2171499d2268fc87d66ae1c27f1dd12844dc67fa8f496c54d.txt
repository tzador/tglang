REM This is a program that calculates the factorial of a given number

INPUT "Enter a number: ", n
REM Check if number is positive
IF n <= 0 THEN
    PRINT "Invalid input. Number must be positive."
ELSE
    REM Initialize factorial variable
    fact = 1
    REM Loop from n down to 1
    FOR i = n TO 1 STEP -1
        REM Multiply current number with factorial variable
        fact = fact * i
    NEXT i
    REM Print result
    PRINT "The factorial of "; n; " is "; fact
