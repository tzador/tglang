' This is a complex BASIC code snippet that generates a random
' number between 1 and 10 and adds it to the current value of a variable.

' First, we need to declare our variable and set its initial value to 0.
10 LET sum = 0

' Next, we use the RND function to generate a random number between 1 and 10.
20 LET num = INT(RND * 10) + 1

' We then add the randomly generated number to our sum variable and update its value.
30 LET sum = sum + num

' To ensure our program doesn't end, we use a loop to repeat the process 10 times.
40 FOR i = 1 TO 10
' We use the PRINT command to display the current value of the sum variable.
50 PRINT "Current sum: " + STR$(sum)
' We then generate a new random number and add it to the sum variable.
60 LET num = INT(RND * 10) + 1
70 LET sum = sum + num
' We use a PAUSE statement to pause the program for 1 second before repeating the loop.
80 PAUSE 1000
40 NEXT i

' Finally, we print the final sum value.
90 PRINT "Final sum: " + STR$(sum)

' The program ends here.
END
