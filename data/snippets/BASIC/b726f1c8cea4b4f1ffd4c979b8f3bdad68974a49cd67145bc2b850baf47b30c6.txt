'This code snippet calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

'Function to calculate Fibonacci sequence
DEF FIB(n)  
    'Define variables
    DIM F(n) 'array to store numbers in sequence
    F(0) = 0 'first number in sequence = 0
    F(1) = 1 'second number in sequence = 1

    'Loop through remaining numbers in sequence
    FOR i = 2 TO n  
        F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2)  'formula for Fibonacci sequence
    NEXT i  

    'Print the sequence
    FOR i = 0 TO n  
        PRINT F(i)
