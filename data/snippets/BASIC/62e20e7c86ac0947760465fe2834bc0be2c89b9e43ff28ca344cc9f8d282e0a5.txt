' This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function
' Input: num - The number whose factorial is to be calculated
' Output: The factorial of the given number

FUNCTION factorial(num)

    IF num = 0 THEN ' Base case - If num is 0, return 1
        RETURN 1
    ELSE ' Recursive case - Calculate factorial of num-1 and multiply by num
        RETURN factorial(num-1) * num
    END IF
END FUNCTION

' Example: Calculating the factorial of 5
PRINT "Factorial of 5 is " + STR$(factorial(5)) ' Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
