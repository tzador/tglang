REM This program calculates the square root of a given number

INPUT "Enter a number to find the square root of: "; inputNum

REM check for negative input
IF inputNum < 0 THEN
    PRINT "Invalid input. Cannot find square root of a negative number."
    END
ELSE

REM initialize variables
LET prevGuess = inputNum + 1
LET guess = inputNum / 2
LET num_iterations = 0

REM loop until guess is accurate to within 0.000001
WHILE ABS(guess - prevGuess) > 0.000001 DO
    LET prevGuess = guess

    REM calculate new guess using the Babylonian method
    LET quotient = inputNum / guess
    LET guess = (quotient + guess) / 2

    LET num_iterations = num_iterations + 1

    REM check for infinite loop (if guess never converges)
    IF num_iterations >= 1000 THEN
        PRINT "Error: Calculation may have resulted in an infinite loop."
        END
    END IF
END WHILE

REM print the final estimate of the square root
PRINT "The square root of " + inputNum + " is " + guess
