' An example of a complex BASIC program
' This program calculates the sum of a series of numbers using a for loop

' Initialize the total variable to store the sum
total = 0 

' Get input from user for the number of terms in the series
INPUT "Enter the number of terms: ", num_terms 

' Use a for loop to iterate through the series
FOR i = 1 TO num_terms 

' Get input from user for each term in the series
INPUT "Enter term "; i; ": ", term 

' Add the term to the total
total = total + term 

NEXT i ' End of for loop

' Print the final sum
PRINT "The sum of the series is: "; total

' Example input and output:
' Enter the number of terms: 5
' Enter term 1: 2
' Enter term 2: 5
' Enter term 3: -3
' Enter term 4: 7
' Enter term 5: 1
' The sum of the series is: 12
