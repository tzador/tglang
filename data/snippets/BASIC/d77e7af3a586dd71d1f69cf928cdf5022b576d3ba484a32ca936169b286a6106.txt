' Function to calculate factorial of a number

factorial(n) ' Function to calculate factorial of a number
d = 1 ' Initialize d to 1 (initial value of factorial of a number)
FOR i = 1 TO n ' Loop from 1 to n, incrementing by 1
    d = d * i ' Multiply d by i (i.e. calculate new value of factorial of a number)
NEXT i
PRINT "Factorial of "; n; " is "; d ' Output final result
END ' End of program
