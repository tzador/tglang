40 PRINT "Let's play a game."
50 PRINT "I'm going to think of a number between 1 and 10."
60 PRINT "Can you guess what it is?"
70 INPUT B  // Gets the user's guess and stores it in a variable
80 R = INT(RND(1)*10+1)  // Generates a random number between 1 and 10 and stores it in a variable
90 IF B = R THEN GOTO 120  // If the user's guess is correct, go to line 120
100 PRINT "Sorry, that's not the number. Try again."
110 GOTO 70  // If the user's guess is incorrect, go back to line 70 to prompt another guess
120 PRINT "Congratulations, "; A$; "! You guessed the number correctly.";  // If the user's guess is correct, print a congratulatory message
