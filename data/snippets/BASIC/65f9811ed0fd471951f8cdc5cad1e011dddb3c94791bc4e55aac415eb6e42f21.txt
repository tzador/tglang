# This is a program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number

REM Define the maximum number to calculate the sequence
DIM maxNumber AS INTEGER

REM Define variables to store the sequence
DIM previousNumber AS INTEGER
DIM currentNumber AS INTEGER
DIM nextNumber AS INTEGER

REM Prompt user for input and validate it
INPUT "Enter the maximum number to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to: ", maxNumber
IF maxNumber <= 0 THEN
    PRINT "Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer."
    END
END IF

REM Initialize variables with starting sequence numbers
previousNumber = 0
currentNumber = 1

REM Display starting sequence numbers
PRINT "Fibonacci sequence up to", maxNumber
PRINT previousNumber
PRINT currentNumber

REM Loop through the sequence, calculating next number and displaying it
WHILE currentNumber < maxNumber
    nextNumber = previousNumber + currentNumber
    PRINT nextNumber
    previousNumber = currentNumber
    currentNumber = nextNumber
END WHILE
