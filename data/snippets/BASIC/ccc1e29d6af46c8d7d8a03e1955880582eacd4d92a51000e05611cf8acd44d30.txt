' This is a program written in BASIC that calculates the cosine of a given angle

' Define variables for storing angle and cosine
LET angle = 45
LET cosine = 0

' Iterate through a loop to find the cosine of the angle
FOR i = 0 TO 10
    LET term = ((-1)^i * angle^(2 * i)) / (2 * i)!
    LET cosine = cosine + term
NEXT i

' Print the calculated cosine
PRINT "The cosine of angle " + angle + " is " + cosine

' Function to calculate factorial of a given number
FUNCTION factorial(x)
    IF x = 0 THEN RETURN 1
    RETURN x * factorial(x - 1)
END FUNCTION
