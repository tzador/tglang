REM This is a complex snippet in BASIC
10 LET x = 5
20 LET y = 3
30 LET z = 0

REM Initializing counters
40 LET i = 1
50 LET j = 1
60 LET k = 1

REM Start of nested FOR loops
70 FOR i = 1 TO x
80 FOR j = 1 TO y
90 FOR k = 1 TO z

REM Printing values of i, j, and k
100 PRINT "i = "; i
110 PRINT "j = "; j
120 PRINT "k = "; k

REM Calculating the sum of i, j, and k
130 LET sum = i + j + k

REM Checking if sum is divisible by 3
140 IF sum MOD 3 = 0 THEN
150 PRINT "Sum is divisible by 3"
160 ELSE
170 PRINT "Sum is not divisible by 3"
180 END IF

REM End of nested FOR loops
190 NEXT k
200 NEXT j
210 NEXT i
