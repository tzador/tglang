REM The following code snippet will calculate the factorial of a given number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", num      ' take input from user and store in variable num
FACT = 1                           ' initialize a variable to store factorial value
FOR i = 1 TO num                   ' start a for loop from 1 to the entered number
    FACT = FACT * i                ' multiply current factorial value with loop iteration
NEXT i                             ' finish the for loop
PRINT "The factorial of "; num; " is "; FACT       ' print the result with an appropriate message
END                                ' end the program
