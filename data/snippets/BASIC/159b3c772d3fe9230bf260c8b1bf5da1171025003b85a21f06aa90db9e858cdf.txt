REM Function to check if a number is prime
function isPrime(num)
   REM check if num is less than 2
   if num < 2 then
      REM num is not prime
      return false
   REM create a variable to store the multiple
   dim multiple
   REM loop through numbers from 2 to num-1
   for multiple=2 to num-1
      REM check if num is divisible by this multiple
      if num mod multiple = 0 then
         REM num is not prime
         return false
      end if
   next multiple
   REM num is prime
   return true
