' This subroutine uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of a given number.
' It takes in one parameter, n, which is the given number.
' The result is stored in the variable "factorial".

DIM factorial AS INTEGER  ' declare a variable to store the factorial value
factorial = 1  ' initialize the variable with 1

INPUT "Enter a number: ", n  ' prompt the user to enter a number

' calculate the factorial of the given number using a for loop
FOR i = 1 TO n
    factorial = factorial * i  ' multiply the factorial variable by the loop counter
NEXT i

PRINT "Factorial of "; n; " is "; factorial  ' print the result to the user

END  ' end the subroutine
