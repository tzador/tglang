***Basic program to find the nth Fibonacci number***
REM Define variables
DIM n AS INTEGER
DIM fib AS INTEGER
DIM fib_prev AS INTEGER
DIM fib_next AS INTEGER

REM Take input from user
INPUT "Enter the value of n: ", n

REM Initialize variables
fib_prev = 0
fib_next = 1
fib = 0

REM Calculate nth Fibonacci number using loop
FOR i = 1 TO n
    fib = fib_prev + fib_next
    fib_prev = fib_next
    fib_next = fib
NEXT i

REM Output result
PRINT "The " + n + "th Fibonacci number is " + fib
