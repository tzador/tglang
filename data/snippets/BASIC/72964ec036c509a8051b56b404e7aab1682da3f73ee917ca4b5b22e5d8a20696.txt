' Example code snippet in BASIC

' Declare and initialize variables
DIM count AS INTEGER = 1
DIM total AS DOUBLE = 0
DIM average AS DOUBLE = 0

' Loop through the values
FOR i = 1 TO count STEP 1

    ' Print the value of i
    PRINT "i = "; i

    ' Add i to the total
    total = total + i

    ' Calculate the average
    average = total / count

    ' Print the current total and average
    PRINT "Total: "; total
    PRINT "Average: "; average

    ' Increment the count
    count = count + 1

    ' Check if count is equal to or greater than 10
    IF count >= 10 THEN
        PRINT "Count has reached 10."
        END
    END IF
