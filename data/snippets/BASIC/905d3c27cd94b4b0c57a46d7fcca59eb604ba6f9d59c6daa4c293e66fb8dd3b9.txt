' This program will calculate the factorial of a given number
' The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number
' For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

INPUT "Enter a number to find its factorial: ", num ' Prompt user for number
result = 1 ' Initialize result variable to 1
FOR i = 1 TO num ' Loop from 1 to the given number
    result = result * i ' Multiply result by the current value of i
NEXT i ' Repeat loop until i reaches the given number

PRINT "The factorial of "; num; " is "; result ' Output result to user
END ' End program
