' Random Number Generator
' This program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it
' if the user's guess is too low, it will print "Too low, try again."
' if the user's guess is too high, it will print "Too high, try again."
' if the user guesses correctly, it will print "Congratulations, you guessed the number!"

' Create variables
RANDOMIZE TIMER 'establishes a seed for the random number generator
DIM guess AS INTEGER 'stores the user's guess
DIM number AS INTEGER 'stores the randomly generated number
DIM count AS INTEGER 'stores the number of guesses
