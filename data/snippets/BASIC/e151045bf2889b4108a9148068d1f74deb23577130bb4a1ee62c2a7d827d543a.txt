' This program calculates the factorial of a given number

dim num as integer ' declare a variable to store the input number
dim fact as integer ' declare a variable to store the factorial value
dim i as integer ' declare a variable for loop counter

print "Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "
input num ' receive user input for the number

fact = 1 ' set the initial value of factorial to 1

for i = 1 to num ' loop from 1 to the input number
    fact = fact * i ' multiply the current factorial value with the loop counter
next i

print "The factorial of " + str$(num) + " is: " + str$(fact) ' display the result

end ' end the program
