' A program to calculate the average of a list of numbers
' Initialize variables
numbers = Array(5, 10, 15, 20, 25) ' Sample list of numbers
total = 0
count = 0

' Loop through the numbers and add them to the total
For i = 0 to UBound(numbers) ' UBound() function returns the upper bound of the array
    total = total + numbers(i) ' Add the current number to the total
    count = count + 1 ' Increment the count variable
Next i ' Move to the next number in the list

' Calculate the average by dividing the total by the count
average = total / count

' Display the result
PRINT "The average of the numbers is " + average
