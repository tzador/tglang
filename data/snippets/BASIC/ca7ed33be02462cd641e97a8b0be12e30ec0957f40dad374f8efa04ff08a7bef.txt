REM This program calculates the surface area and volume of a sphere
REM and then outputs the results to the screen
DIM diameter AS Integer
DIM radius AS Float
DIM pi AS Float
DIM surfaceArea AS Float
DIM volume AS Float

PRINT "Enter the diameter of the sphere: ";  
INPUT diameter  // prompts user to enter the diameter of the sphere
radius = diameter / 2 // calculates the radius using the given diameter
pi = 3.14159 // assigns the value of pi
surfaceArea = 4 * pi * radius * radius // calculates the surface area of the sphere
volume = (4 / 3) * pi * radius * radius * radius // calculates the volume of the sphere

PRINT "The surface area of the sphere is: "; surfaceArea // outputs the calculated surface area to the screen
PRINT "The volume of the sphere is: "; volume // outputs the calculated volume to the screen
