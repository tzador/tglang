' This program calculates the sum of first 10 natural numbers

' Declaring variables
DIM total AS INTEGER
DIM counter AS INTEGER

' Initializing variables
total = 0
counter = 1

' Looping through first 10 natural numbers
FOR num = 1 TO 10
  total = total + counter
  counter = counter + 1
  PRINT "Step " + counter + ": " + total
NEXT num

' Printing final result
PRINT "The sum of first 10 natural numbers is: " + total
