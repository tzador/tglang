' This code snippet demonstrates a complex subroutine in the BASIC programming language

' Initialize variables

INT X # holds user input
INT Y # holds calculated value
INT Z # holds total sum

' Print instructions
PRINT "Enter an integer:"

' Get user input and store in variable X
INPUT X

' Check if input is positive
IF X < 0 THEN
  ' If input is negative, print error message and exit subroutine
  PRINT "Error: Input must be a positive integer"
  GOTO Exit
END IF

' Calculate value of Y by subtracting 2 from input
Y = X - 2

' Loop through values from 1 to Y and add to Z
FOR I = 1 TO Y
  Z = Z + I
NEXT I

' Print result
PRINT "The sum of integers from 1 to " + STR$(Y) + " is " + STR$(Z)

Exit: ' End of subroutine
