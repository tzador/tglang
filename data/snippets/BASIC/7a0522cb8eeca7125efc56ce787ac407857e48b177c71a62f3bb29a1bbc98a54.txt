REM This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms

n = 10      REM change this value to desired number of terms
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1

FOR i = 2 TO n
    fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2)       REM calculate next term using previous two terms
NEXT i

PRINT "The Fibonacci sequence up to " + n + " terms is:"
FOR i = 0 TO n
    PRINT fib(i);                       REM print each term separated by a space
NEXT i
