REM Program to calculate factorial of a number

LET base = 5 REM base number
LET factorial = 1 REM variable to store factorial value
LET count = 1 REM counter variable

FOR count = 1 TO base REM loop from 1 to base number
    LET factorial = factorial * count REM multiply factorial value by current count
NEXT count REM loop ends here

PRINT "Factorial of " & base & " is " & factorial REM output factorial value

END REM end of program
