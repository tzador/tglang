REM This program will calculate the factorial of a given number

INPUT "Enter a number: "; X
LET FACTORIAL = 1 REM initialize factorial variable
LET I = 1 REM initialize loop counter

WHILE I <= X REM loop until counter reaches input number
  LET FACTORIAL = FACTORIAL * I REM update factorial value
  LET I = I + 1 REM increment loop counter
WEND

REM output the factorial value
PRINT "The factorial of "; X; " is "; FACTORIAL

END REM end of program
