'A BASIC code that generates 10 random numbers and calculates their average

'Initialize variables
DIM num_list(10) AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS INTEGER
DIM avg AS INTEGER
DIM count AS INTEGER

'Loop through 10 numbers and generate random values between 1 and 10
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    num_list(i) = INT(RND * 10) + 1
NEXT i

'Calculate the sum of the numbers
FOR j = 1 TO 10
    sum = sum + num_list(j)
NEXT j

'Calculate the average of the numbers
avg = sum / 10

'Print out the numbers and their average
FOR k = 1 TO 10
    PRINT "Number " + STR(k) + ": " + STR(num_list(k))
NEXT k
PRINT "Average: " + STR(avg)
