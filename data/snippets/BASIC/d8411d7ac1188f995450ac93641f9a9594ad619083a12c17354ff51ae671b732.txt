REM This is a program that calculates the volume of a sphere
REM We define the value of PI
DEF PI = 3.14159
REM We ask the user to input the radius of the sphere
INPUT "Enter the radius of the sphere: ", r
REM We calculate the volume using the formula V = (4/3) * PI * r^3
LET V = (4/3) * PI * r^3
REM We print the results with a message
PRINT "The volume of the sphere with a radius of " ; r ; " is " ; V
