REM Generating a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

' First, ask the user to input a number
INPUT "Enter a number: "; num

' Initialize the first two numbers in the sequence
LET first = 0
LET second = 1

' Print the first two numbers in the sequence
PRINT first
PRINT second

' Loop until the sum of the last two numbers exceeds the given number
WHILE first + second <= num
    LET next = first + second  ' Calculate the next number in the sequence
    first = second            ' Move the second number to the first position
    second = next             ' Move the next number to the second position
    PRINT next                ' Print the next number in the sequence
WEND

' Example output for num = 10:
' 0
' 1
' 1
' 2
' 3
' 5
' 8
' Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. This loop continues until the sum of the last two numbers exceeds the given number, which for num = 10 would be 8 + 5 = 13, so the loop stops before printing that number. This generates a Fibonacci sequence up to the given number.
