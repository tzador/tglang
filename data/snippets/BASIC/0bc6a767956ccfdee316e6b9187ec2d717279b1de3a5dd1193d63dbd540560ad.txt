REM Defines an array
DIM numbers[10]
REM Initializes array with values
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

REM Defines a function to calculate the average value of the array
DEF FNaverage(array)
    REM Sets initial total and count values to zero
    total = 0
    count = 0
    REM Loops through each element in the array
    FOR i = 1 TO 10
       REM Adds current element to total and increments count
       total = total + array[i]
       count = count + 1
    NEXT i
    REM Calculates and returns average value
    FNaverage = total / count
END DEF

REM Calls the function and assigns the returned value to average variable
average = FNaverage(numbers)
REM Prints the average value
PRINT "The average value of the numbers is " + average
