' This is a code snippet in BASIC language that calculates the factorial of a given number
' Use integer data type for better precision
INPUT "Enter a number: ", n ' Prompt user to input a number
IF n < 0 THEN ' Check if number is negative
    PRINT "Factorial cannot be calculated for negative number."
ELSE ' If number is not negative
    result = 1 ' Initialize result variable to 1
    FOR i = 1 TO n ' Loop from 1 to n
        result = result * i ' Multiply result by the current value of i
    NEXT i ' End loop
    PRINT "Factorial of "; n; " is: ", result ' Print the final result
END IF ' End if statement
END ' End program
