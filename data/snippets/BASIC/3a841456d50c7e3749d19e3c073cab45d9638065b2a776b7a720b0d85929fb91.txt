REM Program to find the sum of first n natural numbers
DIM n, sum
INPUT "Enter the value of n: ", n
sum = 0

REM Use FOR loop to iterate through numbers 1 to n
FOR i = 1 TO n
  sum = sum + i  REM Add the current number to sum
NEXT i

REM Print the result
PRINT "The sum of first " + STR$(n) + " natural numbers is " + STR$(sum)
