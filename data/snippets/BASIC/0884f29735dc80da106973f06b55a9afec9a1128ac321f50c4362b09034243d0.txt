REM This is a BASIC program to find the sum of numbers in a given list of integers
DEF FNsum(n)
REM Defining a function to calculate the sum of numbers in a list
DIM i, sum
REM Declaring variables "i" as index and "sum" as final sum
sum = 0
REM Initializing the final sum to 0
FOR i = 1 TO n
REM Looping through all the numbers in the list
INPUT num
REM Taking input from user for each number
sum = sum + num
REM Adding the current number to the final sum
NEXT i
REM End of loop
PRINT "The sum of the numbers in the list is: " + STR$(sum)
REM Printing the final sum as a string
END FN
REM End of function
CLS
REM Clearing the screen
DIM list[10]
REM Declaring an array of size 10 to store the list of numbers
INPUT "Enter the number of elements in the list: ", n
REM Taking input from user for the number of elements in the list
FOR i = 1 TO n
REM Looping through all the elements in the list
INPUT "Enter element " + STR$(i) + ": ", list[i]
REM Taking input from user for each element and storing it in the array
NEXT i
REM End of loop
PRINT "The list of numbers is:"
REM Printing a header for the list of numbers
FOR i = 1 TO n
REM Looping through all the numbers in the list
PRINT list[i]
REM Printing each number in a new line
NEXT i
REM End of loop
PRINT "Calculating the sum..."
REM Printing a message to indicate that the sum is being calculated
PRINT "The sum of the numbers in the list is: " + STR$(FNsum(n))
REM Calling the function to calculate the sum and printing the result as a string
