REM Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
DEF FN FACTORIAL(X)
    REM Define variables for input and output
    LET N = X
    LET FACTORIAL = 1
    REM Use a loop to calculate the factorial
    FOR I = 1 TO N
        LET FACTORIAL = FACTORIAL * I
    NEXT I
    REM Print the result
    PRINT "The factorial of " X "is " FACTORIAL
END DEF
REM Call the function with a given number
LET RESULT = FN FACTORIAL(5)
REM Print the result
PRINT RESULT
