REM Procedure to calculate a fibonacci number
INPUT "Enter the desired index for fibonacci number: "; num
REM Initialize list of fibonacci numbers
DIM f[20]
REM Set first two numbers in the list to 0 and 1
f[0] = 0
f[1] = 1
REM Loop through the list and calculate fibonacci numbers using the formula
FOR i = 2 TO num STEP 1
    f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]
NEXT i
REM Print the fibonacci number at the desired index
PRINT "The fibonacci number at index "; num; " is: "; f[num]
