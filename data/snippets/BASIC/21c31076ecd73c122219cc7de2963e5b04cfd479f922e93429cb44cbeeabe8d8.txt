' This code snippet calculates the sum of squares of numbers in a given list
FOR i = 1 TO 10 ' Loop through the numbers from 1 to 10
    num = nums(i) ' Get a number from the list
    square = num * num ' Calculate the square of the number
    sum = sum + square ' Add the square to the overall sum
    PRINT "Square of "; num; " is "; square ' Print the square of the current number
NEXT i ' Move to the next number in the loop

' Print the final sum of squares
PRINT "Sum of squares is ";sum
