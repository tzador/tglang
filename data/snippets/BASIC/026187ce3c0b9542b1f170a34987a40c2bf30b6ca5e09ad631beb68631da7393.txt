REM This is a BASIC program that prompts the user for two numbers and performs a series of calculations based on those numbers.
REM This program was developed for educational purposes only.

REM Define variables to store the user's input
INPUT "Enter the first number: ", num1
INPUT "Enter the second number: ", num2

REM Perform basic arithmetic calculations
LET sum = num1 + num2
LET diff = num1 - num2
LET prod = num1 * num2
LET quot = num1 / num2

REM Display the results to the user
PRINT "Sum: "; sum
PRINT "Difference: "; diff
PRINT "Product: "; prod
PRINT "Quotient: "; quot

REM Check if either of the numbers is a multiple of 5
IF num1 MOD 5 = 0 THEN
    PRINT num1; " is a multiple of 5."
ELSE
    PRINT num1; " is not a multiple of 5."
END IF

IF num2 MOD 5 = 0 THEN
    PRINT num2; " is a multiple of 5."
ELSE
    PRINT num2; " is not a multiple of 5."
END IF

REM Calculate the average of the two numbers
LET avg = (num1 + num2) / 2
PRINT "Average: "; avg

REM Check if the average is a whole number
IF avg MOD 1 = 0 THEN
    PRINT "Average is a whole number."
ELSE
    PRINT "Average is not a whole number."
END IF
