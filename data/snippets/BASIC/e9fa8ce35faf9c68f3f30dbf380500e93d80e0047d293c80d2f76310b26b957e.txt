REM This section of code sorts a list of numbers in ascending order

INPUT "Enter the number of elements in the list: "; n
REM Receive user input for number of elements in list

DIM numList(n)
REM Declare an array of size n to store the numbers

FOR i = 1 TO n
REM Loop through the array and receive user input for each element
    INPUT "Enter number for element "; i; ": "; numList(i)
NEXT i

REM Use bubble sort algorithm to sort the numbers
FOR i = 1 TO n-1
    FOR j = 1 TO n-i
        IF numList(j) > numList(j+1) THEN
            REM Swap the numbers if they are out of order

REM Print the sorted list
