' This program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion

' Prompt the user to enter a number
PRINT "Enter a number:"
INPUT num

' Print the result by calling the factorial function
PRINT "The factorial of "; num; " is "; FNfactorial(num)

' Sample output:
' Enter a number:
' 5
' The factorial of 5 is 120
