REM This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
INPUT "Enter a number: ", n
DIM fib_seq(n)
REM The first two numbers in the sequence are always 0 and 1
fib_seq(0) = 0
fib_seq(1) = 1
REM Loop through the array and calculate each subsequent number in the sequence
FOR i = 2 TO n
    fib_seq(i) = fib_seq(i-1) + fib_seq(i-2)
NEXT i
REM Print the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number
PRINT "The Fibonacci sequence up to " + n + " is:"
FOR i = 0 TO n
    PRINT fib_seq(i)
NEXT i
