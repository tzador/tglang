REM Define variables in BASIC
DIM num1, num2 AS INTEGER
DIM result AS FLOAT

REM Set initial values for variables
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
result = 0.0

REM Define function to calculate the average of two numbers
DEF FN average(x, y) = (x + y) / 2

REM Call function and store result in variable
result = FNaverage(num1, num2)

REM Output the result with a print statement
PRINT "The average of ", num1, "and ", num2, "is ", result
