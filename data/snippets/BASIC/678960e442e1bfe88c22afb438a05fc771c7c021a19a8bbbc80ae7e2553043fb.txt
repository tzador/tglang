' This program calculates the average of three numbers
' Input the three numbers
INPUT "Enter first number: ", num1
INPUT "Enter second number: ", num2
INPUT "Enter third number: ", num3

' Calculate the sum of the three numbers
total = num1 + num2 + num3

' Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 3
' Note: The result is stored as a floating point number
average = total / 3

' Output the average
PRINT "The average is: "; average

' Check if the average is above or below 50
IF average > 50 THEN
    PRINT "The average is above 50"
ELSEIF average < 50 THEN
    PRINT "The average is below 50"
ELSE
    PRINT "The average is exactly 50"
END IF

' Calculate the product of the three numbers
product = num1 * num2 * num3

' Output the product
PRINT "The product is: "; product

' Check if the product is positive or negative
IF product >= 0 THEN
    PRINT "The product is positive"
ELSE
    PRINT "The product is negative"
END IF

' Find the difference between the largest and smallest numbers
' Note: We assume the user enters distinct numbers in increasing order
difference = num3 - num1

' Output the result
PRINT "The difference between the largest and smallest numbers is: "; difference
