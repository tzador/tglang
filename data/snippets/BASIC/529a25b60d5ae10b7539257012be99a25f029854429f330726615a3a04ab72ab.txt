REM This is a program that performs a bubble sort on an array of integers
DIM nums(10) AS INTEGER         REM Define an array with 10 elements to be sorted
FOR i = 0 TO 9                  REM Loop through each element in the array
    INPUT "Enter a number: "; nums(i)   REM Prompt user to input a number and store it in array
NEXT i                          REM End loop
PRINT "Original Array:"         REM Print out original array
FOR i = 0 TO 9                  REM Loop through each element in the array
    PRINT nums(i);               REM Print out each element in the array
NEXT i                          REM End loop
FOR i = 0 TO 8                  REM Loop through array up to second-to-last element
    FOR j = 0 TO 8 - i          REM Loop through unsorted elements
        IF nums(j) > nums(j + 1) THEN    REM Check if current element is greater than next element
            temp = nums(j)       REM If so, swap elements
            nums(j) = nums(j + 1)
            nums(j + 1) = temp
        END IF
    NEXT j                   REM End inner loop
NEXT i                      REM End outer loop
PRINT "Sorted Array:"       REM Print out sorted array
FOR i = 0 TO 9              REM Loop through each element in the array
    PRINT nums(i);           REM Print out each element in the array
NEXT i                      REM End loop
