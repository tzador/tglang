' This code snippet generates a random password with specified length

REM Import system libraries
USES "sys/types"

REM Define constant variables
CONST passwordLength = 10
CONST minChar = 33
CONST maxChar = 126

REM Define string variable to store password
DIM password AS STRING

REM Generate random values and append to the password string
FOR i = 1 TO passwordLength
    randomNumber = INT(RND * (maxChar - minChar + 1)) + minChar ' Generate random number between minChar and maxChar
    password = password + CHR$(randomNumber) ' Convert number to character and append to password string
NEXT i

REM Print password
PRINT "Random password: " + password
