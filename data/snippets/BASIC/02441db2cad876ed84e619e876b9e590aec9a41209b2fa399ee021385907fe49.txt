INPUT "Enter a number: ", N ' Prompts user to enter a number
LET FACTORIAL = 1 ' Initializes factorial variable to 1
FOR I = 1 TO N ' Loop that runs from 1 to N
    LET FACTORIAL = FACTORIAL * I ' Calculates factorial by multiplying current factorial value with loop index
NEXT I ' End of loop
PRINT "Factorial of "; N; " is "; FACTORIAL  ' Outputs result to user
END ' Ends program
