' This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
' Input the maximum number to calculate to
INPUT "Enter maximum number: ", max
' Set up the first two numbers in the sequence
F1 = 0
F2 = 1
' Loop until the Fibonacci number is greater than the maximum
WHILE F2 <= max
' Calculate next number in sequence by adding the previous two numbers
F3 = F1 + F2
' Print the current number in the sequence
PRINT F3
' Shift the numbers to continue the sequence
F1 = F2
F2 = F3
