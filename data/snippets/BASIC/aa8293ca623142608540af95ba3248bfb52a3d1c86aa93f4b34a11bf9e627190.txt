'---[Program Description]---

REM This program calculates the perimeter of a triangle using user input.

'---[Variable Declaration]---

DIM s1 AS INTEGER 'side 1 of the triangle
DIM s2 AS INTEGER 'side 2 of the triangle
DIM s3 AS INTEGER 'side 3 of the triangle
DIM perimeter AS INTEGER 'result variable to store the perimeter
DIM decision AS STRING 'variable to store user decision on repeating program

'---[Main Program]---

CLS 'clears screen before displaying program
PRINT "Welcome to the Triangle Perimeter Calculator!" 'program header
DO 'starts main program loop
    PRINT "Please enter the length of side 1 of your triangle: "
    INPUT s1 'prompts user for input and stores in variable
    PRINT "Please enter the length of side 2 of your triangle: "
    INPUT s2 'prompts user for input and stores in variable
    PRINT "Please enter the length of side 3 of your triangle: "
    INPUT s3 'prompts user for input and stores in variable
    perimeter = s1 + s2 + s3 'calculates perimeter and stores in result variable
    PRINT "The perimeter of your triangle is: "; perimeter 'displays result to user
    PRINT "Do you want to calculate the perimeter of another triangle? (Y/N)"
    INPUT decision 'prompts user for decision to repeat program
LOOP UNTIL decision = "N" 'checks if user chose to stop program, if not, loop repeats
