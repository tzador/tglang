REM This is a long and complex code snippet in BASIC

' Initialize variables
DIM a AS INTEGER
DIM b AS INTEGER
DIM c AS INTEGER
DIM count AS INTEGER
DIM result AS INTEGER

' Set initial values
a = 0     ' first number
b = 1     ' second number
count = 0 ' counter for number of iterations

' Loop until we have executed 100 iterations
WHILE count < 100 DO
    c = a + b           ' calculate next Fibonacci number
    PRINT "The " + STR$(count+1) + "th Fibonacci number is " + STR$(c) ' output the result
    a = b               ' shift values for next iteration
    b = c
    count = count + 1
DOUBLE ENTER LOOP 'repeat until iteration count reaches 100
