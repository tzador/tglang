REM This is a complex code snippet that uses nested loops to print a pattern
REM The pattern is composed of asterisks and spaces in a triangle shape
FOR i = 1 TO 5 REM Loop to iterate through each row
  FOR j = 1 TO i REM Loop to print asterisks in each row
    PRINT "*"
  NEXT
  FOR k = 1 TO 5 - i REM Loop to print spaces in each row
    PRINT " "
  NEXT
  FOR l = 1 TO 5 - i REM Loop to print spaces in each row
    PRINT " "
  NEXT
  FOR m = 1 TO i REM Loop to print asterisks in each row
    PRINT "*"
  NEXT
  PRINT CHR$(10) REM Print new line character
NEXT
