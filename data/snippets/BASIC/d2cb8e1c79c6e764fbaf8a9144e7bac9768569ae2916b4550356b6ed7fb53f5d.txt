DIM num_values AS INTEGER
DIM input_value AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter number of values to be averaged: ", num_values

REM Get input values and calculate sum
FOR i = 1 TO num_values
  INPUT "Enter value " + STR$(i) + ": ", input_value
  sum = sum + input_value
NEXT i

REM Calculate average
average = sum / num_values

REM Print result
PRINT "The average is: "; average
