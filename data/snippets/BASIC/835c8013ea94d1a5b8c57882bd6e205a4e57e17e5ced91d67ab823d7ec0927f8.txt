' This code snippet calculates the factorial of a given integer input
' The variable "n" represents the input integer
' The variable "result" will store the factorial value
dim n as integer
dim result as integer
input "Enter a number: ", n ' takes user input for integer
result = 1 ' initialize result to 1
for i = 1 to n ' loops from 1 to input integer
    result = result * i ' multiplies result by i in each iteration
next i ' moves to next iteration of loop
print "The factorial of " ; n ; " is "; result ' outputs the factorial value
end ' end of program
