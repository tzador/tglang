'// This code snippet is a BASIC program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to 100.
'// It uses a FOR loop and an IF statement to determine the next number in the sequence.

'//-- Initialize variables and arrays
DIM fib(100) AS INTEGER '// Defines an array to store the sequence
DIM first AS INTEGER '// Stores the first number in the sequence
DIM second AS INTEGER '// Stores the second number in the sequence
DIM next AS INTEGER '// Stores the next number in the sequence

'//-- Set first two numbers in sequence
first = 0 '// Sets first number to 0
second = 1 '// Sets second number to 1
fib(0) = first '// Stores first number in array
fib(1) = second '// Stores second number in array

'//-- FOR loop to generate sequence
FOR i = 2 TO 100 '// Starts at third number in sequence and goes up to 100
	next = first + second '// Calculates next number by adding first and second
	fib(i) = next '// Stores next number in array
	first = second '// Updates first number to be the previous second
	second = next '// Updates second number to be the next number
NEXT i

'//-- IF statement to print sequence up to 100
FOR j = 0 TO 99 '// Loops through all numbers in the array
	IF fib(j) <= 100 THEN '// Checks if number is less than or equal to 100
		PRINT fib(j); '// Prints number followed by a space
	END IF
NEXT j
