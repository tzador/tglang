' This program calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle

' Define variables for length, width, area, and perimeter
DIM length AS INTEGER
DIM width AS INTEGER
DIM area AS INTEGER
DIM perimeter AS INTEGER

' Get user input for length and width
INPUT "Enter the length of the rectangle: ", length
INPUT "Enter the width of the rectangle: ", width

' Calculate the area and perimeter
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

' Print the results
PRINT "The area of the rectangle is "; area
PRINT "The perimeter of the rectangle is "; perimeter
