' This code snippet generates a random password of specified length using letters, numbers, and special characters
' Declare variables
DIM password AS STRING
DIM length AS INTEGER
DIM i AS INTEGER
DIM character AS STRING

' Define character sets
LET letters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" ' all letters in alphabet
LET numbers = "0123456789" ' all numbers
LET special_characters = "!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]:;<>,.?/" ' all special characters

' Prompt for length of password desired
INPUT "Enter desired password length: ", length

' Generate random password
FOR i = 0 TO length
    LET character = MID(letters, INT(RND * LEN(letters)) + 1, 1) ' choose a random letter from letters set
    password = password + character ' add letter to password
