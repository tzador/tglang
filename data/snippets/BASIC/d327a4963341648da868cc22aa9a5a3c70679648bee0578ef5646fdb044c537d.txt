REM This is a long and complex code snippet in BASIC
DIM num1 AS INTEGER           'Declare variable num1 as integer
DIM num2 AS INTEGER           'Declare variable num2 as integer
DIM total AS INTEGER          'Declare variable total as integer
PRINT "Enter first number:"   'Print message to prompt user for input
INPUT num1                    'Get input from user and store in num1
PRINT "Enter second number:"  'Print message to prompt user for input
INPUT num2                    'Get input from user and store in num2
total = num1 + num2           'Add num1 and num2 and store result in total
PRINT "The sum is:"; total    'Print message and sum to the console
