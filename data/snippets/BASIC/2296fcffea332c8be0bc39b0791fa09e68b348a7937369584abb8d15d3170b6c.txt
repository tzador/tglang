REM This program takes a user-input number and checks if it is prime
A$ = INPUT "Enter a number: "  REM prompts user to enter a number
N = VAL(A$)  REM converts input string to a number
IF N > 1 THEN  REM checks if number is positive and greater than 1
    i = 2
    DO WHILE i < N  REM starts a loop for checking factors of number
        IF N MOD i = 0 THEN EXIT  REM checks if number is divisible by a factor, if so exits loop
        i = i + 1
    LOOP
    IF i = N THEN  REM if loop completed without finding a factor, number is prime
        PRINT N; " is a prime number"  REM prints out number and prime status
    ELSE  REM if loop exited early, number is not prime
        PRINT N; " is not a prime number"  REM prints out number and prime status
ELSE  REM if number is not positive or greater than 1, it is not prime
    PRINT N; " is not a valid number to check"  REM prints out number and error message
END IF  REM ends the if-else statement
