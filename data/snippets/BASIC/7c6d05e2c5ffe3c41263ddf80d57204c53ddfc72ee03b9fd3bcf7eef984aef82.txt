REM This is a BASIC program to find the sum of the first 10 natural numbers
DIM n AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS DOUBLE
REM Set initial value for sum
sum = 0
REM For loop to iterate through first 10 natural numbers
FOR n = 1 TO 10
REM Increment sum by current number
sum = sum + n
NEXT n
REM Print the final sum
PRINT "The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is" sum
