REM This program calculates the factorial of a given number
PRINT "Enter a number: ";
INPUT num

REM validate input - check if the number is positive
IF num < 0 THEN
    PRINT "Factorial does not exist for negative numbers."
    END
END IF

REM initialize variables
factorial = 1
count = 1

REM loop through numbers from 1 to input number
WHILE count <= num DO

    REM calculate factorial by multiplying with current number
    factorial = factorial * count

    REM increment count
    count = count + 1
END WHILE

REM print result
PRINT "Factorial of " + STR$(num) + " is: " + STR$(factorial)
