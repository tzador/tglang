REM This program calculates the factorial of a given number

INPUT "Enter a number: ", num  REM user inputs the number to calculate factorial for
factorial = 1 REM initialize factorial variable with initial value of 1

IF num < 0 THEN  REM checks if the number is negative
    PRINT "Factorial cannot be calculated for negative numbers."  REM prints error message
ELSEIF num = 0 THEN  REM checks if the number is zero
    PRINT "Factorial of 0 is 1."  REM prints result
ELSE  REM if number is positive
    FOR i = 1 TO num  REM loop from 1 to given number
        factorial = factorial * i  REM calculates factorial by multiplying with previous value
    NEXT i  REM end of loop
END IF  REM end of if statement

PRINT "The factorial of "; num; " is "; factorial  REM prints the calculated factorial
