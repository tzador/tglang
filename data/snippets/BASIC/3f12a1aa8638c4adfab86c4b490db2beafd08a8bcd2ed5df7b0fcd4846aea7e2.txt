' This program calculates the factorial of a given number

DIM num AS INTEGER ' variable to hold the number
DIM fact AS INTEGER ' variable to hold the factorial

INPUT "Enter a number: ", num ' prompt user to input a number

fact = 1 ' initialize factorial variable to 1

FOR i = 1 TO num ' loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number
    fact = fact * i ' multiply the current factorial value by the current number
NEXT i

PRINT "The factorial of "; num; " is "; fact ' output the result in a user-friendly format
