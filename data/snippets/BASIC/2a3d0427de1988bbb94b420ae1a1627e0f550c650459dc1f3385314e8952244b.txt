REM Declare variables
DIM a AS INTEGER, b AS INTEGER, c AS INTEGER

REM Set initial values
a = 5
b = 7

REM Perform calculation
c = a + b * 3

REM Print result
PRINT "The sum of " + STR$(a) + " and " + STR$(b) + " multiplied by 3 is: "
PRINT c

REM Check if sum is greater than 20
IF c > 20 THEN
    PRINT "The sum is greater than 20."
ELSE
    PRINT "The sum is not greater than 20."
END IF

REM Define and call function to calculate factorial
DEF FACT(n)
    PRODUCT = 1
    FOR i = 1 TO n
        PRODUCT = PRODUCT * i
    NEXT i
    FACT = PRODUCT
END DEF

REM Calculate and print factorial of c 
PRINT "The factorial of " + STR$(c) + " is " + STR$(FACT(c))
