' This program is a basic implementation of the Fibonacci sequence algorithm.

' Declare variables for storing the first two numbers in the sequence
DIM FIRST_NUM
DIM SECOND_NUM

' Initialize the variables with the first two values in the sequence
FIRST_NUM = 0
SECOND_NUM = 1

' Declare a variable to store the next number in the sequence
DIM NEW_NUM

' Declare a variable to store the total number of terms to be generated
DIM COUNT

' Prompt the user to input the number of terms to be generated
PRINT "Enter the number of terms to be generated:"
INPUT COUNT

' Print the first two numbers in the sequence
PRINT FIRST_NUM
PRINT SECOND_NUM

' Use a loop to calculate and print the remaining numbers in the sequence
FOR I = 3 TO COUNT
    ' Calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers
    NEW_NUM = FIRST_NUM + SECOND_NUM

    ' Print the new number
    PRINT NEW_NUM

    ' Update the variables for the next iteration of the loop
    FIRST_NUM = SECOND_NUM
    SECOND_NUM = NEW_NUM
NEXT I

' End the program with a message
PRINT "Program completed successfully."
