REM This is a BASIC code snippet
REM It declares two variables, does some arithmetic operations, and outputs the result

DIM num1 AS INTEGER  ' declare first variable as integer
DIM num2 AS INTEGER  ' declare second variable as integer
num1 = 10  ' assign value of 10 to first variable
num2 = 5  ' assign value of 5 to second variable
REM perform arithmetic operations
num1 = num1 + num2  ' add values of both variables and store in first variable
num1 = num1 - num2  ' subtract value of second variable from first variable and store in first variable
num1 = num1 * num2  ' multiply values of both variables and store in first variable
num1 = num1 / num2  ' divide value of first variable by second variable and store in first variable

REM output the result
PRINT "The result of arithmetic operations is " & num1
