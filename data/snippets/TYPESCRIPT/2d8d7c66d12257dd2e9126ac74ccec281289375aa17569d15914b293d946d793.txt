/*
This is a complex TypeScript code snippet that creates a class named "Vehicle" with two properties: "type" and "speed".
The class takes in a parameter "vehicleType" and assigns it to the property "type" of the class.
The class also has a method named "accelerate" which takes in a parameter "newSpeed" and updates the property "speed" of the class.
At the end, an instance of the class is created and the method "accelerate" is called.
*/

class Vehicle {
  type: string;
  speed: number;
  
  constructor(vehicleType: string) {
    this.type = vehicleType;
    this.speed = 0;
  }
  
  accelerate(newSpeed: number) {
    this.speed = newSpeed;
    console.log(`The ${this.type} is now traveling at ${this.speed} mph.`);
  }
}

let car = new Vehicle("car");
car.accelerate(60); // output: The car is now traveling at 60 mph.
