// This code snippet defines a class named "Person" with two properties: "name" and "age".
class Person {
  name: string; // a string property to store the name of the person
  age: number; // a number property to store the age of the person

  // a constructor function that initializes the properties with the values provided as arguments
  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  // a method to print out the person's name and age in the console
  printDetails(): void {
    console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`);
  }
}

// creating an instance of the Person class with the name "John" and age 25
let john = new Person("John", 25);

// calling the printDetails method on the john instance to print out the details
john.printDetails();
