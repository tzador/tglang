// This code snippet is a function called "calculateFactorial" that takes in a number and returns the factorial of that number
function calculateFactorial(number: number) {
  // Initialize a variable to store the factorial value
  let factorial = 1;

  // Loop through numbers from 1 to the given number
  for(let i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
    // Multiply the current value of the factorial with the current number
    factorial = factorial * i;
  }

  // Return the calculated factorial value
  return factorial;
}

// Example usage of the function
let number = 5;
let result = calculateFactorial(number);

console.log(`The factorial of ${number} is: ${result}`);
// Output: The factorial of 5 is: 120
