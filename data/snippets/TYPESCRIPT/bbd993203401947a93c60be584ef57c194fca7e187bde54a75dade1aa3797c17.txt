//Define a class

  age: number;
  
  //Initialize constructor
  constructor(name: string, type: string, age: number) {

  //Create method
  displayInfo(): void {

//Create an instance of the class
let dog = new Animal("Max", "dog", 3);

//Call the method to display info
dog.displayInfo();

//Create a subclass that extends the Animal class
class Cat extends Animal {

  //Initialize constructor
  constructor(name: string, age: number, breed: string) {
    //Call parent class constructor with super
    super(name, "cat", age);

//Create an instance of the Cat class
let cat = new Cat("Fluffy", 5, "Siamese");

//Call the method to display info
cat.displayInfo();

//Output:
//The dog, Max, is 3 years old.
//Fluffy is a Siamese cat and is 5 years old.
