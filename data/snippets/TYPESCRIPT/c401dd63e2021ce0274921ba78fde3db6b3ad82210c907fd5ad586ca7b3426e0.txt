//Example of a class with a constructor and three methods
class Animal {
    //properties
    name: string;

    //method to change species
    changeSpecies(newSpecies: string): void {
        this.species = newSpecies;

    //method to make animal sound
    makeSound(): void {
        console.log(`The ${this.species} named ${this.name} makes a loud roar`)

}

//creating instances of the Animal class
let lion = new Animal("Leo", "lion", 5);
let elephant = new Animal("Ellie", "elephant", 10);

//calling methods on instances
console.log(lion.name); //output: Leo
console.log(elephant.getAge()); //output: 10
lion.changeSpecies("tiger");
lion.makeSound(); //output: The tiger named Leo makes a loud roar
