//Define a function called "sum" that takes in two parameters

//Create a class called "Employee" with three properties, "name" of type string, "position" of type string, and "salary" of type number

    let bonus = this.salary * (percentage/100);

//Create an instance of the Employee class
const employee = new Employee("Bob", "Manager", 50000);
//Call the "calculateBonus" method on the employee instance and store the result in a variable "bonusAmount"
let bonusAmount = employee.calculateBonus(10);  //Output: 5000
