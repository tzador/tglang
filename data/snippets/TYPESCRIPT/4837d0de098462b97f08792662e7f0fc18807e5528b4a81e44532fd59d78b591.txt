// This is a long and complex code snippet in TypeScript

// Declare a class named "Person"
class Person {
  // Define private properties for the class
  private firstName: string;
  private lastName: string;
  private age: number;
  private occupation: string;

  constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string, age: number, occupation: string) {
    // Set the values of the properties in the constructor
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
    this.occupation = occupation;
  }

  // Define public method for the class
  public introduce(): void {
    // Print a formatted string to introduce the person
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} and I am ${this.age} years old. I work as a ${this.occupation}.`);
  }
}

// Create an instance of the Person class
const john = new Person("John", "Smith", 30, "Software Engineer");

// Call the introduce method to introduce John
john.introduce();

// Output:
// Hello, my name is John Smith and I am 30 years old. I work as a Software Engineer.
