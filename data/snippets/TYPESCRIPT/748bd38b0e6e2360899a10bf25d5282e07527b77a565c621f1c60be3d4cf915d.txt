//This code snippet creates a class named "person" with a constructor and two methods

class Person {
  
  //Constructor for the class, takes in two parameters: name (string) and age (number)

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  //Method that returns the name of the person

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  //Method that returns the current age of the person and increments the age by 1

  getAge() {
    const currentAge: number = this.age;
    this.age++;
    return currentAge;
  }

}

//Instance of the Person class, passing in "John" as the name and 25 as the age

const john: Person = new Person("John", 25);

//Output of the getName method

console.log(john.getName()); //John

//Output of the getAge method

console.log(john.getAge()); //25 
console.log(john.getAge()); //26 (age has been incremented by 1)
