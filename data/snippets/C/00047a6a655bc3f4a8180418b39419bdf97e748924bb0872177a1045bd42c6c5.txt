//Example code snippet in C

#include <stdio.h> //Include standard IO library

int main() //Main function
{
    int num1 = 10; //Initialize first variable with value 10
    int num2 = 5; //Initialize second variable with value 5
    int num3 = 0; //Initialize third variable with value 0

    for(int i = 0; i < num1; i++){ //For loop with i starting at 0 and incrementing until it is less than num1
        num3 += num2; //Add num2 to num3
    }

    printf("The result of multiplying %d and %d is %d.", num1, num2, num3); //Print the result

    return 0; //Return 0 to indicate successful completion of the program
}

/*Expected Output:
The result of multiplying 10 and 5 is 50.
