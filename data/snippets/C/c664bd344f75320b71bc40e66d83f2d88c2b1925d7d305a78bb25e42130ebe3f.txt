/*
This is a code snippet demonstrating a function in C that calculates the factorial of a number.
It uses recursion and a loop to calculate the factorial.
Inputs:
- num: the number whose factorial is to be calculated
- spaces: the number of spaces to indent the output for better readability
Outputs:
- factorial: the factorial of the input number
*/
int factorial(int num, int spaces)
{
    // base case: if num is equal to 0, the factorial is 1
    if(num == 0)
    {
        // indent the output by the given number of spaces
        for(int i = 0; i < spaces; i++)
        {
            printf(" ");
        }
        // print the result and return 1

// example usage:
int main()
{
    // calculate the factorial of 5
    factorial(5, 0);
    // output:

    The factorial of 0 is 1
    The factorial of 1 is 1
    The factorial of 2 is 2
    The factorial of 3 is 6
    The factorial of 4 is 24
    The factorial of 5 is 120
