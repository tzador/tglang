% This is a Prolog program to find the sum of all numbers in a list.
sum_list([], 0). % Base case: if the list is empty, the sum is 0.

% Rule to recursively add the first element of the list to the sum of the rest of the list.
sum_list([Head|Tail], Sum) :- 
    sum_list(Tail, Rest), % Recursively call sum_list on the rest of the list.
    Sum is Head + Rest. % Add the head value to the sum of the rest of the list.

% Example query: sum_list([1,2,3,4,5], X).
% Output: X = 15.
