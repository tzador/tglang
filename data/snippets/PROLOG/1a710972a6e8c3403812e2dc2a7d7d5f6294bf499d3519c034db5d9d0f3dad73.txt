%% Define a rule that calculates the factorial of a given number
factorial(0,1). %% Base case: Factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N,F):-
    N > 0, %% Check that N is greater than 0
    N1 is N - 1, %% Calculate N-1
    factorial(N1,F1), %% Recursively calculate the factorial of N-1
    F is N * F1. %% Multiply N with the factorial of N-1 to get the factorial of N

?- factorial(5,Result). %% Query to calculate the factorial of 5
%% Output: Result = 120. This is the expected result since 5! = 120.
