% Define rules for calculating Fibonacci numbers

fib(0,0). % Base case: First Fibonacci number is 0
fib(1,1). % Base case: Second Fibonacci number is 1

fib(N,F) :-                    % Recursive rule for calculating the Nth Fibonacci number
	N > 1,                     % Make sure N is larger than 1, to avoid infinite recursion
	N1 is N - 1,               % Calculate N-1 for the recursive call
	N2 is N - 2,               % Calculate N-2 for the recursive call
	fib(N1,F1),                % Recursively call fib for N-1 to get F1
	fib(N2,F2),                % Recursively call fib for N-2 to get F2
	F is F1 + F2.              % Calculate F by adding F1 and F2

% Define rules for calculating the factorial of a number

factorial(0,1). % Base case: Factorial of 0 is 1

factorial(N,F) :-               % Recursive rule for calculating the factorial of N
	N > 0,                     % Make sure N is larger than 0, to avoid infinite recursion
	N1 is N - 1,               % Calculate N-1 for the recursive call
	factorial(N1,F1),          % Recursively call factorial for N-1 to get F1
	F is N * F1.               % Calculate F by multiplying N and F1
