% This is a simple PROLOG program that defines and queries facts about pets

% The facts are in the form of 'is_a' relationships, where an animal is a certain type of pet

% First we define the facts
is_a(dog, mammal).
is_a(cat, mammal).
is_a(bird, bird).

% Next we define a rule that checks if an animal is a pet based on whether it is a mammal or bird
is_pet(X) :- is_a(X, mammal); is_a(X, bird).

% We can then query the database, for example to see if a dog is a pet
?- is_pet(dog).
% This will return true, since the fact 'dog' is defined as a mammal and therefore a pet.
