%% First, we define some facts about animals and their characteristics

mammal(cat). % A fact that says cats are mammals
mammal(dog). % A fact that says dogs are mammals
mammal(human). % A fact that says humans are mammals

eats(cat, meat). % A fact that says cats eat meat
eats(dog, meat). % A fact that says dogs eat meat

%% Then, we define some rules for determining if an animal is a carnivore or not
%% An animal is considered a carnivore if it is a mammal and eats meat

carnivore(Animal) :- mammal(Animal), eats(Animal, meat).

%% Now, we can query if an animal is a carnivore or not
?- carnivore(dog). % Output: true
?- carnivore(human). % Output: false, humans are not carnivores

%% We can also use variables to query for all carnivores
?- carnivore(X). % Output: X = cat, X = dog (if we press ";" to see more results)
