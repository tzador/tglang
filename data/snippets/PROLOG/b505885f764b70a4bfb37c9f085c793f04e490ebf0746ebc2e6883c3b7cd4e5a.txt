% Prolog code to find the maximum element in a list
% Define max predicate with two arguments: List and Result
max(List, Result) :-
    % Check if the list is empty, if yes then set Result as 0
    List =:= [],
    Result is 0.

% If the list is not empty
max(List, Result) :-
    % Get the head and tail of the list
    List = [Head | Tail],
    % Recursively call max predicate with Tail as argument and Temp as result
    max(Tail, Temp),
    % Check if Head is greater than Temp
    Head > Temp,
    % If yes, then set Result as Head
    Result is Head.

% If Head is not greater than Temp
max(List, Result) :-
    % Recursively call max predicate with Tail as argument and Result as result
    max(Tail, Result).

% Sample query:
% max([5,2,8,4], Result).
% Result will be 8, as it is the maximum element in the list.
