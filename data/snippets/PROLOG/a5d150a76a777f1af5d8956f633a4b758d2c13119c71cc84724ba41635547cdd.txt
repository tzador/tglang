% defining the predicate "append"
% this predicate takes two lists as input
% and appends the second list to the end of the first list
append([],L,L).    % base case: when first list is empty, result is the second list
append([Head|Tail],L,[Head|Result]):-   % head is removed from first list and added to result
    append(Tail,L,Result).    % recursively call append on remaining tail and second list
