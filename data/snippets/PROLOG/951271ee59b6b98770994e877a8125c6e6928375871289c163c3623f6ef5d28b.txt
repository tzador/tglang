% This program finds the factorial of a number using recursion
factorial(0,1). % base case: the factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N,F) :- % recursive case
   N > 0, % only works for positive numbers
   N1 is N-1, % decrease N by 1 for each recursion
   factorial(N1,F1), % recursively call factorial with N1 and assign return value to F1
   F is N * F1. % multiply N with F1 to get the factorial of N

/*
    Example query:
    ?- factorial(5,X).

    Output:
    X = 120.

    This means the factorial of 5 is 120.
