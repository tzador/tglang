% Define the rule 'sibling'
sibling(X, Y) :- X \= Y, % Check if X and Y are not the same
                 findall((Parent, Child), (parent(Parent, X), parent(Parent, Y), X \= Y), List),  % Find all pairs of parents and children that are not the same
                 member((Parent1, Child1), List), % Get the first pair of parents and children
                 member((Parent2, Child2), List), % Get the second pair of parents and children
                 Child1 \= Child2, % Check if the children are not the same
                 Parent1 \= Parent2. % Check if the parents are not the same
