% Rules for determining family relationships.
father(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y), male(X).  % X is the father of Y if X is a parent of Y and X is male
mother(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y), female(X).  % X is the mother of Y if X is a parent of Y and X is female
grandparent(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z).  % X is the grandparent of Z if X is the parent of Y and Y is the parent of Z
sibling(X, Y) :- parent(Z, X), parent(Z, Y), X \== Y.  % X and Y are siblings if they share a parent and are not the same person
brother(X, Y) :- sibling(X, Y), male(X).  % X is the brother of Y if X is a sibling of Y and X is male
sister(X, Y) :- sibling(X, Y), female(X).  % X is the sister of Y if X is a sibling of Y and X is female
uncle(X, Y) :- sibling(X, Z), parent(Z, Y), male(X).  % X is the uncle of Y if X is a sibling of Z (Y's parent) and X is male
aunt(X, Y) :- sibling(X, Z), parent(Z, Y), female(X).  % X is the aunt of Y if X is a sibling of Z (Y's parent) and X is female

% Example query
