% This program defines a family tree and checks if two people are related

parent(john, mark).     % John is the parent of Mark
parent(mary, mark).     % Mary is also the parent of Mark
parent(john, jane).     % John is the parent of Jane
parent(mary, jane).     % Mary is also the parent of Jane

male(john).       % John is a male
female(mary).     % Mary is a female
male(mark).       % Mark is a male
female(jane).     % Jane is a female

sibling(X,Y) :-        % rules for siblings
  parent(Z,X),         % checking if parent of X is the same as parent of Y
  parent(Z,Y),         % checking if parent of Y is the same as parent of X
  X \= Y.              % ensuring that X and Y are not the same person

ancestor(X,Y) :-       % rules for ancestors
  parent(X,Y).         % checking if X is the parent of Y
ancestor(X,Y) :-       
  parent(X,Z),         % checking if X is the parent of Z
  ancestor(Z,Y).       % recursively finding ancestors of Z until it reaches Y

related(X,Y) :-        % rules for checking relatedness between X and Y
  ancestor(X,Y).       % checking if X is an ancestor of Y
related(X,Y) :-        
  ancestor(Y,X).       % checking if Y is an ancestor of X (reverse check)
related(X,Y) :-        
  sibling(X,Y).        % checking if X and Y are siblings
  
related(X,Y) :-        % rules for checking relatedness between X and Y (transitive)
  ancestor(X,Z),       % checking if X is an ancestor of Z
  related(Z,Y).        % recursively checking if Z is related to Y

?- related(john,jane).  % query to check if John and Jane are related
?- related(john,mark).  % query to check if John and Mark are related
