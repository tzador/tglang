% This is a simple Prolog program that finds the maximum element in a list
max([X|Xs], Max) :-           % max(Xs, Max): get the maximum from Xs
    max(Xs, X, Max).          % test the maximum in Xs

% max(Xs, CurrMax, Max)
max([], M, M).                % the maximum of [] is M
max([X|Xs], M, Max) :-
    X > M, !,                 % if X > M, test the rest of Xs with X as the new maximum
    max(Xs, X, Max).
max([_|Xs], CurrMax, Max) :-
    max(Xs, CurrMax, Max).    % otherwise, keep CurrMax as the maximum

% Example of usage
% ?- max([3,7,2,9], X).
% X = 9.
