%This is a prolog program that defines a family tree
/*Facts about family members*/
parent(john, robert). %John is the parent of Robert
parent(john, alice). %John is the parent of Alice
parent(jane, robert). %Jane is the parent of Robert
parent(jane, alice). %Jane is the parent of Alice

/*Rules for determining ancestors*/
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y). %X is the ancestor of Y if X is the parent of Y
ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), ancestor(Z,Y). %X is the ancestor of Y if X is the parent of Z and Z is the ancestor of Y

/*Query to find all ancestors of Alice*/
?- ancestor(X,alice). %X is the ancestor of Alice

/*Expected output:
X = john
X = jane
X = robert
