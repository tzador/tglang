/*This is a Prolog program that defines a predicate check_list that takes a list as input and checks if the elements in the list are increasing*/

% Base case: An empty list is always increasing
check_list([]).

% Recursive case: A list is increasing if its head element is smaller than the next element and the rest of the list is also increasing
check_list([H1, H2 | T]) :-
    H1 < H2,
    check_list([H2 | T]).
