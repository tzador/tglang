% This is a Prolog predicate that checks if a list is a permutation of another list

is_permutation(X,Y):-                           % Defining the predicate with two arguments
    length(X, Length),                          % Get the length of list X
    length(Y, Length),                          % Get the length of list Y
    same_elements(X,Y).                         % Check if both lists have same elements

same_elements([], []).                         % Base case: empty lists have same elements
same_elements([Head|Tail], Y):-                 % Split X into Head and Tail
    select(Head, Y, Y1),                        % Select the Head from Y and store in Y1
    same_elements(Tail, Y1).                    % Recursively check Tail with Y1

select(X, [X|Rest], Rest).                      % Select X from the head of the list
select(X, [Y|Rest], [Y|Rest1]):-                % Recursively compare X with the rest of the list
    select(X, Rest, Rest1).
