% Define a predicate for finding the length of a list
length([], 0). % Empty list has length of 0

% Define a predicate for finding the length of a non-empty list
length([_ | T], Len) :- % A list with head H and tail T has length of Len
    length(T, LenT), % Recursively find the length of the tail
    Len is LenT + 1. % The length of the list is one more than the length of the tail
