/*This code snippet demonstrates a rule for finding the minimum value in a list of integers*/

min_list([X],X). /*if list has only one element, that is the minimum value*/

min_list([H|T],Min) :- /*for a list with more than one element*/
    min_list(T,TMin),  /*recursive call to find minimum in tail of list*/
    (H < TMin         /*if head of list is smaller than minimum in tail*/
    -> Min = H        /*set minimum to head value*/
    ; Min = TMin).    /*otherwise, set minimum to minimum in tail*/

/*Example query and result:
?- min_list([5,3,7,9,1], Min).
Min = 1.
