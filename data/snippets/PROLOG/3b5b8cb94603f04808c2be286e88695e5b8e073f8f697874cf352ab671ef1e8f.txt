% A simple program to determine if a number is prime
% This code snippet defines a predicate to check if a number is prime
isPrime(2).                     % Base case: 2 is prime
isPrime(3).                     % Base case: 3 is prime
isPrime(P) :-
    integer(P),                 % Check if input is an integer
    P > 3,                      % Make sure input is greater than 3
    P mod 2 =\= 0,              % Check if input is not divisible by 2
    \+ hasFactor(P,3).          % Call the helper predicate to check for factors after 3
hasFactor(N,L) :-               % Helper predicate to check for factors
    N mod L =:= 0.              % Check if N is divisible by L
hasFactor(N,L) :-
    L * L < N,                  % Make sure L*L < N (to avoid unnecessary checks)
    L2 is L + 2,                % Increment L by 2 to skip even numbers
    hasFactor(N,L2).            % Recursive call with incremented L
