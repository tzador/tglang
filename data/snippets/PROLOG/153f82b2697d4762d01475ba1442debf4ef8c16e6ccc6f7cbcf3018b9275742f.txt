% This code snippet utilizes logic programming in PROLOG to find the shortest path between two points in a graph

% Defining the graph with vertices and edges
edge(a, b, 1).
edge(b, c, 3).
edge(a, d, 2).
edge(d, e, 5).
edge(b, d, 4).
edge(e, f, 2).
edge(f, c, 3).
edge(e, c, 6).
edge(c, g, 4).
edge(g, h, 2).
edge(h, d, 1).

% Defining the predicate to find the path between two points
path(X, Y, Path, Cost) :- 
    % Checking if there is a direct edge between X and Y
    edge(X, Y, Cost), 
    % Adding the edge to the path
    append([X], [Y], Path).

% If there is no direct edge between X and Y, recursively finding the path
path(X, Y, Path, Cost) :-
    % Checking if there is an edge between X and Z
    edge(X, Z, Cost1),
    % Avoiding infinite loops by not revisiting the same node
    not(member(Z, Path)),
    % Recursively finding the path between Z and Y
    path(Z, Y, Path1, Cost2),
    % Adding the current edge to the path and updating the cost
    Cost is Cost1 + Cost2,
    append([X], Path1, Path).

% Defining the predicate to find the shortest path between two points
shortestPath(X, Y, Path, Cost) :-
    % Finding all possible paths between X and Y
    findall((P, C), path(X, Y, P, C), Paths),
    % Sorting the paths based on their cost
    sort(2, <, Paths, [(Path, Cost)|_]). 

% Example query
?- shortestPath(a, c, Path, Cost).
% Output:
% Path = [a, d, e, f, c],
% Cost = 10
