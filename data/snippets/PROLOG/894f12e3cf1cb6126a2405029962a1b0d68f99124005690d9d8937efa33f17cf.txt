% Defining a rule for finding the length of a list
% Parameters:
%   List - the list whose length needs to be found
%   Length - variable to store the length of the list
length(List, Length) :- 
    % Base case: When list is empty, length is 0
    List = [], 
    Length is 0.

length(List, Length) :- 
    % Recursive case: Remove the first element from the list, 
    % call length on the rest of the list and increment Length
    List = [_|Tail], 
    length(Tail, SublistLength), 
    Length is SublistLength + 1.
