%Finding a path between two nodes in a directed graph

%Rules

path(X, Y, _) :- %checking if there is a direct edge between nodes
  arc(X, Y),
  write(X), nl.

path(X, Y, Visited_nodes) :- %checking if there is a path between nodes through other nodes
  arc(X, Z),
  not(member(Z, Visited_nodes)), %avoiding going back to visited nodes
  write(X), nl,
  path(Z, Y, [X | Visited_nodes]). %adding current node to visited list

%Facts

arc(a, b). %node a connects to node b
arc(b, c). %node b connects to node c
arc(b, d). %node b also connects to node d
arc(c, d). %node c also connects to node d
arc(c, e). %node c also connects to node e
arc(e, d). %node e connects to node d


%Query

path(a, d, []). %find path between node a and node d
