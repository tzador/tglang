% A Prolog program for checking if a given number is prime

% Defining a predicate for checking if a number is prime
prime_check(N) :-
	N < 2, !, fail. % If N is less than 2, it is not prime
prime_check(N) :-
	N = 2, !, true. % If N is 2, it is prime
prime_check(N) :-
	N mod 2 = 0, !, fail. % If N is divisible by 2, it is not prime
prime_check(N) :-
	N mod P = 0, % P is the possible divisor of N
	P > 2, % Ensuring that P is greater than 2
	P \= N, % Ensuring P is not equal to N
	prime_check(P). % Recursively checking if P is prime
prime_check(N). % If all above conditions fail, N is prime

% Query to check if 7 is prime
?- prime_check(7).
