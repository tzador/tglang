% This is a Prolog program that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph

% Defining the edges of the graph
edge(a, b, 5).
edge(b, c, 3).
edge(c, d, 6).
edge(d, e, 4).
edge(e, f, 7).
edge(f, g, 2).
edge(g, h, 8).
edge(h, i, 9).
edge(i, j, 1).
edge(j, k, 10).

% Finding the shortest path between two nodes
% shortest_path/3 takes in starting node, ending node, and an empty list as arguments
shortest_path(Node1, Node2, Path):- 
    shortest_path(Node1, Node2, [Node1], 0, Path).

% Base case
% If the starting node is the same as the ending node, then we have found the shortest path
shortest_path(Node, Node, Path, Distance, Path):-
    write('Distance: '), write(Distance).
    
% Recursive case
% If there is an edge between the current node and another node, and that node has not been visited yet
% We add this node to the path and calculate the new distance
% Then we recursively call shortest_path with this new path and updated distance
shortest_path(Node1, Node2, Visited, CurrentDistance, Path):-
    edge(Node1, NextNode, EdgeDistance),
    not(member(NextNode, Visited)),
    NewDistance is CurrentDistance + EdgeDistance,
    shortest_path(NextNode, Node2, [NextNode|Visited], NewDistance, Path).
