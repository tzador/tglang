%% This is a rule to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers
gcd(X,Y,D) :-       % Define a rule with three inputs
    X > Y,          % Check if X is greater than Y
    Z is X - Y,     % Subtract Y from X and store in Z
    gcd(Z, Y, D).   % Recursively call the rule with the new inputs
gcd(X,Y,D) :-
    Y > X,          % Check if Y is greater than X
    Z is Y - X,     % Subtract X from Y and store in Z
    gcd(X, Z, D).   % Recursively call the rule with the new inputs
gcd(X,X,X).         % If both inputs are equal, the GCD is the input itself
