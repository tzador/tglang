%%This code snippet is for creating a knowledge base in PROLOG
%%It defines different facts and rules to represent relationships between objects
%%and answers queries based on the information given in the knowledge base

%%Defining facts about objects
%%fact(Object 1, Object 2) denotes that Object 2 has some relationship with Object 1
fact(cat, mammal).
fact(dog, mammal).
fact(cheetah, carnivore).
fact(squirrel, herbivore).
%%fact(Object) denotes that Object is an individual entity
fact(daisy).
fact(rose).

%%Defining rules for determining relationships between objects
%%rule(Object 1, Object 2) denotes that Object 2 has a specific relationship with Object 1 based on certain conditions
%%to determine if Object 1 and Object 2 are in the same category
rule(Category, Object) :-
	fact(Object, Category).
%%to determine if Object 1 is a parent of Object 2
rule(Object 1, Object 2) :-
	fact(Object 1, Object 3),
	fact(Object 3, Object 2).
%%to determine if Object 1 is a cousin of Object 2
rule(Object 1, Object 2) :-
	fact(Object 1, Object 3),
	rule(Cousin, Object 3),
	fact(Object 2, Cousin).
%%to determine if Object 1 and Object 2 belong to the same category through a shared ancestor
rule(Category, Object 1, Object 2) :-
	rule(Object 1, Parent),
	rule(Object 2, Parent),
	fact(Parent, Category).

%%Defining queries to be answered based on the information in the knowledge base
%%?- fact(cat, mammal). outputs true, as this relationship is explicitly defined as a fact
%%?- rule(mammal, cat). outputs true, as this relationship can be inferred from the fact
%%?- fact(daisy, mammal). outputs false, as this fact is not defined in the knowledge base
%%?- rule(carnivore, cheetah). outputs true, as this relationship can be inferred from the fact
