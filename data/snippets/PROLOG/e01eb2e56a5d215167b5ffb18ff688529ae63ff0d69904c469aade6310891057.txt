%% Define a rule to check if a list is in ascending order
check_ascending([]). % Base case: empty list is already in ascending order
check_ascending([_]). % Base case: list with one element is already in ascending order
check_ascending([X,Y|T]):- % Recursive rule: check first two elements and recurse on the rest
    X =< Y, % First element is less than or equal to second element
    check_ascending([Y|T]). % Recurse on rest of the list
