% Define a predicate for calculating the factorial of a given number

factorial(0,1). % Base case, 0! = 1

factorial(N, Result) :-
  N > 0, % Ensures that N is a positive integer
  N1 is N - 1, % Calculates the factorial of the previous number
  factorial(N1, R1), % Recursive call to get the factorial of N1
  Result is N * R1. % Calculates factorial of N

% Example query
?- factorial(5, Result).
% Expected output: Result = 120.
