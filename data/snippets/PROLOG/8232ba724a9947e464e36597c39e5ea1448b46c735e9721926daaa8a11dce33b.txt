%% This code snippet creates a function that calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
fib(0, 0).  % Base case for 0th term, returns 0
fib(1, 1).  % Base case for 1st term, returns 1
fib(N, Result) :- N > 1, % If N is greater than 1, proceed with calculation
    N1 is N - 1,         % Calculate N-1th term
    N2 is N - 2,         % Calculate N-2th term
    fib(N1, R1),         % Recursively calculate N-1th term
    fib(N2, R2),         % Recursively calculate N-2th term
    Result is R1 + R2.   % Calculate nth term using previous results
