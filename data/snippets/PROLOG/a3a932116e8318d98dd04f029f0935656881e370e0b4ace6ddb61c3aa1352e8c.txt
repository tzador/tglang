% Define a predicate for finding the HCF of two numbers
hcf(X, 0, X). % If second number is 0, HCF is the first number
hcf(X, Y, Z) :- Y > 0, % If second number is greater than 0
                R is X mod Y, % Remainder of X/Y
                hcf(Y, R, Z). % Recursively call hcf with Y and R to find HCF
