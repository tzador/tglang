% Create a factorial predicate in Prolog
factorial(0, 1). % Base case: the factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, Result):- % Recursive case: the factorial of N is equal to N multiplied by the factorial of N-1
    N > 0, % Ensure that N is a positive integer
    NewN is N - 1, % Calculate the factorial of N-1
    factorial(NewN, SubResult), % Call factorial recursively
    Result is N * SubResult. % Calculate the final result

% Example query: factorial(5, X).
% Output: X = 120
