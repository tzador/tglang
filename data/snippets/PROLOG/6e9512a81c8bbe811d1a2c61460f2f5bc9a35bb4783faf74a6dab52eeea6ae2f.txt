% The following code snippet creates a knowledge base of family relationships in a Prolog program

parent(john, mary). % John is the parent of Mary
parent(mary, bill). % Mary is the parent of Bill
parent(mary, lisa). % Mary is the parent of Lisa
parent(bill, steve). % Bill is the parent of Steve

male(john). % John is a male
male(bill). % Bill is a male
male(steve). % Steve is a male

female(mary). % Mary is a female
female(lisa). % Lisa is a female

% The following rules define the relationships between different family members
% X is the father of Y if X is a male parent of Y
father(X,Y) :-
    parent(X,Y),
    male(X).

% X is the mother of Y if X is a female parent of Y
mother(X,Y) :-
    parent(X,Y),
    female(X).

% X is the grandparent of Y if X is a parent of Z and Z is a parent of Y
grandparent(X,Y) :-
    parent(X,Z),
    parent(Z,Y).

% X is the sibling of Y if they have at least one common parent
sibling(X,Y) :-
    parent(Z,X),
    parent(Z,Y),
    X \= Y. % X is not the same as Y

% X is the aunt of Y if X is the sister of Z and Z is the parent of Y
aunt(X,Y) :-
    sister(X,Z),
    parent(Z,Y).

% X is the uncle of Y if X is the brother of Z and Z is the parent of Y
uncle(X,Y) :-
    brother(X,Z),
    parent(Z,Y).

% The following clauses define the rules for sister, brother, and grandchild relationships
% Sister relationship
sister(X,Y) :-
    female(X), % X is female
    parent(Z,X), % Z is the parent of X
    parent(Z,Y), % Z is also the parent of Y
    X \= Y. % X is not the same as Y

% Brother relationship
brother(X,Y) :-
    male(X), % X is male
    parent(Z,X), % Z is the parent of X
    parent(Z,Y), % Z is also the parent of Y
    X \= Y. % X is not the same as Y

% Grandchild relationship
grandchild(X,Y) :-
    parent(Y,Z), % Y is the parent of Z
    parent(Z,X). % Z is the parent of X, therefore Y is the grandparent of X
