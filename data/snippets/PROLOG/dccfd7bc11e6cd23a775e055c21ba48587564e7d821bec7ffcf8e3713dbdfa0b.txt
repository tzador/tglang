%% Define a rule to calculate the factorial of a number

factorial(0,1).         %% factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N,F) :-       %% factorial of N is F if
  N>0,                  %% N is greater than 0 and
  N1 is N-1,            %% N1 is N minus 1 and
  factorial(N1,F1),     %% F1 is the factorial of N1 and
  F is N * F1.          %% F is N times F1

%% Output:
%% factorial(5,X).
%% X = 120
