% This is a Prolog program that implements a basic calculator.
% It takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and calculates the result.

% Define the predicates for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

add(X, Y, Z) :- Z is X + Y.
subtract(X, Y, Z) :- Z is X - Y.
multiply(X, Y, Z) :- Z is X * Y.
divide(X, Y, Z) :- Z is X / Y.

% Define the predicate for the calculator, which takes in two numbers and an operator as input.

calculator(X, Y, Operator, Result) :-
    % Check if the operator is valid.
    (Operator = '+', add(X, Y, Result));
    (Operator = '-', subtract(X, Y, Result));
    (Operator = '*', multiply(X, Y, Result));
    (Operator = '/', divide(X, Y, Result)).

% Sample query: calculator(5, 2, *, Result).
% Output: Result = 10.
