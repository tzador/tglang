% This is a program to find the factorial of a number

% Define the predicate "factorial" with two arguments, the number and its factorial
factorial(0, 1).

% Define the base case for the recursion, where the factorial of 0 is 1

% Define the recursive case for the predicate "factorial", where the factorial of a number is equal to that number times the factorial of its predecessor
factorial(N, Result) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N-1,
    factorial(N1, Res1),
    Result is N * Res1.

% Define a helper predicate "print_factorial" with one argument, the number, to print the factorial of that number
print_factorial(N) :-
    write('Factorial of '),
    write(N),
    write(' is '),
    factorial(N, Res),
    write(Res).

% Call the "print_factorial" predicate with a given number as argument
:- initialization(print_factorial(5)).

% Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
