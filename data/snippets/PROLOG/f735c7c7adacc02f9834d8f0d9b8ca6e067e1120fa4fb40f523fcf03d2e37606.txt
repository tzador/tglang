%% Defining a predicate named 'sum' with three parameters
sum(X, Y, Z) :- 
    %% Assigning 'Z' to the sum of 'X' and 'Y'
    Z is X + Y.

%% Defining a predicate named 'factorial' with two parameters
factorial(N, F) :-
    %% Checking if 'N' is equal to 0, if yes, then 'F' is assigned to 1
    N = 0,
    F is 1.

factorial(N, F) :-
    %% If 'N' is not equal to 0, then 'F' is assigned to 'N' multiplied by 'F1'
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    factorial(N1, F1),
    F is N * F1.
