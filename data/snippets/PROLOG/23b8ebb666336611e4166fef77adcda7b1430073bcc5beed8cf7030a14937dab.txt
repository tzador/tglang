/* This is a Prolog predicate that calculates the factorial of a given number */
factorial(0, 1). /* Base case: 0! = 1 */
factorial(N, R) :- /* Recursive case */
    N > 0, /* Ensure N is a positive number */
    N1 is N - 1, /* Calculate N-1 for recursive call */
    factorial(N1, R1), /* Recursive call */
    R is N * R1. /* Calculate factorial by multiplying N with factorial of N-1 */
