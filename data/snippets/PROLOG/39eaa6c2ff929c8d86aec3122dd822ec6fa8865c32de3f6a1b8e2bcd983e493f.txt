% Defining a predicate for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers

gcd(X,Y,G):-
    X =:= Y,    % If X and Y are equal, then GCD is found
    G is X.
gcd(X,Y,G):-
    X > Y,      % If X is greater than Y, then call gcd with arguments Y and X
    Z is X - Y, % Get the difference between X and Y
    gcd(Z,Y,G). % Call gcd recursively with arguments Z and Y
gcd(X,Y,G):-
    X < Y,      % If X is less than Y, then call gcd with arguments X and Y
    Z is Y - X, % Get the difference between Y and X
    gcd(X,Z,G). % Call gcd recursively with arguments X and Z

% Example query
?- gcd(24,36,G).
% Output: G = 12
