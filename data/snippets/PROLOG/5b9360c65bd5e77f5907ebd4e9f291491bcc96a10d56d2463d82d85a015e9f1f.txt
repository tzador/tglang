% Defining a list length predicate that takes in a list and outputs its length
listLength([],0). % If the list is empty, its length is 0
listLength([_|Tail],Length) :- % If list is not empty, split into head and tail
    listLength(Tail,TailLength), % Recursively calculate the length of the tail
    Length is TailLength + 1. % Add 1 to the tail length to get the total list length
