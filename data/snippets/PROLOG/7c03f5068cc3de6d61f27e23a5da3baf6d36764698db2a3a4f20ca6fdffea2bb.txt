% This is a Prolog program that finds the maximum element in a list.

% Defining the base case for an empty list
maximum([], 0).

% Defining the recursive case
% If the list has only one element, then it is the maximum
maximum([X], X).

% If the first element is greater than the maximum of the rest of the list,
% then it is the new maximum
maximum([X | T], X) :-
    maximum(T, M),
    X > M.

% If the maximum of the rest of the list is greater than the first element,
% then it is still the maximum
maximum([X | T], M) :-
    maximum(T, M),
    X =< M.
