%% Define the factorial predicate
factorial(0,1). % Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N,F) :- N > 0, % Recursive case: N is greater than 0
		   N1 is N-1, % Decrement N by 1
		   factorial(N1,F1), % Call the factorial predicate with N1
		   F is N * F1. % F is the factorial of N
%% Output:
% factorial(0,1)
% true.
%
% factorial(3,F)
% F = 6.
