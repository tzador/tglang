/* Define a predicate that finds the length of a list
and returns it as an output */

length([],0). /* base case: an empty list has a length of 0 */ 
length([_|T],N) :- length(T,N1), N is N1+1. /* recursive case: a list with at least one element
has a length of one more than the length of its tail */
