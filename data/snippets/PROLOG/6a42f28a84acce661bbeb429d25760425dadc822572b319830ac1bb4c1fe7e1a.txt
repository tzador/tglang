% This is a simple rule that checks if X is a prime number
check_prime(X) :- 
    % Checks if X is greater than 1
    X > 1, 
    % Gets all numbers from 2 to X-1
    generate_list(X, List), 
    % Checks if X is divisible by any number in the list
    \+ (member(Y, List), X mod Y =:= 0). 

% This is a helper rule that generates a list from 2 to X-1
generate_list(X, []) :- 
    % Base case: when X is 2, list is empty
    X =< 2.
generate_list(X, [X | List]) :- 
    % Add X to the list
    X1 is X - 1, 
    % Call the helper rule with X-1
    generate_list(X1, List).
    
% Example query to check if 7 is prime
?- check_prime(7).
% Output:
% true.
