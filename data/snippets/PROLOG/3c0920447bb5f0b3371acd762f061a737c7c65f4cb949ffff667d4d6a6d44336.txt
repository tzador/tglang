% Finds the maximum element in a list
maximum([X], X). % Base case - the maximum element of a single-element list is the element itself
maximum([H|T], H) :- maximum(T, M), H >= M. % Recursive case - if the head of the list (H) is greater than or equal to the maximum of the rest of the list (M), then H is the maximum
maximum([H|T], M) :- maximum(T, M), H < M. % Recursive case - if the head of the list (H) is less than the maximum of the rest of the list (M), then M is still the maximum
