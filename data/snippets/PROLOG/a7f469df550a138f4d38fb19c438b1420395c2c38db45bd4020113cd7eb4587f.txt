% This is a simple Prolog program that implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers
% The code uses recursion to repeatedly subtract the smaller number from the larger number until they are equal, then that number is the GCD

% Base case: if the two numbers are equal, then that number is the GCD
gcd(X, X, X).

% Recursive case: if X > Y, then subtract Y from X, otherwise subtract X from Y
gcd(X, Y, GCD) :-
    X > Y,
    Z is X - Y,
    gcd(Z, Y, GCD).
gcd(X, Y, GCD) :-
    X =< Y,
    Z is Y - X,
    gcd(Z, X, GCD).
