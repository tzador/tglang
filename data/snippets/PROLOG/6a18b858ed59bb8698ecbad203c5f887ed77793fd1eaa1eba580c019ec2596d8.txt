%% Define a rule for calculating the factorial of a number.
factorial(0, 1). %% Base case: factorial of 0 is 1.

%% Define a recursive rule for calculating the factorial of a number.
factorial(N, F) :-
    N > 0, %% Check if N is greater than 0.
    N1 is N - 1, %% Decrement N by 1.
    factorial(N1, F1), %% Calculate factorial of N1.
    F is N * F1. %% Multiply N by factorial of N1 to get factorial of N.
