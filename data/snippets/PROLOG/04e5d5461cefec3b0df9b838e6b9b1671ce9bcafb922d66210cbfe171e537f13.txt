%% Defining a predicate to find the factorials of a given number
factorial(0, 1). % Base case, 0! = 1
factorial(N, F) :- N > 0, % Recursion, if N is greater than 0
    N1 is N - 1, % Decrease N by 1 for next iteration
    factorial(N1, F1), % Recursive call to factorial with decreased N
    F is N * F1. % Calculate factorial of N and keep updating it until N reaches 0

?- factorial(5, F). % Query to find factorial of 5
F = 120. % Output of the query, 5! = 120
