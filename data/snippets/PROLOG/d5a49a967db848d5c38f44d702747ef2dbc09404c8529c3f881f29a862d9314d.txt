%% Define a predicate for finding the factorial of a number
factorial(0,1).                 % Factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, Res) :-            % Define the factorial rule
	N > 0,                      % Condition for positive integers
	N1 is N-1,                  % Calculate N-1
	factorial(N1,Res1),         % Recursively find the factorial of N-1
	Res is N*Res1.              % Calculate the factorial of N

?- factorial(5,Res).            % Query the predicate with a number
% Output: Res = 120.            % Print the result when factorial is called with 5 as input
