% Define a predicate that checks if two lists have the same length
% and returns a boolean value

equal_length([], []). % Base case: empty lists have the same length
equal_length([_|T1], [_|T2]):- % Recursive case: remove first element from both lists and check remaining elements
    equal_length(T1, T2). % Recursively call equal_length on the remaining elements
