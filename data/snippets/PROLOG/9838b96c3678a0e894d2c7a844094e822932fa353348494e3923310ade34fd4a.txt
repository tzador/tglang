%% defining a rule "factorial" to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial(N, Fact) :-
  N > 0,
  N1 is N - 1,
  factorial(N1, Subfact),
  Fact is N * Subfact.
%% N is the input number, Fact is the calculated factorial
factorial(0, 1).
%% base case: factorial of 0 is 1
%% querying the rule with input of 5
?- factorial(5, Fact).
%% expected output: 
%% Fact = 120
