% Declare a predicate "factorial" with two arguments, first argument being the number to find factorial of and the second argument being the result
/* A comment in PROLOG can be written with a percentage sign (%) at the beginning.*/
/* The first line of a PROLOG program must declare all the predicates and parameters being used.*/
factorial(0,1).
/* The base case for the factorial of 0 is 1. */
factorial(N,F) :- N>0, NewN is N-1, factorial(NewN,NewF), F is N*NewF.
/* The recursive case for finding factorial of a number is multiplying the number by the factorial of one less.*/
/* The condition for the recursive case is that the number must be greater than 0.*/
/* The variable NewN is used to reduce the value of N by 1 for each recursive call.*/
/* The variables NewF and F store the factorial of NewN and N respectively.*/
