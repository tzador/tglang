% This code snippet is a simple calculator that takes in two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

calculate(Num1, Num2, Operation, Result) :-
    (Operation =:= '+' ->
        Result is Num1 + Num2 ;
    Operation =:= '-' ->
        Result is Num1 - Num2 ;
    Operation =:= '*' ->
        Result is Num1 * Num2 ;
    Operation =:= '/' ->
        Result is Num1 / Num2).
