% This is a comment in PROLOG, denoted by '%'

% The following is a rule
rule(A, B) :-
    fact(A),           % B is fact A
    fact(B),           % B is a fact
    A =\= B.           % A is not equal to B

% The following is a query
?- rule(A, B).

% The following is a database of facts
fact(1).
fact(2).
fact(3).
fact(4).

% The following is a metarule
metarule([P, Q], [P, Q, P]). % P and Q are variables
% This metarule can generate new rules with three literals

% The following is an example of using the metarule to generate a new rule
?- metarule(P, Q), rule(Q, R),           % P and Q are inputs
   not rule(P, R),                       % Check if the new rule already exists
   assert(rule(P, R)).                   % Add the new rule to the database
