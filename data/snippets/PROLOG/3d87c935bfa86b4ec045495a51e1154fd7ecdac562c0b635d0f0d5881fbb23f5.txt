%% Define a predicate to check if a given number is even or odd
check_even_odd(Number) :- 
    % Use built-in predicate 'mod' to check if remainder of number divided by 2 is 0
    mod(Number, 2) =:= 0 -> 
        % If remainder is 0, print that number is even
        writeln(Number, 'is even');  
    mod(Number, 2) =:= 1 -> 
        % If remainder is 1, print that number is odd
        writeln(Number, 'is odd'); 
    % If neither condition is met, print that the number is invalid
    writeln(Number, 'is neither even nor odd').
