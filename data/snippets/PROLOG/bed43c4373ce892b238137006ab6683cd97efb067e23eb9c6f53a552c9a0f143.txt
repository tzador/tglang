% This is a predicate in PROLOG that takes in two parameters, a list and an empty list,
% and reverses the order of the elements in the list.
reverse_list([], []). % If the input list is empty, the output list will also be empty.
reverse_list([Head|Tail], New_List) :- % If the input list is not empty, the head of the list will be
                                       % the first element in the new list, and we will recurse
                                       % through the tail of the input list.
    reverse_list(Tail, Temp_List),     % Recursively call reverse_list on the tail of the input list.
    append(Temp_List, [Head], New_List). % Append the head to the temporary list to create the new list.

% Example query and output:
% ?- reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], Result).
% Result = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
