% This is a Prolog program that implements a knowledge base for a simple quiz game.

%---------------------------------------
% Definitions of facts and predicates
%---------------------------------------

% Facts describing the different types of questions, along with their answers.
% For example, the question 'What is the capital of France?' has the answer 'Paris'.
question('What is the capital of France?', 'Paris').
question('How many days are there in a leap year?', '366').
question('What is the square root of 144?', '12').

% A predicate to check if a given answer is correct for a given question.
% Uses the built-in predicate '=' to compare the given answer with the actual answer.
is_correct(Question, Answer) :-
    question(Question, ActualAnswer),
    Answer = ActualAnswer.

% A predicate that starts the quiz game by printing the first question and getting the user's input.
start :-
    write('Welcome to the Prolog quiz game!'),
    question(Question, _),
    write(Question),
    read(Input),
    process_answer(Question, Input).

% A predicate that processes the user's input for a given question.
process_answer(Question, Answer) :-
    is_correct(Question, Answer),
    write('Correct!'),
    start. % This will start the game again and ask the next question.
process_answer(Question, _) :-
    write('Sorry, that was incorrect. The correct answer is:'),
    question(Question, CorrectAnswer),
    write(CorrectAnswer),
    start. % This will start the game again and ask the next question.
