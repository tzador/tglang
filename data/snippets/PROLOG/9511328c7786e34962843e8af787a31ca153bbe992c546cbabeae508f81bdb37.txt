% Rules for finding the minimum element in a list
find_min([X], X). % Base case: the minimum element of a list with only one element is the element itself
find_min([X,Y|Tail], Min) :- % For a list with two or more elements,
    X =< Y, % if the first element is less than or equal to the second element,
    find_min([X|Tail], Min). % find the minimum of the first element and the rest of the list
find_min([X,Y|Tail], Min) :- % For a list with two or more elements,
    X > Y, % if the first element is greater than the second element,
    find_min([Y|Tail], Min). % find the minimum of the second element and the rest of the list
