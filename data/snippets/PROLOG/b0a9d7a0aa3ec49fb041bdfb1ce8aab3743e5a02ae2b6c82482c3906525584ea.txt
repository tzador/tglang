% Define the predicate "factorial" with two parameters, "N" and "Result"
factorial(N, Result) :-
    % If N is equal to 0, then Result is set to 1
    N =:= 0,
    Result is 1.

% If N is not equal to 0, then calculate the factorial using recursion
factorial(N, Result) :-
    N > 0,
    % Define a temporary variable "Tmp" and call the factorial predicate with N-1 and assign it to Tmp
    Tmp is N - 1,
    factorial(Tmp, SubResult),
    % Multiply N with the SubResult and assign it to Result
    Result is N * SubResult.
