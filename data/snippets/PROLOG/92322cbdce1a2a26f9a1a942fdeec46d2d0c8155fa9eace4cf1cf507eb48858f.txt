% A Prolog program to find the factorial of a number
factorial(0, 1).  % base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, F) :-
    N > 0,  % recursive case: factorial of N is N times factorial of N-1
    N1 is N - 1,  % reduce N by 1 in each recursion
    factorial(N1, F1),  % calculate factorial of N-1
    F is N * F1.  % multiply N and factorial of N-1 to get factorial of N
