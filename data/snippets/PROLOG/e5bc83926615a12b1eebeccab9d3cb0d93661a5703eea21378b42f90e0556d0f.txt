% Define a predicate for calculating the factorial of a number
% The first argument is the number to calculate the factorial of
% The second argument is the result of the factorial
% This predicate uses tail recursion for efficiency

factorial(0, 1). % Base case, factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, Res) :-
    N > 0, % Make sure input number is positive
    N1 is N - 1, % Decrement input number
    factorial(N1, Res1), % Calculate factorial of decremented input
    Res is N * Res1. % Multiply input number by factorial of decremented input to get final result
