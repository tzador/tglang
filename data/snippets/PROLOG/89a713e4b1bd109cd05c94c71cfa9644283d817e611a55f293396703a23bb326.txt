% A recursive predicate to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial(0, 1). % Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(X, Y) :-
    X > 0, % Check if X is greater than 0
    X1 is X - 1, % Decrement X by 1
    factorial(X1, Y1), % Recursively call factorial with X1 and Y1
    Y is X * Y1. % Multiply X and Y1 to get Y as the factorial of X
