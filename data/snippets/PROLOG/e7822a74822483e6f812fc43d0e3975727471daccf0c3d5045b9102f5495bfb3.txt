% A program that checks if a number is a perfect square
% perfect_square(N) checks if N is a perfect square
perfect_square(0). % 0 is a perfect square
perfect_square(N) :- % N is a perfect square if its square root is a whole number
    N > 0, % N must be a positive number
    S is sqrt(N), % S is the square root of N
    integer(S). % S must be an integer

% Example use:
?- perfect_square(25).
% returns true since 25 is a perfect square (5 * 5 = 25)

?- perfect_square(30).
% returns false since 30 is not a perfect square
