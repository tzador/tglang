% This is a Prolog program that defines a predicate for determining if a given list is a palindrome

is_palindrome(List) :-
    reverse(List, List).

reverse([], []). % Base case: An empty list reversed is still an empty list
reverse([Head|Tail], Reversed) :-
    reverse(Tail, ReversedTail), % Call reverse recursively on the tail of the list
    append(ReversedTail, [Head], Reversed). % Append the head to the reversed tail to get the reversed list

/*
Explanation:
- The is_palindrome predicate takes in a list as a parameter (denoted by the variable List)
- The reverse predicate is used within the is_palindrome predicate to check if the given list is equal to its reversed form
- The reverse predicate itself is defined recursively: the first clause states that an empty list reversed is also an empty list
- The second clause states that for a non-empty list, the head (first element) is appended to the reversed version of the tail (the rest of the list)
- This process repeats until the entire list is reversed, and the final result is stored in the Reversed variable
- Thus, if the reversed list is equal to the original list, the is_palindrome predicate will evaluate to true, signifying that the list is a palindrome
