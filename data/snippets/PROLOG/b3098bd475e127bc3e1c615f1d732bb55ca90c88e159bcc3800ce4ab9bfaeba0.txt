% This is a prolog program that checks whether a given number is prime or not

% First, we define a predicate that checks if a number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number
divisible(X,Y) :- X mod Y =:= 0. % check if X is divisible by Y
divisible(X,Y) :- Y*Y < X, Y2 is Y+1, divisible(X,Y2). % recursively check if X is divisible by any number from 2 to square root of X


% Next, we define a predicate that checks if the given number is prime by checking if it is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number
is_prime(X) :- X > 1, not(divisible(X,2)). % check if X is not divisible by 2
is_prime(X) :- X mod 2 =\= 0, Y is 3, divisible(X,Y). % check if X is not divisible by any odd number from 3 to square root of X


% Finally, we can query the program to check if a given number is prime or not
?- is_prime(7). % query if 7 is prime
true. % since 7 is prime, the output is true

?- is_prime(12). % query if 12 is prime
false. % since 12 is not prime, the output is false
