% This is a Prolog program that defines a predicate to find the sum of the first N natural numbers
% Input:
% N: the last natural number
% Sum: the sum of the first N natural numbers
% Output:
% Sum: the calculated sum
%----------------------------------------------
% Base case: when N is 1
sum_of_nat(1, 1).

% Recursive case: when N is greater than 1
sum_of_nat(N, Sum) :-
    N > 1,
    Prev is N - 1,  % calculate previous natural number
    sum_of_nat(Prev, Temp),  % recursively calculate sum of previous number
    Sum is Temp + N.  % sum current number with previous sum and assign to Sum variable

% Sample query:
% ?- sum_of_nat(5, X).
% Output:
% X = 15
