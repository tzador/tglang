%% Declare a predicate for calculating the factorial of a number
factorial(0,1).  % Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N,F) :-  % Recursive case
    N>0,  % Make sure N is a positive number
    N1 is N-1,  % Calculate N-1 for the recursive call
    factorial(N1,F1),  % Recursive call to factorial
    F is N*F1. % Calculate factorial of N by multiplying N with factorial of N-1

/*
Example query:
?- factorial(5, F).
F = 120.  % Output: factorial of 5 is 120
