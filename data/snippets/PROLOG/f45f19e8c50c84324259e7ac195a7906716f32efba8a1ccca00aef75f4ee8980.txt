% This is a Prolog program that defines the parent-child relationship.
% It takes in the parent-child pairs and provides the parent-child relation for all pairs.

% Define the parent-child relationship predicate
parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y). % X is the parent of Y if X is the mother of Y
parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y). % X is the parent of Y if X is the father of Y

% Define the mother-child relationship predicate
mother(michelle, john). % Michelle is the mother of John
mother(michelle, emma). % Michelle is the mother of Emma
mother(lisa, alex). % Lisa is the mother of Alex
mother(sarah, jenna). % Sarah is the mother of Jenna

% Define the father-child relationship predicate
father(john, david). % John is the father of David
father(john, sarah). % John is the father of Sarah
father(daniel, emma). % Daniel is the father of Emma
father(daniel, alex). % Daniel is the father of Alex

% Query all parent-child pairs and display the relationships
?- parent(X, Y). % X is the parent of Y
% Output: X = michelle, Y = john ;
%         X = michelle, Y = emma ;
%         X = lisa, Y = alex ;
%         X = sarah, Y = jenna ;
%         X = john, Y = david ;
%         X = john, Y = sarah ;
%         X = daniel, Y = emma ;
%         X = daniel, Y = alex.
