/* 
Explanation: 
- The program defines a predicate "prime" that takes in a number 'N' and checks if it is prime or not. 
- If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is automatically not prime and the predicate returns false. 
- If the number is equal to 2, it is prime and the predicate returns true. 
- If the number is greater than 2, the program calls the helper predicate "prime" with the number and a starting value of 2. 
- The helper predicate checks if 'N' is divisible by any number between 2 and 'N-1'. 
- If it finds a number that divides 'N' with 0 remainder, it returns false indicating that the number is not prime. 
- If it reaches the end of the helper predicate without finding such number, it means 'N' is prime and the predicate returns true.
