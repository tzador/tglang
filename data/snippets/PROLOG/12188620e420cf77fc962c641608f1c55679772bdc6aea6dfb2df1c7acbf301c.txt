/* Declaring a predicate to find the maximum of two numbers */

    A >= B,            % condition: A is greater than or equal to B
    C is A.            % assigning value of A to C since it is the maximum

    B > A,             % condition: B is greater than A
    C is B.            % assigning value of B to C since it is the maximum

% X = 10.              % output: X is assigned the maximum value which is 10

% X = 5.               % output: X is assigned the maximum value which is 5 (since A >= B condition is true)
