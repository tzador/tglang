% This is a Prolog program that defines rules for determining the highest common factor of two numbers.
 
% First, we define a rule for determining the highest common factor of X and 0, which is always X.
hcf(X,0,X).

% Next, we define a rule for determining the highest common factor of X and Y.
% This rule uses recursion to continuously find the remainder of X and Y until the remainder is 0.
% The final remainder will be the highest common factor.
hcf(X,Y,H) :- Y > 0, R is X mod Y, hcf(Y,R,H).

% Sample query: hcf(24, 36, H).
% Sample output: H = 12.
