% Define a rule for finding the highest common factor of two numbers
hcf(X, Y, Z) :- X =:= Y, Z is X. % If the numbers are equal, the HCF is the number itself
hcf(X, Y, Z) :- X > Y, hcf(X-Y, Y, Z). % If X is greater than Y, subtract Y from X and recurse
hcf(X, Y, Z) :- X < Y, hcf(Y-X, X, Z). % If Y is greater than X, subtract X from Y and recurse
/*
Example query:
?- hcf(12, 18, Z).
Z = 6.
Explanation: This query will find the highest common factor of 12 and 18, which is 6.
