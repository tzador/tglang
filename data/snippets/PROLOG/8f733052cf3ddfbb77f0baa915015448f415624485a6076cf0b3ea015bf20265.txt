% This is a code snippet in PROLOG that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph
% It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distance and path

% Define a predicate to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph
shortest_path(Start, End, Path, Distance) :-
    dijkstra(Start, End, [], Path, Distance).

% Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance and path
% It takes in the current node, the end node, the visited nodes, the current path, and the current distance
dijkstra(Start, End, Visited, Path, Distance) :-
    % Check if the current node is the end node
    Start = End,
    % Set the path and distance to the current path and distance
    Path = [End],
    Distance = 0.

% If the current node has not been visited yet
dijkstra(Start, End, Visited, Path, Distance) :-
    % Calculate the distance from the current node to all its neighboring nodes
    findall(Distance, (adjacent(Start, Next, Distance)), Distances),
    % Select the shortest distance
    min_list(Distances, ShortestDistance),
    % Find the corresponding node for the shortest distance
    adjacent(Start, Next, ShortestDistance),
    % Check if the next node has been visited already or is the current node
    not(member(Next, Visited)),
    % Add the next node to the visited nodes
    append([Next], Visited, NewVisited),
    % Calculate the new distance
    NewDistance is Distance + ShortestDistance,
    % Recursively call dijkstra with the next node as the current node, the new visited nodes, and the current path
    dijkstra(Next, End, NewVisited, NewPath, NewDistance),
    % Set the path to the current node followed by the new path
    Path = [Start|NewPath],
    % Set the distance to the shortest distance plus the new distance
    Distance is ShortestDistance + NewDistance.

% Define a predicate to check if two nodes are adjacent in the graph
adjacent(Node1, Node2, Distance) :-
    % Check if there is an edge between the two nodes
    edge(Node1, Node2, Distance).
% If the edge is directed, also check if there is a reverse edge
adjacent(Node1, Node2, Distance) :-
    edge(Node2, Node1, Distance).
