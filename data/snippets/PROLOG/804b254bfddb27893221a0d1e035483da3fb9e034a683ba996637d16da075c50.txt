% This is a comment in PROLOG, denoted by the '%' symbol.

% We first define the 'factorial' predicate, which takes in two arguments,
% a number 'N' and the factorial of that number 'F', which will be returned.
factorial(N, F) :-
   % The first rule specifies the factorial of 0 as 1.
   N =:= 0,
   F is 1.

% The next rule calculates the factorial by recursively calling the factorial
% predicate for the number one less than the original number, and multiplying
% it with the original number.
factorial(N, F) :-
   N > 0,
   N1 is N - 1,
   factorial(N1, F1),
   F is N * F1.
