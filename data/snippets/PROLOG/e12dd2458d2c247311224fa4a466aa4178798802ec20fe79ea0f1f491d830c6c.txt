% Definition of a complex predicate
complex_pred(X, Y) :-
    (X > 0 -> % If X is greater than 0
        Y is X * X ; % Y is X squared
        Y is X + 5). % Otherwise, Y is X plus 5
        
/**
This code snippet defines a complex predicate in PROLOG that takes in two variables X and Y.
The predicate first checks if X is greater than 0 using an if-else statement.
If X is greater than 0, Y is assigned the value of X squared.
If X is not greater than 0, Y is assigned the value of X plus 5.
The predicate can be called by passing in any two variables and will return the appropriate value for Y based on the value of X.
