% This is a Prolog program that solves logic puzzles

% Defining the puzzle predicates
% First predicate - Mother

mother(alice, jack).
mother(alice, emma).
mother(alice, luke).
mother(emma, mila).
mother(emma, ben).
mother(luke, june).
mother(luke, gina).
mother(june, ryan).

% Second predicate - Father

father(bob, jack).
father(bob, emma).
father(bob, luke).
father(rick, mila).
father(rick, ben).
father(jack, june).
father(jack, gina).
father(luke, ryan).

% Third predicate - Sibling

sibling(X, Y) :- mother(Z, X), mother(Z, Y), father(W, X), father(W, Y), X\=Y.

% Fourth predicate - Grandparent

grandparent(X, Z) :- mother(X, Y), father(Y, Z).
grandparent(X, Z) :- father(X, Y), mother(Y, Z).

% Fifth predicate - Uncle

uncle(X, Y) :- father(Z, Y), sibling(Z, X).
uncle(X, Y) :- father(Z, Y), sibling(Z, W), father(W, X), W\=Z.

% Solving the puzzle
% Finding the grandparent of Ryan
?- grandparent(X, ryan).

% Output: X = alice ; X = bob ; X = rick. 
% This means that alice, bob, and rick are all possible grandparents of Ryan.
% Finding the uncle of Ryan
?- uncle(X, ryan).

% Output: X = june ; X = gina.
% This means that both june and gina are possible uncles of Ryan.
