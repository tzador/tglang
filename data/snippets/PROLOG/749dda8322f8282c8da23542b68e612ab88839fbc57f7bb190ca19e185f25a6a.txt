% This is a sample Prolog code snippet
% Define a predicate that checks if two numbers are equal
equal(X, X).  % This predicate will succeed when both inputs are the same number
% Define a predicate that adds two numbers
add(X, Y, Z) :-  % This predicate has three arguments - X and Y are the numbers to be added, Z is the resulting sum
    equal(X, 0),  % if X is equal to 0, the sum is equal to Y
    Z is Y.
add(X, Y, Z) :-  % if X is greater than 0, the sum is equal to X added to Y
    X > 0,
    X1 is X - 1,  % decrement X by 1
    add(X1, Y, Z1),  % recursively call add with X1 and Y to get the sum Z1
    Z is Z1 + 1.  % increment Z1 by 1 to get the final sum Z
