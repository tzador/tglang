%% Define a predicate that checks if a list of numbers is in ascending order
%% `asc_list/1` takes in one argument, a list of numbers
asc_list([]).   % If list is empty, it is in ascending order
asc_list([X]).  % If list has one element, it is also in ascending order
asc_list([X,Y|Z]) :- X =< Y, asc_list([Y|Z]).  % Checks if first two elements are in order and then recursively checks the rest of the list
