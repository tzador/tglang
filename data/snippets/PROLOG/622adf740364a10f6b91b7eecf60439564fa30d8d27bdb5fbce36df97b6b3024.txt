% Declare a predicate to check if X is divisible by Y
% divisible(X, Y) checks if X is divisible by Y
divisible(X, Y) :-
    X mod Y =:= 0.  /* Checks if the remainder of X divided by Y is equal to 0 */
    
% Declare a predicate to check if X is a prime number
% prime(X) checks if X is a prime number
prime(X) :-
    X > 1, /* Checks if X is greater than 1 */
    not(( /* Checks if the following statement is NOT true */
        between(2, X, Y), /* Checks if Y is a number between 2 and X */
        divisible(X, Y) /* Checks if X is divisible by Y */
    )). /* Checks if the statement in the brackets is NOT true */
    
% Declare a predicate to find the factorial of X
% factorial(X, Y) finds the factorial of X and stores it in Y
factorial(0, 1). /* Base case: factorial of 0 is 1 */
factorial(X, Y) :- 
    X > 0, /* Checks if X is greater than 0 */
    X1 is X - 1, /* Calculates X - 1 and stores it in X1 */
    factorial(X1, Y1), /* Finds the factorial of X1 and stores it in Y1 */
    Y is X * Y1. /* Calculates X * Y1 and stores the result in Y */
