% This is a knowledge base of facts about locations and their corresponding population
population(paris, 2_161_000). % 2,161,000 people live in Paris
population(london, 8_982_000). % 8,982,000 people live in London
population(tokyo, 13_515_000). % 13,515,000 people live in Tokyo
population(beijing, 21_516_000). % 21,516,000 people live in Beijing

% This is a rule that finds the city with the highest population
most_populous(City) :-
    population(City, Population), % gets the population of a city
    \+ (population(_, OtherPopulation), OtherPopulation > Population). % checks if there is no other city with higher population

% This is a rule that calculates the total population of a list of cities
total_population([], 0). % base case, empty list has population of 0
total_population([City|Cities], TotalPopulation) :-
    population(City, Population), % gets the population of a city
    total_population(Cities, OtherPopulation), % recursively calculates the total population of the remaining cities
    TotalPopulation is Population + OtherPopulation. % calculates the total population as the sum of the population of the current city and the total population of the remaining cities

% Example query:
% ?- most_populous(City), write(City). % finds the city with the highest population and prints it
% Output: beijing % because Beijing has the highest population of 21,516,000
