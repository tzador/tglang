% This code snippet finds the maximum element of a list

% Define the predicate for finding maximum element
find_max(List, Max) :-
    % Base case: if the list is empty, the maximum element is 0
    List = [] -> Max is 0;
    % Recursive case: if the list has only one element, that is the maximum
    List = [X] -> Max is X;
    % Recursive case: compare the first element with the maximum element of the rest of the list
    List = [H|T] -> find_max(T, SubMax), (H >= SubMax -> Max is H; Max is SubMax).

% Example query
?- find_max([1,3,5,2,7], Max).
% Output: Max = 7.
