% Define a predicate that returns the factorial of a given number
factorial(0, 1). % Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, Result) :- % Recursive case: factorial of N is N multiplied by the factorial of N-1
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    factorial(N1, Result1), % Recursively calculate the factorial of N-1
    Result is N * Result1. % Multiply N with the factorial of N-1 to get the final result
