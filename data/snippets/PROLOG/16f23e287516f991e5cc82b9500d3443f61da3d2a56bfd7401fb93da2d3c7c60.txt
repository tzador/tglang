/* This is a code snippet that checks if a given number is a prime number
  Input: An integer
  Output: A boolean value indicating whether the input is a prime number or not */

prime_number(X) :- /* Defines a rule for a prime number */
    X > 1, /* Checks if the input is greater than 1, since 1 is not considered a prime number */
    Y is X - 1, /* Assigns Y to be X minus 1 */
    prime_check(X, Y). /* Calls the prime_check predicate with X and Y as arguments */

/* Recursive predicate that checks if Y is a divisor of X */
prime_check(X, Y) :-
    Y > 1, /* Continues as long as Y is greater than 1 */
    X mod Y =\= 0, /* Checks if Y is not a divisor of X */
    Z is Y - 1, /* Assigns Z to be Y minus 1 */
    prime_check(X, Z). /* Recursively calls the prime_check predicate with X and Z as arguments */

/* Base case for the recursive prime_check predicate */
prime_check(_, 1) :- true. /* Returns true if Y reaches 1, indicating that X is a prime number */

/* Example usage: */
?- prime_number(7). /* Querying if 7 is a prime number */
true. /* Returns true since 7 is a prime number */
