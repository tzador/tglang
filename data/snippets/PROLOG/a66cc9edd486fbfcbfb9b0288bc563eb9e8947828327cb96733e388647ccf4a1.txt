% This is a predicate for finding the factorial of a number.
% The factorial of a number is the product of all numbers from 1 to that number
factorial(0,1). % base case, the factorial of 0 is 1

factorial(N, Factorial) :- % recursive case
    N > 0, % checks if N is greater than 0
    PrevN is N - 1, % subtracts 1 from N to get the previous number
    factorial(PrevN, PrevFactorial), % calls the factorial predicate with the previous number
    Factorial is N * PrevFactorial. % calculates the factorial using the previous factorial value

% Example query: factorial(5, Factorial).
% Output: Factorial = 120.
