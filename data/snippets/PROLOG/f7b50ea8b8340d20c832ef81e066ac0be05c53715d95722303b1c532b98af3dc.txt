%% This is a prolog program that implements the concept of recursion to find factorial of a given number

% Recursive case: when N is greater than 1
factorial(N, F) :- N > 1, N1 is N - 1,
                   factorial(N1, F1), F is N * F1.

% Base case: when N is 0 or 1
factorial(0, 1).
factorial(1, 1).
