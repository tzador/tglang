% Define a predicate "concat" with three parameters: X, Y and Z
concat(X, Y, Z) :-
% Z is the concatenation of X and Y
    append(X, Y, Z).

% Define a predicate "has_common_element" with two parameters: X and Y
has_common_element(X, Y) :-
% Check if the intersection of X and Y is not an empty list
    intersect(X, Y, []),
% If the intersection is empty, print "No common elements"
    write("No common elements").
% Otherwise, print "There are common elements"
    write("There are common elements").
