% This is a program that generates a list of prime numbers in a given range.

% First, we define a predicate that checks if a number is prime or not.
% A number is prime if it is only divisible by itself and 1.
prime(N) :- N > 1, N1 is N - 1, \+ (between(2, N1, X), N mod X =:= 0).

% Next, we define a predicate that generates a list of numbers within a given range.
range(Start, End, [Start|T]) :- Start =< End, NewStart is Start + 1, range(NewStart, End, T).
range(_, _, []).

% To generate a list of prime numbers within a given range, we use the built-in findall predicate.
% This predicate takes in a template and a goal, and returns a list of all the solutions that satisfy the goal.
primes_in_range(Start, End, Primes) :- findall(X, (range(Start, End, L), member(X, L), prime(X)), Primes).

% Example usage:
?- primes_in_range(1, 20, L).
% Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
