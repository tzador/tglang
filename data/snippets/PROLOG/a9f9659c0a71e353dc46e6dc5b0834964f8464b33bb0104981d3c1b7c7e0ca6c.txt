%% This prolog program defines a mathematical operation for finding the GCD of two numbers

% Defining the predicate for the GCD operation
gcd(X,Y,Result) :-
    % Set base case for when one of the numbers is 0
    Y =:= 0,
    Result is X.

gcd(X,Y,Result) :-
    % Set base case for when the numbers are equal
    X =:= Y,
    Result is X.

gcd(X,Y,Result) :-
    % Set case for when X is greater than Y
    X > Y,
    NewX is X - Y,
    % Recursively call gcd with new values
    gcd(NewX,Y,Result).

gcd(X,Y,Result) :-
    % Set case for when Y is greater than X
    X < Y,
    NewY is Y - X,
    % Recursively call gcd with new values
    gcd(X,NewY,Result).
