% This is a program written in PROLOG.
% It checks if a number is a prime number.

% The following code defines a predicate called 'is_prime', which takes in a single argument, 'N' and checks if it is a prime number.
is_prime(N) :- 
    % The predicate 'N' must be greater than 1, as 1 is not considered a prime number.
    N > 1,
    % The 'forall' predicate is used to iterate through all integers, 'I', between 2 and N-1.
    forall(between(2, N-1, I),
        % The 'mod' predicate is used to check if the remainder of N divided by I is 0.
        % If it is, then N is divisible by I and is not a prime number.
        mod(N, I) =\= 0).

% Now, we can use the is_prime predicate to check if a number is prime.
% For example, we want to check if 13 is a prime number.
?- is_prime(13).
% The expected output would be:
% true.
