% This is a program that generates a graph representation of a map

% Define the map using relationships between locations
location(a).
location(b).
location(c).
location(d).
location(e).

% Define the relationships between different locations
edge(a, b).
edge(a, c).
edge(b, d).
edge(c, d).
edge(c, e).
edge(d, e).
edge(e, a).

% Define a rule for finding a path between two locations
path(X, Y, [edge(X, Y)]) :- edge(X, Y).

% If there is a path between X and Z, and a path between Z and Y, then there is a path between X and Y
path(X, Y, [edge(X, Z) | Path]) :- path(Z, Y, Path), edge(X, Z).

% Output the list of paths between all pairs of locations
map :- location(X), location(Y), path(X, Y, Path), write(X), write(' to '), write(Y), write(': '), write(Path), nl, fail.

% Querying the map to find all paths between locations
?- map.
