% This is a Prolog program that defines a predicate for calculating the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number

% Define the base cases for the Fibonacci sequence
fib(0, 0).
fib(1, 1).

% Define the recursive rule for calculating the sequence
fib(N, F) :-
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    N2 is N - 2,
    fib(N1, F1),
    fib(N2, F2),
    F is F1 + F2.
    
% This predicate takes in a number N and outputs the Fibonacci sequence up to that number
fib_sequence(N, Seq) :-
    findall(F, fib(_, F), FibSeq),
    length(FibSeq, Len),
    Len =< N,
    append(FibSeq, [0], Seq),
    !.
   
% Example output: 
?- fib_sequence(7, Seq).
Seq = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13]
