% This is a Prolog program that solves the N-queens problem.
% In the N-queens problem, we have a chess board of size NxN and we need to
% place N queens on the board in such a way that no two queens can attack each other.

% The goal of this program is to find a possible solution for a given N.

% The following code defines a predicate called 'queen' that takes two parameters,
% X and Y, representing the position of a queen on the board.
% The predicate checks if the position is valid and does not conflict with any
% other queen already placed on the board.

queen(X, Y) :-
    % first, we define the limits for the board size
    % as X can range from 1 to N and Y can range from 1 to N.
    % this ensures that the queen is within the board boundaries.
    between(1, N, X),
    between(1, N, Y),
    % next, we check that no other queen is on the same column or row as this queen
    \+ (queen(X, Y1), Y \= Y1),
    \+ (queen(X1, Y), X \= X1),
    % then we check for diagonal attacks
    \+ (queen(X1, Y1), abs(X1-X) =:= abs(Y1-Y)).

% next, we define a predicate called 'n_queens' that takes two parameters,
% N and Result, where N is the size of the board and Result is the list of
% positions for the N queens.

n_queens(N, Result) :-
    % First, we create a list of numbers from 1 to N using 'findall'.
    % This will be used to represent the columns on the board.
    findall(I, between(1, N, I), Columns),
    % Then, we use the 'permutation' predicate to generate all possible permutations
    % of the list of columns.
    permutation(Columns, Permutation),
    % Finally, we filter through each permutation using the 'queen' predicate
    % to find a valid combination of queens.
    filter(queen, Permutation, Result).

% The 'filter' predicate takes three parameters:
% a predicate P, a list L, and a result R.
% It checks if the elements of L satisfy P and returns the list of elements that do.
filter(P, [H|T], [H|R]) :-
    call(P, H),
    filter(P, T, R).
filter(P, [_|T], R) :-
    filter(P, T, R).
filter(_, [], []).

% To get the solution, we can simply call the 'n_queens' predicate with the desired N.
% For example, n_queens(4, Result) will return Result = [2, 4, 1, 3].
