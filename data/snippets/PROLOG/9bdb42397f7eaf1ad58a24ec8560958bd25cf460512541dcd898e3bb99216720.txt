% This is a program that calculates the factorial of a number

% Define a predicate 'factorial' that takes in two arguments, N and Result
factorial(N, Result) :- 
    % N is 0, then Result is 1
    N = 0, 
    Result is 1.
    
% N is not 0
factorial(N, Result) :- 
    % N is greater than 1
    N > 1, 
    % Calculate the factorial of N-1 and store it in TempResult
    N1 is N-1, 
    factorial(N1, TempResult), 
    % Result is N multiplied by TempResult
    Result is N * TempResult.
