% Defining a predicate to find the sum of two numbers
sum(X, Y, Sum) :-
    % Checking if X is equal to 0
    X =:= 0,
    % Assigning Sum = Y when X = 0
    Sum is Y.
sum(X, Y, Sum) :-
    % Assigning X1 = X - 1
    X1 is X - 1,
    % Calling the sum predicate recursively
    sum(X1, Y, Sum1),
    % Adding X and Sum1 and storing it in Sum
    Sum is X + Sum1.
