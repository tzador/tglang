% Define a predicate for finding the longest
% common prefix of two lists
% Usage: common_prefix([List1], [List2], [Result])

common_prefix([], _, []).
% If first list is empty, the common prefix is also empty

common_prefix(_, [], []).
% If second list is empty, the common prefix is also empty

common_prefix([X|Xs], [X|Ys], [X|Prefix]) :- common_prefix(Xs, Ys, Prefix).
% If the head of both lists is the same, add it to the common prefix

common_prefix([X|Xs], [Y|Ys], []) :- X \= Y.
% If the head of both lists is different, there is no common prefix

% Example query:
% common_prefix([1,2,3,4,5,6], [1,2,3,5,6,7], Result).
% Result = [1,2,3]
