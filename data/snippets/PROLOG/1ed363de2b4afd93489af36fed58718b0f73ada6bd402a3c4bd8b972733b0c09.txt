%% This is a prolog program that calculates the factorial of a given number
%% Factorial is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number
%% For example, factorial of 4 is 4*3*2*1 = 24

%% Define a predicate factorial with two parameters, the number to calculate and the result
factorial(0, 1).      %% If the number is 0, then the result is 1
factorial(N, R) :-     %% Otherwise, recursively call the factorial predicate with N-1 and store the result as R1
    N > 0,
    N1 is N-1,
    factorial(N1, R1),
    R is N * R1.      %% The final result is N * R1, where R1 is the factorial of N-1
