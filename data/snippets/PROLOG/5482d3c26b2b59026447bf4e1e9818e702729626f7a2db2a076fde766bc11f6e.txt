% This is a Prolog code to find the factorial of a number
factorial(0, 1).  % Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, F) :-  
  N > 0,  % Check if N is greater than 0
  N1 is N - 1,  % Calculate N-1
  factorial(N1, F1),  % Recursive call to calculate factorial of N-1
  F is N * F1.  % Calculate factorial of N

?- factorial(5, F).  % Query to find factorial of 5
% Output: F = 120.  % The result of the query will be stored in F variable, which is 120 in this case
