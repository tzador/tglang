%% Define a predicate to check if a given list is a palindrome.

palindrome([]). %% An empty list is a palindrome.
palindrome([_]). %% A list with just one element is a palindrome.
palindrome([X|T]) :- reverse(T, L), member(X, L). %% A list is a palindrome if its first element is equal to the last element of its reversed list.

%% The built-in predicate reverse/2 reverses the elements in a list.
%% The built-in predicate member/2 checks if an element is a member of a list.
