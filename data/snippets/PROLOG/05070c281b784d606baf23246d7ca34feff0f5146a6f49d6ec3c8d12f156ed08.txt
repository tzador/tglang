% This is a Prolog program to find the maximum element in a list

% Defining a predicate 'max' which takes a list and a variable as arguments
max([Head|Tail], Max) :- 
  
  % Calling the predicate 'max' recursively on the tail of the list
  max(Tail, NewMax),
  
  % Comparing the head of the list with the current maximum element 
  % and storing the larger element in the variable 'Max'
  Head > NewMax,
  Max = Head.
  
% Base case when the list has only one element, 
% the maximum element is that element itself
max([Head], Head).

/*
Example query: 

?- max([1,2,9,4,5], Max).

Output:

Max = 9.
