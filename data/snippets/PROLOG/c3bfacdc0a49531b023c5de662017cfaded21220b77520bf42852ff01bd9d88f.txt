%% Defining a predicate to check if the given element is in the list. 
% The predicate takes in two parameters, the list and the element.
list_contains([Head|Tail], Element) :-
  % First, we check if the head of the list is equal to the element.
  Head = Element,
  !. % Cut operator to stop backtracking and prevent multiple solutions.
list_contains([Head|Tail], Element) :-
  % If the first check fails, we recursively call the predicate on the tail of the list.
  list_contains(Tail, Element).
  % This will continue until either the element is found or the list is empty.
  % If the element is not found, the predicate will fail.
