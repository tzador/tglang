% This is a code snippet in PROLOG
% It creates a database for students and their corresponding grades
% Each student has a name, ID, and a list of grades

% Create database for students
student("John Doe", 12345, [97, 85, 91]).
student("Jane Smith", 98765, [92, 94, 96]).
student("Bob Johnson", 24680, [80, 88, 75]).

% Define rule to calculate average grade for a student
average_grade(ID, Avg):- 
    student(_, ID, Grades), % "_ " is used as a "don't care" variable
    sum_list(Grades, Sum), 
    length(Grades, Count),
    Avg is Sum/Count.

% Define rule to retrieve all students with an average grade above 90
high_achievers(Student):- 
    student(Name, ID, Grades),
    average_grade(ID, Avg),
    Avg > 90,
    Student = [Name, Avg]. % Format output as list with student name and average grade

% Example query:
% high_achievers(Student).
% Output:
% Student = ["John Doe", 91] ;
% Student = ["Jane Smith", 94] ;
% No further solutions exist, so query terminates.
