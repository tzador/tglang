% Defining a predicate that checks if a list contains an even number

contains_even(List) :-
    % First, we define the base case for an empty list
    List = [],
    % The list cannot contain an even number if it is empty, so we fail
    fail.
contains_even(List) :-
    % Next, we define the recursive case for a non-empty list
    % We get the first element of the list using the built-in predicate 'nth0'
    % and store it in the variable 'X'
    nth0(0, List, X),
    % Now, we check if the first element is an even number using the built-in
    % predicate 'mod'
    % If the remainder after dividing X by 2 is 0, then X is an even number
    % and we succeed
    0 is mod(X, 2),
    !.
contains_even(List) :-
    % If the first element is not an even number, we remove it from the list
    % using the built-in predicate 'select'
    % The updated list is stored in the variable 'NewList'
    select(X, List, NewList),
    % We recursively call 'contains_even' on the updated list
    contains_even(NewList).
