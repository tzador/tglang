factorial(0,1).    %base case - 0 factorial is 1
factorial(N,Result):- %when N is greater than 0
N > 0,
N1 is N - 1,
factorial(N1, Result1),
Result is N * Result1.  %recursive case - factorial result is N multiplied by factorial of N-1
/* Some queries and their expected result */
?- factorial(5,X).
X = 120.

?- factorial(0,Y).
Y = 1.

?- factorial(8,Z).
Z = 40320.

?- factorial(3,6).
false.  %should return false, since factorial(3) is not equal to 6
