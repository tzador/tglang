% This code snippet creates a predicate for calculating the factorial of a given number
factorial(0, 1).      % The factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, F) :-    % For any number N, factorial of N is F if:
    N > 0,            % N is greater than 0 and
    N1 is N - 1,      % N1 is the number 1 less than N, and
    factorial(N1, F1),% The factorial of N1 is F1, and
    F is N * F1.      % The factorial of N is the number N multiplied by the factorial of N1
