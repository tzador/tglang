% A simple program to calculate the factorial of a given number

% factorial predicate with two arguments, the number to find factorial of and the result
factorial(0, 1). % base case, factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(X, Result) :- % recursive case, calls itself with decremented number and then multiplies with current number
    X > 0, % ensures number is positive
    PrevNum is X - 1, % calculates the decremented number
    factorial(PrevNum, PrevResult), % calls itself with the decremented number
    Result is X * PrevResult. % calculates the factorial of current number by multiplying with the factorial of decremented number

/*

Example query:
factorial(5, Result).
Result = 120.

Explanation:
The above query calls the factorial predicate with 5 as the number to find factorial of.
factorial(5, Result) :-
    5 > 0, % this condition is met
    PrevNum is 5 - 1, % decrements number to 4
    factorial(4, PrevResult), % calls itself with 4 and assigns the result to PrevResult
    Result is 5 * PrevResult. % calculates the factorial of 5 by multiplying with the factorial of 4, which is 24.
