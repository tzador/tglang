/*
This is a Prolog program that uses recursive rules to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
*/

% The GCD of a number and 0 is the number itself
gcd(X, 0, X).

% The GCD of two numbers is the same as the GCD of the smaller number and the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number
gcd(X, Y, GCD) :-
    X > Y,
    N is X - Y,
    gcd(Y, N, GCD).

gcd(X, Y, GCD) :-
    Y > X,
    N is Y - X,
    gcd(X, N, GCD).

% To run the program, pass in two numbers and the resulting GCD will be displayed
?- gcd(12, 18, GCD).
% Expected output: GCD = 6
