% This is a Prolog program that calculates the factorial of a given number.

% Helper predicate for calculating factorial
factorial(0,1).
factorial(N,F) :- N > 0, N1 is N - 1, factorial(N1,F1), F is N * F1.

% Main predicate that takes in a number and returns its factorial
calculate_factorial(N) :-
    factorial(N, F),
    write('The factorial of '), write(N), write(' is '), write(F), nl.

% Example goal: calculate_factorial(5).
% Output: The factorial of 5 is 120.

% Example goal: calculate_factorial(0).
% Output: The factorial of 0 is 1.

% Example goal: calculate_factorial(-5).
% Output: false.
