% This is an example of a Prolog program that uses recursion to find the nth element in a list.
% The program takes in two arguments: the list and the index of the element to be found.
% The output is the element at the specified index in the list.

% Define the base case: when the index is 0, return the first element of the list
nth_element(0, [X|_], X).

% Define the recursive case: reduce the index by 1 and call the function with the tail of the list
% until the base case is reached
nth_element(Index, [_|Tail], X) :-
   NewIndex is Index - 1,
   nth_element(NewIndex, Tail, X).

% Sample query: find the 3rd element in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
?- nth_element(2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], X).

% Output: X = 3
