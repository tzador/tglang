%% This is a Prolog program that defines a relationship between a list of numbers and their average
% First, we define a base case for an empty list
average([], 0).
% Next, we define a recursive rule that calculates the average of a list of numbers
average([Head|Tail], Avg) :-
    % Calculate the average of the remaining tail of the list
    average(Tail, AvgTail),
    % Add the head of the list to the average of the tail and divide by the number of elements in the list
    Avg is (Head + AvgTail) / (1 + TailLength),
    % Find the length of the tail of the list
    length(Tail, TailLength).
