% Given a list of numbers, this predicate will find the sum of all the numbers in the list

% The predicate add_numbers takes two arguments: a list of numbers and a variable to store the sum
add_numbers([], Sum). % Base case: if the list is empty, the sum is 0
add_numbers([H|T], Sum) :- % Recursive case: the sum is calculated by adding the head of the list to the sum of the remaining elements
    add_numbers(T, NewSum), % recursively call add_numbers to find the sum of the remaining elements
    Sum is H + NewSum. % add the head of the list to the calculated sum and store it in the Sum variable

% Example call: add_numbers([1,2,3,4,5], Total). will return Total = 15
