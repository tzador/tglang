% This is a prolog code snippet that implements a predicate `all_list_numbers` which takes in a list and checks if all elements in the list are numbers
all_list_numbers([]). % base case, an empty list is considered to have all numbers
all_list_numbers([H|T]) :- % this is the main predicate, it checks if the head of the list is a number and recursively calls the predicate on the tail
    number(H),
    all_list_numbers(T).
