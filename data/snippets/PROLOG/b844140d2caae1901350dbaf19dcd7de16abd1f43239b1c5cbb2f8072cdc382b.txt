% Defines a rule for calculating the factorial of a number
factorial(0, 1). % Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, R) :- % Recursive case: factorial of a number N is N times the factorial of N-1
    N > 0, % Ensures N is a positive number
    N1 is N - 1, % Calculates N-1
    factorial(N1, R1), % Calls the factorial rule with N-1 and stores the result in R1
    R is N * R1. % Calculates the factorial of N by multiplying it with the factorial of N-1

/*
Example usage:
factorial(5, Result).
Result = 120.
