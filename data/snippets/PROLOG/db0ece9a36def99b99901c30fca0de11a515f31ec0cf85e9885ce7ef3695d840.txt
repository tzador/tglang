% define a predicate that calculates the factorial of a given number
factorial(0,1).  % base case, factorial of 0 is 1
 
factorial(N,F) :-
  N > 0,           % check if N is greater than 0
  N1 is N - 1,     % subtract 1 from N
  factorial(N1,F1), % recursively call factorial on N1
  F is N * F1.     % multiply N by the factorial of N1 to get F
 
% example query: factorial(5,X).
% returns X = 120
