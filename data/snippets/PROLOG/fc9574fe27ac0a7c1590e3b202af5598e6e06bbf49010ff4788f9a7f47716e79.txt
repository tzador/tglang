% Define a predicate to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial(0, 1).                                    % Base case: Factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, F) :- N > 0, N1 is N-1, factorial(N1, F1), F is N * F1. 
                                                     % Recursive case: Factorial of N is N * factorial(N-1)
% Call the factorial predicate to calculate factorial of 5
?- factorial(5, F).                                  % ?- indicates a query
                                                     % F will be the output variable, which will store the result
                                                     % ?- factorial(5, F) will return F=120 as the output
