%This is a simple rule to find the maximum number in a list
%Usage: max_list([List], [Maximum Number])

max_list([Head|Tail],Max):-
  max_list(Tail,MaxTail), %this recursively calls the max_list rule until the list has only one element left
  (Head > MaxTail %if head is greater than the max of the tail,
  -> Max is Head %the max becomes the head
  ; Max is MaxTail). %else the max remains the max of the tail
 
max_list([Head], Max):- %base case: if the list has only one element
  Max is Head. %then the maximum number is simply that element
