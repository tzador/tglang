% This is a Prolog code snippet that implements a predicate for finding the factorial of a number

factorial(0,1). % This is the base case - factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N,F) :-
    N > 0, % Check that N is a positive integer
    N1 is N-1, % Decrement N by 1
    factorial(N1,F1), % Recursively find the factorial of N-1
    F is N * F1. % Multiply N with the factorial of N-1 to get the factorial of N

% Sample queries and their expected outputs:

%?- factorial(5, F).
% F = 120.
%
%?- factorial(0, F).
% F = 1.
%
%?- factorial(-3, F).
% false. % Returns false since -3 is not a positive integer
