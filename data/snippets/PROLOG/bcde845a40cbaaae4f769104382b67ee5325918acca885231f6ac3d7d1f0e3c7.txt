% Define fact and rule
%- A fact represents a basic statement or truth, which is always true.
fact(sunny). 
fact(warm).
fact(beach(sea)).
fact(beach(ocean)).

% A rule represents a logical condition that must be met in order for another fact or rule to be true.
% In this example, we define a rule that states if it is sunny and warm, then it is a good day for the beach.
rule(good_day_for_beach) :-
  fact(sunny),
  fact(warm).

% We can also define rules with multiple conditions using logical operators like AND and OR.
% In this example, we define a rule that states if it is sunny and (warm or hot), then it is a perfect day for the beach.
rule(perfect_day_for_beach) :-
  fact(sunny),
  (fact(warm) ; fact(hot)). 

% We can also use variables in rules to make them more flexible.
% In this example, we define a rule that states if it is sunny and the beach is near a sea or ocean, then it is a great day for the beach at that specific location.
rule(great_day_at_beach) :-
  fact(sunny),
  (fact(beach(sea)) ; fact(beach(ocean))).
