% This is a program that checks if a given input is a prime number or not.

% Define a predicate for checking if a number is a prime number.
is_prime(N) :-
N < 2, % If N is less than 2, it is not a prime number.
!. % Cut operator to stop further checks.
is_prime(N) :-
N =< 3, % If N is less than or equal to 3, it is a prime number.
!. % Cut operator to stop further checks.
is_prime(N) :-
integer(N), % Check if N is an integer.
N mod 2 =:= 0, % Check if N is divisible by 2.
!, % Cut operator to stop further checks.
fail. % If the above conditions are met, N is not a prime number.

% Check if N is divisible by any number from 3 to the square root of N.
is_prime(N) :-
integer(N), % Check if N is an integer.
N mod X =:= 0, % Check if N is divisible by X.
X < sqrt(N), % X should be less than the square root of N.
!. % Cut operator to stop further checks.

% If all the above conditions are not met, then N is a prime number.
