% This is a prolog program that calculates the length of a list
% Input: A list
% Output: The length of the list

% Clause 1: Base case: an empty list has length 0
length([], 0).

% Clause 2: Recursive case: increment the length by 1 for each recursive call
length([_|T], L) :- length(T, LT), L is LT + 1.
