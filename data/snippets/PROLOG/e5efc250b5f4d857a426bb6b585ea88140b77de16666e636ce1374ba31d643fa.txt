% Define a predicate that checks if a given number is prime
prime(2). % base case, 2 is a prime number
prime(N) :-  % recursive case
    N > 2, % ensure N is greater than 2
    N mod 2 =\= 0, % check if N is not divisible by 2, use `\=` for not equal in Prolog
    not(divisible(N, 3)). % call the divisible predicate to check if N is divisible by any number from 3 to N-1
 
% Define a predicate that checks if a given number is divisible by a certain number
divisible(N, X) :-
    N mod X =:= 0. % N is divisible by X if the remainder is 0
 
% Test cases for prime predicate
?- prime(5). % should return true
?- prime(6). % should return false
