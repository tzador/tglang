% This is a predicate that computes the factorial of a given number
factorial(0, 1). % Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, Result) :- 
    N > 0, % Check if N is greater than 0 (to avoid infinite loop)
    N1 is N - 1, % Define N1 as N-1
    factorial(N1, Result1), % Recursive call to compute factorial of N-1
    Result is N * Result1. % Compute factorial of N by multiplying it with factorial of N-1
