% Function to recursively calculate the factorial of a given number

factorial(0, 1).        % Base case: Factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, Result) :- % Recursive case: Factorial of N is N multiplied by the factorial of N - 1
    N > 0,
    Previous is N - 1,  % Calculate N - 1 and assign it to Previous
    factorial(Previous, PreviousResult), % Recursively call factorial with Previous and assign the result to PreviousResult
    Result is N * PreviousResult. % Calculate the factorial of N and assign it to Result by multiplying with PreviousResult
