% Rules for finding the parent of a person in a family tree
parent(john, jane).
parent(samantha, jane).
parent(eric, john).
parent(eric, sara).
parent(alice, samantha).
parent(alice, steve).

% Rule for finding the grandparent of a person
grandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y).
% This rule first looks for a parent of Y, which we can call Z, then looks for a parent of Z, which is the grandparent of Y. This relation can be loosely translated to "X is a grandparent of Y if X is a parent of a parent of Y."

% Query example
?- grandparent(alice, steve).
% Output: true. This is because alice is defined as the grandparent of steve in the parent fact rule.
