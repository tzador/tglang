%Factorial predicate with tail recursion
factorial(0,1).               % Base case, factorial of 0 is 1.
factorial(N,Fact) :-          % Recursive case.
    N > 0,                    % Ensure N is positive.
    N1 is N - 1,              % Decrease N by 1.
    factorial(N1,Fact1),      % Recursively call factorial with N - 1.
    Fact is N * Fact1.        % Multiply N with result of N - 1 factorial.

/* 
 * Input: factorial(5,X).
 * Output: X = 120.
