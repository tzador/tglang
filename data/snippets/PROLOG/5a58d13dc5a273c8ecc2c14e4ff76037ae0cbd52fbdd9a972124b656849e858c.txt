%% Defining a rule to check if a number is divisible by another number
divisible(X,Y) :-							%% defining a rule "divisible" with two parameters X and Y
    0 is X mod Y. 							%% checking if X is divisible by Y using the mod operator and comparing it to 0
											%% if it is, then the rule evaluates to true
%% Defining a rule to check if a number is a prime number
is_prime(X) :- 								%% defining a rule "is_prime" with one parameter X
    X > 1,  								%% ensuring that the number is greater than 1 (since 1 is neither prime nor composite)
    Y is X - 1,								%% creating a variable Y that is one less than X
    \+ (divisible(X,Y)).					%% checking if X is not divisible by any number (from 2 to Y-1) using the "divisible" rule
											%% if it is not divisible, then the rule evaluates to true
%% Defining a predicate to generate a list of prime numbers within a given range
 prime_list(X, X, []).						%% base case: when the starting and ending number are equal, the list is empty
prime_list(Start, End, [Start|L]) :-		%% recursive rule: when the starting and ending number are not equal
    Start < End,							%% ensuring that the starting number is less than the ending number
    is_prime(Start),						%% checking if the starting number is a prime using the "is_prime" rule
    Next is Start + 1,						%% creating a variable Next that is one more than the starting number
    prime_list(Next, End, L).				%% recursively calling the "prime_list" predicate with the updated starting number and the list
prime_list(Start, End, L) :-				%% recursive rule: when the starting and ending number are not equal
    Start < End,							%% ensuring that the starting number is less than the ending number
    \+ is_prime(Start),						%% checking if the starting number is not a prime using the "is_prime" rule
    Next is Start + 1,						%% creating a variable Next that is one more than the starting number
    prime_list(Next, End, L).				%% recursively calling the "prime_list" predicate with the updated starting number and the list
