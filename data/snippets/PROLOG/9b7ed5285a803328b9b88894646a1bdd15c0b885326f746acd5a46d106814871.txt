% This is a simple prolog program to find the sum of two numbers

% The predicate sum(X,Y,Z) takes in two numbers, X and Y, and returns their sum Z
sum(X,Y,Z):-
  Z is X + Y. % Z is the sum of X and Y
  
% The predicate start prompts the user for two numbers and calls the sum predicate
start:-
  write('Enter first number: '), % prompts the user to enter the first number
  read(A), % reads the input and assigns it to the variable A
  write('Enter second number: '), % prompts the user to enter the second number
  read(B), % reads the input and assigns it to the variable B
  sum(A,B,Result), % calls the sum predicate with the values of A and B, and assigns the result to the variable Result
  write('The sum is: '), % prompts the user to print the sum
  write(Result). % prints the value of Result
