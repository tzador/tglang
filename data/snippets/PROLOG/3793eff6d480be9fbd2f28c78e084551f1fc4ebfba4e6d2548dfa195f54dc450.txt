% Rule to determine if X is the greatest common divisor of A and B
gcd(A, B, X) :-
    % Check if A and B are equal
    A = B,
    X is A.
gcd(A, B, X) :-
    % Check if A is greater than B
    A > B,
    % Subtract B from A and run gcd recursively
    Y is A - B,
    gcd(B, Y, X).
gcd(A, B, X) :-
    % Check if B is greater than A
    B > A,
    % Subtract A from B and run gcd recursively
    Y is B - A,
    gcd(A, Y, X).
