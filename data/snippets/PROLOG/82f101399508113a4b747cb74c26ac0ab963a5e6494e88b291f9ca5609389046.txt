% This is a Prolog program to find the factorial of a number.

% The base case for factorial is when the number is 0, which will always result in 1.
factorial(0, 1).
% The recursive case for factorial is when the number is greater than 0.
factorial(N, Result) :-
    N > 0,
    % Get the factorial of N-1.
    N1 is N-1,
    % Recursive call to factorial with N-1.
    factorial(N1, Result1),
    % Multiply N and Result1 to get the final factorial result.
    Result is N * Result1.
