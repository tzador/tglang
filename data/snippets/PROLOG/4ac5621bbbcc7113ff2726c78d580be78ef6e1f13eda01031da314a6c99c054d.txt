/** This is a Prolog predicate that calculates the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence. **/

fibonacci(0, 0). // Base case, 0th element is 0.
fibonacci(1, 1). // Base case, 1st element is 1.

fibonacci(N, R) :- // Recursive case, where N is the nth element and R is the result.
    N > 1, // Make sure N is greater than 1.
    N1 is N - 1, // Subtract 1 from N to get the previous element.
    N2 is N - 2, // Subtract 2 from N to get the element before the previous element.
    fibonacci(N1, R1), // Recursive call to get the previous element.
    fibonacci(N2, R2), // Recursive call to get the element before the previous element.
    R is R1 + R2. // Add the previous two elements to get the result.
