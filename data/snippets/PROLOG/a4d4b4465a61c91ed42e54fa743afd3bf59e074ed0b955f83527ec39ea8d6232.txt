% This is a Prolog program that calculates the factorial of a number

factorial(0, 1). % base case for factorial of 0

factorial(N, Result) :- % recursive case for factorial
    integer(N), % check if input is an integer
    N > 0, % ensure input is a positive number
    N1 is N - 1, % subtract 1 from input
    factorial(N1, Result1), % recursively call factorial on N-1
    Result is N * Result1. % multiply N with the result of factorial(N-1)

/**
Example query:
?- factorial(5, Result)
Result = 120

Explanation:
The program defines factorial(0, 1) as the base case, stating that the factorial of 0 is 1.
Then, the recursive case is defined as factorial(N, Result) where N is an integer greater than 0.
Inside the recursive case, the program first checks if N is a positive integer and then subtracts 1 from N.
Next, it recursively calls factorial on N-1, storing the result in Result1.
Finally, the program multiplies N with Result1 to get the factorial of N, which is then stored in Result.
This snippet also includes an example query and its expected result, showing the functionality of the program.
