%% A recursive predicate to find the factorial of a number
factorial(0, 1). % Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, Result) :- % Recursive case: factorial of N is N * factorial of N-1
    N > 0, % Ensure N is a positive integer
    N1 is N - 1, % Decrement N by 1
    factorial(N1, TempResult), % Get the factorial of N-1
    Result is N * TempResult. % Multiply N with the factorial of N-1 to get the final result
