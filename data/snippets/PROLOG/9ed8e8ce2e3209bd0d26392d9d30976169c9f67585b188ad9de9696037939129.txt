% A simple rule to deduce if two colors are complementary
complementary_color(Color1, Color2) :-
    % Check for complementary primary colors (red, green, and blue)
    primary(Color1), primary(Color2), not(Color1 = Color2),
    (Color1 = red, Color2 = green) ;
    (Color1 = red, Color2 = blue) ;
    (Color1 = green, Color2 = red) ;
    (Color1 = green, Color2 = blue) ;
    (Color1 = blue, Color2 = red) ;
    (Color1 = blue, Color2 = green).

% A helper predicate to check if a color is a primary color
primary(Color) :-
    (Color = red) ;
    (Color = green) ;
    (Color = blue).

% Example query
?- complementary_color(red, green). % Will return 'true' as red and green are complementary primary colors
