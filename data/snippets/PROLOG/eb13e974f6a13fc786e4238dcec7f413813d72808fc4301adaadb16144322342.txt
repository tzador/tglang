% define a predicate that calculates the factorial of a number
factorial(0, 1). % base case, factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, Result) :-
    N > 0, % check if N is positive
    N1 is N - 1, % subtract 1 from N
    factorial(N1, Result1), % recursively call factorial with N1
    Result is N * Result1. % multiply N with the factorial of N1 to get Result
