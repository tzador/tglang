% This is a Prolog implementation of the breadth-first search algorithm.
% It takes a starting node and a goal node, and returns the shortest path between them.

% Create a predicate to represent the edge relation between two nodes.
edge(start, node1).
edge(node1, node2).
edge(node2, node3).
edge(node3, node4).
edge(node4, goal).

% Define a predicate to represent the breadth-first search algorithm.
bfs(Start, Goal, Path) :- 
    bfs(Q, [], Start, Goal, Path).

% Define the main bfs predicate.
bfs([Node|_], _, Node, Goal, [Node]) :- 
    % Check if the goal node has been reached.
    node == Goal.

bfs(Queue, Visited, Node, Goal, Path) :-
    % Check if node has been visited before.
    \+ member(Node, Visited),

    % Get the edges of the current node.
    bagof(NextNode, edge(Node, NextNode), Children),

    % Add the children to the back of the queue.
    append(Queue, Children, NewQueue),

    % Add the current node to the list of visited nodes.
    append(Visited, [Node], NewVisited),

    % Recursively call bfs using the updated queue and visited nodes.
    bfs(NewQueue, NewVisited, NextNode, Goal, Path).

% Print the shortest path between two nodes.
