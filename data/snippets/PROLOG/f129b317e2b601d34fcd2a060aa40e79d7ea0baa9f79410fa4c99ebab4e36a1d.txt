%% Define a rule for finding the factorial of a number
factorial(0,1). % If the number is 0, the factorial is 1
factorial(N,Result) :- % For any other number, use recursion to calculate factorial
    N > 0, % Make sure N is a positive integer
    N1 is N - 1, % Decrease N by 1
    factorial(N1,SubResult), % Calculate factorial of N-1
    Result is N * SubResult. % Multiply N with factorial of N-1 to get factorial of N

?- factorial(5,X). % Query: Find the factorial of 5
X = 120. % Output: Factorial is 120
