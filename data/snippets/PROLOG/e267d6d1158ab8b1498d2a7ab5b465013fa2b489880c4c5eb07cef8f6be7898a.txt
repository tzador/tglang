% This is a Prolog program that calculates the factorial of a given number

% Define the base case in the recursive factorial rule
factorial(0,1).

% Define the recursive factorial rule
factorial(N,Result) :-
    N > 0, % Check if N is greater than 0 to prevent infinite recursion
    N1 is N - 1, % Decrement N by 1 for the next recursive call
    factorial(N1,Result1), % Call the factorial predicate with N1
    Result is N * Result1. % Multiply N by the result of the previous call

% Query the factorial predicate to find the factorial of 5
?- factorial(5,X).
% Output: X = 120
