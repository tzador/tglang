% This is a Prolog program that defines a predicate that checks if a list is a palindrome
% The predicate has two parameters, the first being the list to be checked and the second being the reversed list
% If the reversed list is equal to the original list, then the program outputs true, otherwise false

palindrome(List, Reversed) :- % Defining predicate 'palindrome' with two parameters
  reverse(List, Reversed), % Reversing the original list and storing it in the variable 'Reversed'
  List = Reversed. % Checking if original list is equal to reversed list and returning true or false accordingly

:- initialization(main). % Calling main function when program is run

main :- % Defining main function
  write('Enter a list: '), read(List), % Prompting user to input a list and storing it in variable 'List'
  palindrome(List, Reversed), % Calling 'palindrome' predicate with 'List' as the first parameter and storing it the 'Reversed' variable
  write('Palindrome: '), write(Reversed). % Printing the result (reversed list) to the console
