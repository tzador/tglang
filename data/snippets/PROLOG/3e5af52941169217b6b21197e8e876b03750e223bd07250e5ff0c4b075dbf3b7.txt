%% Define the max predicate
max(X, Y, Result) :-
    X > Y, % If X is greater than Y,
    Result is X. % Then Result is X
max(X, Y, Result) :-
    Y > X, % If Y is greater than X,
    Result is Y. % Then Result is Y
max(X, X, Result) :-
    Result is X. % If both X and Y are equal,
%%% We assume that a number is its own maximum
%%% Therefore, we just assign Result as X
