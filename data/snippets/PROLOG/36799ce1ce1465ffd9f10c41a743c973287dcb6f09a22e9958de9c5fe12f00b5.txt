% This is a program that computes the factorial of a given number using recursion
% The base case is when the number is 0, the factorial is 1
factorial(0,1).
% Recursive case, compute factorial for n-1 and multiply by n
factorial(N, Result) :-
    N > 0, % Make sure the number is positive
    N1 is N - 1, % Calculate N-1
    factorial(N1, Result1), % Recursively call factorial for N-1
    Result is N * Result1. % Multiply N and factorial of N-1 to get the factorial of N
% Example query: factorial(5, Result).
% Expected output: Result = 120
