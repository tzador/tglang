%%% This is a Prolog program that generates a list of all possible paths in a graph %%%

%%% define the predicates %%%

% edge(Parent, Child) defines the edges between nodes in the graph
% path(Node1, Node2, Path) will be true if there exists a path from Node1 to Node2
% visited(Node) marks a node as visited to avoid infinite loops

%%% define the rules %%%

% Base case: if there exists a path between two nodes, return the path
path(Node, Node, [Node]).

% Recursive case: if there exists an edge between the current node and a child node
% and that child node has not been visited yet
% then add the current node to the beginning of the path and recursively call the
% predicate with the child node as the new current node
% and add the result to the final path
path(Node1, Node2, [Node1|Path]) :-
    edge(Node1, Child),
    \+ visited(Child),
    path(Child, Node2, Path).

%%% generate the paths %%%

% start the search from a given starting node, and keep track of visited nodes
generate_paths(Start) :-
    \+ visited(Start),
    assert(visited(Start)),
    % use a built-in predicate to find all possible paths starting from the given node
    findall(Path, path(Start, _, Path), Paths),
    % print out the paths
    write(Paths).

%%% example graph %%%

% define the edges of the graph
edge(a, b).
edge(a, c).
edge(b, d).
edge(c, d).
edge(c, e).
edge(d, e).

%%% run the program %%%

% generate all paths starting from node a
?- generate_paths(a).

% output:
% [[[a, b, d, e], [a, c, d, e]], [[a, c, e], [a, b, d, e]]]
