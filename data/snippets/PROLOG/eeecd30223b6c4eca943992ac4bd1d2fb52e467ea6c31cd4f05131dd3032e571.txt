% This is a PROLOG program that uses logic programming to solve a puzzle.

% Define a predicate to check if a list contains unique elements.
unique([]). % If the list is empty, it is considered unique.
unique([H|T]) :- not(member(H, T)), unique(T). % Check if the first element is not in the rest of the list, and recursively check the rest.

% Define a predicate to check if a list contains all elements from another list.
contains_all([], _). % If the list to check for is empty, then all elements are present.
contains_all([H|T], L) :- member(H, L), contains_all(T, L). % Check if the first element is in the list to check for, and recursively check the rest.

% Define a predicate to check if a list contains consecutive numbers.
consecutive([_]). % If there is only one element, it cannot be consecutive.
consecutive([H1,H2|T]) :- H2 is H1 + 1, consecutive([H2|T]). % Check if the second element is one more than the first, and recursively check the rest.

% Define a predicate to check if a list contains non-consecutive numbers.
non_consecutive(L) :- not(consecutive(L)). % If the list is not consecutive, then it is non-consecutive.

% Define a predicate to check if a list is valid for the puzzle.
valid_list(L) :-
    length(L, 6), % The list must have 6 elements.
    unique(L), % The list must contain unique elements.
    contains_all([1,2,3,4,5,6], L), % The list must contain all numbers from 1 to 6.
    non_consecutive(L). % The list must not contain consecutive numbers.

% Define a predicate to solve the puzzle.
puzzle(L) :-
    valid_list(L), % The list must be valid.
    L = [A,B,C,D,E,F], % Assign variables to the list elements for easier referencing.
    (A = 3 ; B = 3), % Condition 1: A or B is 3.
    (C = 4 ; D = 4), % Condition 2: C or D is 4.
    (E = 2 ; F = 2), % Condition 3: E or F is 2.
    A = 5, % Condition 4: A is 5.
    sumlist(L, 18). % Sum of all elements must be 18.
