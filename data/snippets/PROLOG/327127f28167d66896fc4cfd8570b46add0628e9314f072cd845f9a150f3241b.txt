% Factorial program in Prolog
% Calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion
% Created by [Your Name]

factorial(0,1). % Base case: factorial of 0 is 1

% Recursive case
factorial(N, F) :-
    N > 0, 
    N1 is N - 1, % Decrease N by 1
    factorial(N1, F1), % Calculate factorial of N-1
    F is N * F1. % Multiply N with factorial of N-1 to get factorial of N

% Sample query: factorial(5, F)
% Expected output: F = 120
