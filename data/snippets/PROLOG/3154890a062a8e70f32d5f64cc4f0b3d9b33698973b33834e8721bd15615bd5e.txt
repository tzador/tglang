% Define a predicate to check if a list is a sub-list of another list
sublist(_, []) :-
    % If the second list is empty, then it is a sub-list of any list
    !.
sublist([H|T], [H|S]) :-
    % If the first element of both lists match, try to match the rest
    sublist(T, S).
sublist(X, [_|T]) :-
    % If the first element of the second list does not match, try the rest
    sublist(X, T).
