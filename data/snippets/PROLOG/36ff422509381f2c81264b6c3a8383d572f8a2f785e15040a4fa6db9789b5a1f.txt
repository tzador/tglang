% Define a predicate that checks if any two lists have a common element.
% The first argument is the first list, the second argument is the second list.
% The third argument is the common element.

common_element(List1, List2, Common) :-
    % First, we use a built-in predicate member to check each element in List1.
    member(X, List1),
    % Then, we use another built-in predicate member to check each element in List2.
    member(X, List2),
    % Finally, we unify the Common element with X.
    Common = X.
