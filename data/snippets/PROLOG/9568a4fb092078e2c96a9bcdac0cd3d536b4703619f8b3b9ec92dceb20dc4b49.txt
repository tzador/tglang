% This is a program that checks if a given word is a palindrome 

% Rules for case where word has even number of letters
palindrome(Str) :-
    atom_chars(Str, Chars), % turn string into list of characters
    reverse(Chars, CharsRev), % reverse the list of characters
    Chars = CharsRev. % unify the two lists to see if they are the same

% Rules for case where word has odd number of letters
palindromeOdd(Str, Mid) :-
    atom_chars(Str, Chars), % turn string into list of characters
    delete(Chars, Mid, CharsNew), % delete the middle character
    reverse(CharsNew, CharsRev), % reverse the list of characters
    CharsNew = CharsRev. % unify the two lists to see if they are the same

% Rules for case where word has even number of letters
palindromeEven(Str, Left, Right) :-
    atom_chars(Str, Chars), % turn string into list of characters
    delete(Chars, Left, Chars1), % delete the left half
    delete(Chars1, Right, CharsNew), % delete the right half
    reverse(CharsNew, CharsRev), % reverse the list of characters
    CharsNew = CharsRev. % unify the two lists to see if they are the same
