%% This is a Prolog program that implements a simple calculator.
%% It takes in two numbers and performs four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on them.

%% The main predicate takes in two numbers and calls the four operation predicates, using pattern matching.
calculate(Number1, Number2) :-
    addition(Number1, Number2),
    subtraction(Number1, Number2),
    multiplication(Number1, Number2),
    division(Number1, Number2).

%% The addition predicate takes in two numbers, adds them together, and outputs the result.
addition(Number1, Number2) :-
    Result is Number1 + Number2,
    format("Addition result: ~w", [Result]), nl. %% prints the result with a new line

%% The subtraction predicate takes in two numbers, subtracts the second number from the first, and outputs the result.
subtraction(Number1, Number2) :-
    Result is Number1 - Number2,
    format("Subtraction result: ~w", [Result]), nl.

%% The multiplication predicate takes in two numbers, multiplies them together, and outputs the result.
multiplication(Number1, Number2) :-
    Result is Number1 * Number2,
    format("Multiplication result: ~w", [Result]), nl.

%% The division predicate takes in two numbers, divides the first number by the second, and outputs the result.
division(Number1, Number2) :-
    Number2 =\= 0, % checks for division by zero
    Result is Number1 / Number2,
    format("Division result: ~w", [Result]), nl.
division(_, Number2) :- %_ is the anonymous variable, used as a wildcard
    Number2 =:= 0,
    nl, format("Cannot divide by zero!").

%% Sample query:
calculate(5, 2).
%% Output:
%% Addition result: 7
%% Subtraction result: 3
%% Multiplication result: 10
%% Division result: 2.5
