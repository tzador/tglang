% This is a Prolog program that demonstrates the use of recursion.
% The goal of this program is to find the sum of all elements in a given list.

% Define the base case, where the sum of an empty list is 0.
sum([], 0).

% Define the recursive case, where the sum of a list is the first element plus the sum of the rest of the list.
sum([Head|Tail], Total) :-
    sum(Tail, Sum),
    Total is Head + Sum.

% Test the predicate with a sample list.
?- sum([1,2,3,4,5], Total).
% Expected output: Total = 15.
