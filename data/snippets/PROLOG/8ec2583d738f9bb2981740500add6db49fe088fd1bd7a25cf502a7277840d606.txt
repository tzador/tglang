%% Define a predicate for calculating the nth Fibonacci number.

fib(0, 0). % Base case, the nth Fibonacci number is 0 if n is 0

fib(1, 1). % Base case, the nth Fibonacci number is 1 if n is 1

fib(N, F) :- % Recursive definition, where N is the nth number and F is the Fibonacci number
    N > 1, % Condition: N must be greater than 1
    N1 is N - 1, % Decrease N by 1 
    fib(N1, F1), % Recursive call to get the (n-1)th Fibonacci number
    N2 is N - 2, % Decrease N by 2 
    fib(N2, F2), % Recursive call to get the (n-2)th Fibonacci number
    F is F1 + F2. % Add (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers to get the nth one
