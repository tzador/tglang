factorial(0,1). % Base case for recursive function
factorial(N,Val):- % Recursive definition for factorial
N>0,N1 is N-1, % Checks if N is greater than 0 and assigns N-1 to N1
factorial(N1,Val1), % Recursively calculates factorial of N-1 and assigns it to Val1
Val is Val1*N. % Calculates factorial of N and assigns it to Val
