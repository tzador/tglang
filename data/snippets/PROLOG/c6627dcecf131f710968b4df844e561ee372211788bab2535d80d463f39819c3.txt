/** This is a Prolog code snippet that defines a predicate "puzzle" which takes in two lists as input and outputs a list of all possible combinations of elements from both lists
A list representing a puzzle may consist of:
- Numbers from 1 to 9
- Empty slots represented by "0"
Example:
?- puzzle([1,0,3],[2,5,0], P).
P = [1,2,3];P = [1,5,3];P = [2,0,3];P = [2,2,3];P = [2,5,3];P = [2,7,3]
**/
puzzle(List1, List2, P) :-  % Define predicate "puzzle" with three arguments (two lists and output list)
    length(List1, N1), % Get the length of List1
    length(List2, N2), % Get the length of List2
    N1 = N2, % Make sure both lists have same length
    permutation(List2, List2_perm), % Generate all permutations of List2
    puzzle_helper(List1, List2_perm, [], P). % Call helper predicate with empty list as accumulator

puzzle_helper([], [], Acc, Acc). % Base case: When both lists are empty, return accumulator as output

puzzle_helper([Head1|Tail1], [Head2|Tail2], Acc, P) :-
    Head1 = 0, % If first element of List1 is 0, add Head2 to accumulator and continue
    puzzle_helper(Tail1, Tail2, [Head2|Acc], P).

puzzle_helper([Head1|Tail1], [Head2|Tail2], Acc, P) :-
    Head1 \= 0, % If first element of List1 is not 0, add it to accumulator and continue
    puzzle_helper(Tail1, [Head2|Tail2], [Head1|Acc], P).

permutation([], []). % Base case: When list is empty, return empty list

permutation(List, [Head|Permutation]) :-
    select(Head, List, Rest), % Select an element from list to be the head of permutation list
    permutation(Rest, Permutation). % Recursively call permutation predicate with rest of the elements in list

/** Example output:
?- puzzle([1,0,3],[2,5,0], P).
P = [1,2,3];
P = [1,5,3];
P = [2,0,3];
P = [2,2,3];
P = [2,5,3];
P = [2,7,3]
