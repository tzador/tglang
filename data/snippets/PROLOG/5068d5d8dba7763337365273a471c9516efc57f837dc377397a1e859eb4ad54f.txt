%% A rule that checks if a given number is a factorial of another number
factorial(N, 1) :-       % Base case: 1 is the factorial of any number
    N =:= 1.
factorial(N, Result) :-  % Recursive case: Result is N multiplied by the factorial
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    factorial(N1, R1),
    Result is N * R1.
