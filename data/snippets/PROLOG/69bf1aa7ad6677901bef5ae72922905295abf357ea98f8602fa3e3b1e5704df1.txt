% This is a snippet of PROLOG code that checks if a list is a palindrome
palindrome(X) :- reverse(X, X). % Predicate that checks if the reverse of X is equal to X
reverse([],[]). % Base case - empty list is its own reverse
reverse([H|T], R) :- reverse(T,RevT), % Recursive call to reverse the tail of the list
    append(RevT, [H], R). % Append the head of the list to the reversed tail to get the full reverse
% The append predicate combines two lists by putting them together
% Usage: palindrome([a,b,c,c,b,a]). returns true
% palindrome([a,b,c,d]). returns false
