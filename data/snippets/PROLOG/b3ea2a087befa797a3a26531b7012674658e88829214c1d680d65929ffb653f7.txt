/* Predicate to check if two lists are equal */
equal([],[]). /* Base case: Two empty lists are equal */
equal([H1|T1],[H2|T2]):- /* Recursive case: Check if the first elements are equal, then check the remaining elements */
    H1=H2, /* Check first elements are equal */
    equal(T1,T2). /* Check remaining elements are equal */

/* Predicate to find the lesser of two numbers */
lesser_or_equal(X,Y,X):- /* If X is Lesser than Y, then X is the lesser of the two */
    X=<Y. /* Check if X is less than or equal to Y */
lesser_or_equal(X,Y,Y):- /* If Y is Lesser than X, then Y is the lesser of the two */
    Y=<X. /* Check if Y is less than or equal to X */

/* Predicate to find the factorial of a number */
factorial(0,1). /* Base case: Factorial of 0 is 1 */
factorial(N,F):- /* Recursive case: Multiply N with the factorial of N-1 */
    N>0, /* Check if N is greater than 0 */
    N1 is N-1, /* Calculate N-1 */
    factorial(N1,F1), /* Recursively calculate factorial of N-1 */
    F is N*F1. /* Factorial of N is N multiplied with factorial of N-1 */
