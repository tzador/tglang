%% Program to find the factorial of a number

factorial(0, 1).       % base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, Result) :- % recursive case: factorial of N is N * factorial(N-1)
    N > 0,             % check if N is a positive integer
    N1 is N - 1,       % calculate N-1
    factorial(N1, R1), % recursively calculate factorial of N-1
    Result is N * R1.  % calculate factorial of N by multiplying N with factorial of N-1
