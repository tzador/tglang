% Example of a predicate that finds the maximum element in a list
max_list([Head|Tail], Max) :- % Define the predicate with two arguments, the first being the list and the second being the maximum element in the list
	Max1 is Head, % Set the first element of the list as the current maximum
	max_list(Tail, Max2), % Call the max_list predicate recursively with the tail of the list, which gives the maximum element in the tail
	Max1 > Max2, % Compare the current maximum with the maximum of the tail
	Max is Max1. % If the current maximum is greater, set it as the maximum
max_list([Head|Tail], Max) :- % If the current maximum is not greater, continue with the rest of the list
	Max1 is Max, % Set the current maximum as the new maximum
	max_list(Tail, Max1). % Call the max_list predicate recursively with the remaining list
% Example query: max_list([3,5,2,8,1], Max).
% Output: Max = 8.
