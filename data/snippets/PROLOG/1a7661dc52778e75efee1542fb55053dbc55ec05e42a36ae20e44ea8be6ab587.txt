%% A predicate that recursively checks if a list is a palindrome
palindrome(List) :- reverse(List, List).  % base case, empty list or single element list is a palindrome
palindrome([_]).  % base case, single element list is a palindrome
palindrome([]).  % base case, empty list is a palindrome
palindrome([X|Xs]) :- palindrome(Xs), last(Xs, X).  % recursively check if the tail is a palindrome and last element of tail is the same as first element of original list
