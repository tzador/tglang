% This is a Prolog predicate to find the maximum element in a list
maximum([X], X). % If there is only one element in the list, it is the maximum
maximum([X|L], X) :- maximum(L, Y), X >= Y. % Recursive rule, X is maximum if it is >= the maximum of remaining list L
maximum([X|L], M) :- maximum(L, M), X < M. % Recursive rule, M is maximum if it is > the maximum of remaining list L
