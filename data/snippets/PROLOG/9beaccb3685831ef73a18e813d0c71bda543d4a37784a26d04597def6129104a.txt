% This is a program that performs a reverse depth-first search on a graph
% and returns the path from a given start node to a goal node.

% First, we define a predicate to check if a node is in a given graph
in_graph(Node, [Node|_]).
in_graph(Node, [_|Rest]) :- in_graph(Node, Rest).

% Next, we define the reverse depth-first search algorithm
% The arguments of the predicate are:
% - Start node: The node to start the search from
% - Goal node: The node we are trying to reach
% - Visited nodes: A list of already visited nodes, to avoid loops
% - Path: The current path being explored
% - Result: The final path from start node to goal node

% Base case: If we reach the goal node, add it to the path and return
reverse_dfs(Goal, Goal, _, Path, Result) :-
    append(Path, [Goal], Result).

% Recursive case: We explore the neighbors of the current node
reverse_dfs(Node, Goal, Visited, Path, Result) :-
    in_graph(Node, Visited),                    % Check if already visited to avoid loops
    reverse_dfs(Goal, Node, Visited, Path, Result).     % Explore neighbors

% To perform the search, we call the reverse_dfs predicate with the start node
% and an empty list of already visited nodes
% The result path is stored in the variable 'Result'
% Replace the values of StartNode and GoalNode with the actual nodes in your graph
?- reverse_dfs(StartNode, GoalNode, [], [StartNode], Result).
