% A rule in Prolog to find the factorial of a number

factorial(X, Result) :- % defines a rule named "factorial" that takes in two parameters, "X" and "Result"
	X = 0, % checks if the value of X is 0
	Result = 1. % if so, sets the value of Result to 1 (base case)
factorial(X, Result) :- % defines another rule for "factorial" that takes in the same parameters
	X > 0, % checks if the value of X is greater than 0
	X1 is X - 1, % uses the "is" operator to assign the result of X-1 to X1
	factorial(X1, Result1), % recursively calls the factorial rule with X1 as the first parameter, assigning the result to Result1
	Result is X * Result1. % multiplies X and Result1, assigning the result to Result (recursive case)
