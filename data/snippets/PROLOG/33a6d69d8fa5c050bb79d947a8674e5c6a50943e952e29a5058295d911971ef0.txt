% This is a Prolog code snippet that finds the length of a given list.
% The `length` predicate takes in two arguments, the list and a variable `N` to store the length.
% The `_` in the head of the rule is a placeholder for any value to be ignored.
% The `N` variable is incremented by 1 for each iteration until the list is empty.
% The base case is when the list is empty, `N` is 0.
% The `<` operator is used to compare the length of the list to 0 to ensure it is not an empty list.
% The `length` predicate is then recursively called on the tail of the list to continue incrementing `N`.
length([], 0).                                      % base case
length([_|T], N) :- N > 0, length(T, N1), N is N1 + 1. % recursive rule, increment `N` by 1
