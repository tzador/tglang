% This is a sample knowledge base in PROLOG

% Defining the relationships between animals
% `ancestor` is a recursive predicate to check if a given animal is the ancestor of another animal
ancestor(X,Y):- parent(X,Y).
ancestor(X,Y):- parent(X,Z), ancestor(Z,Y).

% Defining the properties of different animals
% `mammal` and `bird` are two categories of animals
mammal(chimpanzee).
mammal(dolphin).
mammal(elephant).
mammal(human).
bird(albatross).
bird(seagull).
bird(ostrich).
bird(penguin).

% Using the `in` operator to check if an animal belongs to a certain category
?- X in  mammal.
% This query will return all the animals that belong to the `mammal` category
?- X in bird.
% This query will return all the animals that belong to the `bird` category

% Defining a rule to check if an animal is a descendant of another animal
descendant(X,Y):- ancestor(Y,X).

% Defining the gender of certain animals
% `male` and `female` are the two genders recognized in this knowledge base
male(chimpanzee).
male(dolphin).
male(elephant).
male(penguin).
female(seagull).
female(ostrich).
female(human).

% Using the `is` operator to check for equality between variables
?- X is Y.
% This query will return true if `X` and `Y` hold the same value, otherwise it will return false
