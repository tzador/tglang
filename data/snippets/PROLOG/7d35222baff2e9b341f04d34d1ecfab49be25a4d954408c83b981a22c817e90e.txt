%This is a prolog rule named "loop" that loops through a list and prints out the elements

loop([H | T]) :- %define the loop predicate with a list as an argument
    write(H), %write out the current element
    write(' '), %write a space for formatting
    loop(T). %recursive call to loop with the remainder of the list as argument
    
loop([]). %base case, when the list is empty, the loop ends

%Example query: loop([1, 2, 3, 4])

%Expected Output:
%1 2 3 4
