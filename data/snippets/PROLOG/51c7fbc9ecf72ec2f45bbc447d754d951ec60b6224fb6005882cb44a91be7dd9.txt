% This is a Prolog program that defines a recursive predicate for calculating the factorial of a number.

% The factorial predicate takes two arguments: the number whose factorial is to be calculated, and the result of the calculation.
% The result is initially set to 1 and updated as the recursion progresses.

factorial(N, Result) :-
    N =< 1, % Base case: when N is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1.
    Result is 1.

factorial(N, Result) :-
    N > 1, % Recursive case: when N is greater than 1, the factorial is calculated by multiplying N with the factorial of (N-1).
    Prev is N-1, % Define the previous number.
    factorial(Prev, PrevResult), % Recursively calculate the factorial of (N-1).
    Result is N * PrevResult. % Multiply N with the result of the factorial of (N-1).

% Example query: What is the factorial of 6?
% Query: factorial(6, X).
% Output: X = 720. % The factorial of 6 is 720.
