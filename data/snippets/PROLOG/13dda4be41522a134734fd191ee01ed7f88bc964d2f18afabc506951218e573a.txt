% This is a Prolog program that uses recursion to find the factorial of a number

% The first clause of factorial defines the base case where the factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(0, 1).

% The second clause of factorial defines the recursive case where N is multiplied by the factorial of N-1
factorial(N, F) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    factorial(N1, F1),
    F is N * F1.
    
% To test the program, we can query for the factorial of 5
?- factorial(5, F).
% The output should be 120, which is the factorial of 5.
