% Predicate to find the factorial of a number

factorial(0,1).     % Base case: 0 factorial is 1

factorial(N,F) :-   % Recursive case:
    N > 0,          % Check if N is greater than 0
    M is N - 1,     % Subtract 1 from N
    factorial(M,Y), % Get the factorial of M 
    F is Y * N.     % Multiply the factorial of M with N to get F
