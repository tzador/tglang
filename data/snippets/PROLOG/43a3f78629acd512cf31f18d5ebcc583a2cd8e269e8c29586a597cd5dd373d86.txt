% This is a predicate that reverses a list
reverseList([],[]). % If the list is empty, the reversed list is also empty
reverseList([Head|Tail], Reversed) :- % For a non-empty list, the reversed list is the reversed tail with the head appended to it
    reverseList(Tail, ReversedTail), % recursively call reverseList on the tail
    append(ReversedTail, [Head], Reversed). % append the reversed tail with the head to get the reversed list
