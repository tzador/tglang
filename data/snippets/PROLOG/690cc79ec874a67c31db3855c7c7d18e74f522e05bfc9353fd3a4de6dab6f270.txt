% This is a code snippet in PROLOG that checks if a given list is a palindrome
palindrome(List) :-                      % Define the predicate "palindrome" that takes in a list as an argument
    reverse(List, List).                 % Check if the reversed list is equal to the original list, if yes then it is a palindrome

reverse([], []).                         % Base case: reversing an empty list gives an empty list
reverse([Head|Tail], Reverse) :-         % Recursive case: split the list into Head (first element) and Tail (rest of the list)
    reverse(Tail, TailReverse),          % Reverse the Tail 
    append(TailReverse, [Head], Reverse).% Append the reversed Tail with the Head to get the reversed list
