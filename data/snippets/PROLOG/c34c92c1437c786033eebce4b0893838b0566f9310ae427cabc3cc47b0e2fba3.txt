% Define a predicate to calculate the factorial of a number
% Inputs: Number - integer
% Output: Factorial - integer

factorial(0, 1).                   % base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, Factorial) :-         % recursive case: factorial of N is Factorial
    N > 0,                        % N must be greater than 0 for a valid factorial
    N1 is N - 1,                  % define N1 as N minus 1
    factorial(N1, Factorial1),    % calculate the factorial of N1 and assign it to Factorial1
    Factorial is N * Factorial1.  % calculate the factorial of N and assign it to Factorial

% Example usage:
% ?- factorial(5, X).              % to calculate the factorial of 5 and assign it to X
% X = 120.                         % output: 120, the factorial of 5
