% This predicate finds all possible paths between two nodes in a directed graph.

% Adding an edge between two nodes
edge(a, b).
edge(a, c).
edge(b, d).
edge(c, d).
edge(d, e).
edge(d, f).
edge(e, g).
edge(f, g).

% Base case: If the two nodes are the same, then there is a path of length 0
path(X, X, []).

% Recursive case: Finding a path from node A to node C through node B
% If there is an edge from A to B and a path from B to C, then there is a path from A to C
path(A, C, [A, B | Path]) :-
  edge(A, B),
  path(B, C, Path).
