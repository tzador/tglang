% This is a Prolog program that implements a depth-first search algorithm

% base case for the search - if current state is the goal state, return the path
solve_dfs(State, Goal, Path)  :-
    path_dfs(State, Goal, [State], Path).

% recursive case for the search
solve_dfs(State, Goal, Path) :-
    path_dfs(State, Goal, [], Path).

% helper function that performs the depth-first search
path_dfs(State, Goal, Visited, [Goal|Visited]) :-
    % checks if current state is the goal state
    goal_state(State, Goal).

% recursive case for the search
path_dfs(State, Goal, Visited, Path) :-
    % generates the next possible state using a rule or facts
    next_state(State, Next),
    % checks if the next state has not already been visited
    \+ member(Next, Visited),
    % continues the search from the next state
    path_dfs(Next, Goal, [Next|Visited], Path).

% base case for the search - if current state is the goal state, return the path
goal_state(State, State).
