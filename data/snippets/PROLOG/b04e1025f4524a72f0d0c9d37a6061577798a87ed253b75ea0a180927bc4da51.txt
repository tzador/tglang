% Define a rule for sentence structure
sentence(Subject, Verb, Object) :- % A sentence contains a subject, verb, and an object
    noun(_, Subject), % The subject can be either singular or plural
    verb(_, Verb), % The verb can be either singular or plural
    noun(_, Object). % The object can be either singular or plural

% Define a rule for asking a question
ask(Question) :-
    write('Enter a sentence: '), % Prompt the user for a sentence
    read(X), % Read the sentence input
    sentence(Subject, Verb, Object, X), % Check if the input sentence follows the sentence structure rule
    write('Is the sentence a question?'), % Prompt the user to determine if the sentence is a question
    read(Answer), % Read the answer
    (Answer == yes -> Question = sentence(Verb, Subject, Object) ; Question = no). % If the answer is yes, flip the verb and subject, otherwise return "no"

% Define a rule for answering a question
answer(Verb, Subject, Object) :-
    write('Did '), write(Subject), write(' '), write(Verb), write(' '), write(Object), write('?'), % Prompt the user with the question
    read(Answer), % Read the user's answer
    (Answer == yes -> write('Yes!') ; write('No!')). % If the answer is yes, print "Yes!", otherwise print "No!"

% Example usage:
?- sentence(alice, eats, apples). % Check if the sentence "Alice eats apples" follows the sentence structure rule
true. % The sentence is true

true. % The sentence is true
?- sentence(carol, eats, bananas). % Check if the sentence "Carol eats bananas" follows the sentence structure rule
true. % The sentence is true

?- ask(Question). % Prompt the user to enter a sentence and determine if it is a question
Enter a sentence: Does Alice eat apples?
Is the sentence a question?
yes. % The sentence is a question
Question = sentence(eats, alice, apples). % The verb and subject are flipped to form the question

?- answer(eats, alice, apples). % Ask the user if "Alice eats apples" is true
Did alice eats apples?
yes. % The user confirms that the sentence is true
Yes! % The program prints "Yes!" to indicate that the answer is yes
