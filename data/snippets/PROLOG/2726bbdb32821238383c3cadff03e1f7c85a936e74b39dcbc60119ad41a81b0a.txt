/* This is a Prolog program for finding the sum of the first n natural numbers */

/* Define a predicate for finding the sum of the first n natural numbers */
sum(0, 0). /* Base case: the sum of zero natural numbers is zero */
sum(N, Result) :- N > 0, /* For N greater than zero */
    N1 is N - 1, /* Decrease N by 1 to find the sum of the previous natural numbers */
    sum(N1, Result1), /* Recursively find the sum of the previous natural numbers */
    Result is Result1 + N. /* Add N to the sum of the previous natural numbers for the final result */

/* Query the sum of the first 5 natural numbers */
?- sum(5, Result).

/* Example output:
Result = 15
