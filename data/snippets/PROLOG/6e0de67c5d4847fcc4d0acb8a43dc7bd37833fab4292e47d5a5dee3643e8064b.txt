% This is a Prolog program that uses built-in predicates and user-defined predicates to find the average age of a group of people.

% Define the predicate 'person' that takes 3 arguments
person(Name, Age, Gender).

% Initialize a group of people with their names, ages, and genders
person(john, 25, male).
person(sarah, 32, female).
person(mike, 28, male).
person(lisa, 34, female).
person(kevin, 21, male).

% Define the predicate 'group_average' that takes 2 arguments
group_average([], 0). % Base case: if the group is empty, the average is 0
group_average([person(_, Age, _)|T], Avg) :- group_average(T, Sum), % Recursive case: add up all the ages in the group, ignoring names and genders
											 Avg is Sum + Age, % Calculate the sum of the ages
											 length([person(_, Age, _)|T], N), % Get the length of the group
											 Avg is Avg / N. % Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length

% Query the group average of the group
?- group_average([person(john, 25, male), person(sarah, 32, female), person(mike, 28, male), person(lisa, 34, female), person(kevin, 21, male)], Avg).

% Output:
% Avg = 28.0
