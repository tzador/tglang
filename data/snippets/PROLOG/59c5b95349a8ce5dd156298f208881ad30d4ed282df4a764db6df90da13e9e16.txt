/*A predicate that checks if a list is a palindrome:*/

poly([], []).
poly([X], [X]).
poly([X|[X]], [X|X]).
poly([X|Xs], [X|Y|Xs]) :- append(Xs, [X], [Y|Z]), poly(Xs, Z).

/*Explanation:
- This predicate checks if a list is a palindrome.
- The first two rules handle the base cases, where an empty list and a list with one element are both considered palindromes.
- The third rule handles lists with two elements, where the first and last element should match.
- The recursive rule handles lists with more than two elements.
- The recursive rule uses the `append` predicate to split the input list into two parts, the first part being the first element and the last part being the rest of the list.
- The rule then recursively checks if the first and last elements match and continues checking the rest of the list until the base cases are reached.
