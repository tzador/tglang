% Definition of a predicate for finding the length of a list

len([], 0). % base case: length of an empty list is 0

len([_|T], N) :- len(T, N1), N is N1 + 1. % recursive case: length is 1 + length of the tail of the list

/*
Explanation:
The first line defines a predicate called 'len' with two arguments - a list and a number. 
The second line is the base case, stating that the length of an empty list is 0.
The third line is the recursive case, stating that the length of a list with a head and a tail is 1 more than the length of the tail. 
This recursively calls the 'len' predicate until the base case is reached.
