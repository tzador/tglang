% This is a simple Prolog program that checks if a given number is odd or even

% Function to check if the number is even
even(X) :-
    0 is X mod 2. % Check if the remainder of X divided by 2 is equal to 0

% Function to check if the number is odd
odd(X) :-
    not(even(X)). % Use the built-in predicate "not" to check if X is not even

% The main function that gets user input, checks if it's odd or even, and prints the result
main :-
    write('Enter a number: '), % Print message to prompt user for input
    read(X), % Read user input and store it in X variable
    even(X), % Call the even function to check if X is even
    write(X), write(' is even'). % Print the result if X is even
main :-
    write('Enter a number: '), % Otherwise, print message again to prompt user for input
    read(X), % Read user input and store it in X variable
    odd(X), % Call the odd function to check if X is odd
    write(X), write(' is odd'). % Print the result if X is odd

% Example query: main.
% Example input: 5
% Example output: 5 is odd
