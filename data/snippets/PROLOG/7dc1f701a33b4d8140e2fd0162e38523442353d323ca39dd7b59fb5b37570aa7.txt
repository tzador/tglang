% This is a comment in PROLOG
% It explains what the following lines of code do

% Defining a rule
double(X, Y) :-          % This rule takes in an input X and outputs Y
    Y is X * 2.          % The output Y is the input X multiplied by 2

% Defining a predicate
even(X) :-               % This predicate takes in an input X 
    0 is X mod 2.        % The input X is checked if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder

% Defining a database
father(john, bob).       % This database entry states that John is the father of Bob
father(bob, alex).       % This database entry states that Bob is the father of Alex
father(alex, jenny).     % This database entry states that Alex is the father of Jenny

% Defining a recursive rule
ancestor(X, Y) :-        % This recursive rule finds the ancestor of Y
    father(X, Y).        % The ancestor is any direct father of Y

ancestor(X, Y) :-        % If there is another ancestor, 
    father(Z, Y),        % The rule checks if Z is the father of Y
    ancestor(X, Z).      % And recursively checks if X is the ancestor of Z, making it the ancestor of Y
