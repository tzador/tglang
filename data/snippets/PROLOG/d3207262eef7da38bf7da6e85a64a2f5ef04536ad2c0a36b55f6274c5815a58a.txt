% Rules for calculating the factorial of a number
factorial(0, 1). % Base case - 0! = 1

factorial(N, Result) :- % Recursive case
    N > 0, % Ensures the number is positive
    N1 is N - 1, % Decrements N by 1
    factorial(N1, SubResult), % Recursive call to calculate (N-1)!
    Result is N * SubResult. % Calculate N! by multiplying with (N-1)!

% Example usage: ?- factorial(5, Result).
% Expected result: Result = 120. % 5! = 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
