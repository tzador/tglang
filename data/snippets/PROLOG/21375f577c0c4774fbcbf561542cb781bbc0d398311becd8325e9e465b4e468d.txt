% A knowledge base about people in a family tree
% Defining parent relationships
parent(alice, bob).
parent(bob, charlie).
parent(charlie, dave).
parent(dave, ellie).

% Defining grandparent relationships
grandparent(X, Z) :-
    parent(X, Y), % X is the grandparent if it is the parent of Y
    parent(Y, Z). % and Y is the parent of Z

% Defining sibling relationships
siblings(X, Y) :-
    parent(Z, X), % if X and Y have a common parent
    parent(Z, Y), % and that parent is Z
    X \= Y. % and X and Y are not the same person

% Defining aunt/uncle relationships
aunt_or_uncle(X, Y) :-
    siblings(X, Z), % X is an aunt/uncle if they are a sibling of a parent (Z) of Y
    parent(Z, Y).

% Defining cousin relationships
cousins(X, Y) :-
    parent(A, X), % A is a parent of X
    parent(B, Y), % B is a parent of Y
    siblings(A, B). % and A and B are siblings (X and Y are first cousins)

% Defining ancestor relationships
ancestor(X, Y) :-
    parent(X, Y). % X is an ancestor if they are the parent of Y
ancestor(X, Z) :-
    parent(X, Y), % or X is the parent of a parent (Y) of Z
    ancestor(Y, Z).

% Defining descendant relationships
descendant(Y, X) :-
    ancestor(X, Y). % X is a descendant if Y is an ancestor of X

% Finding all the ancestors of a person
% ancestor(alice, X) gives the list of all the ancestors of alice
