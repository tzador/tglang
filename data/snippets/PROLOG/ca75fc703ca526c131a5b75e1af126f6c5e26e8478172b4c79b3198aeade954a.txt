% This is a program that solves a Sudoku puzzle using Prolog.

% The puzzle is represented as a list of lists, with each sublist
% representing a row and each element in the sublist representing a column.
% Empty spaces are represented with a 0.

% Example puzzle:
% [ [1,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,8],
%   [4,5,6,0,8,0,2,1,9],
%   [7,8,9,0,4,5,3,6,2],
%   [0,1,0,3,0,0,7,8,4],
%   [0,0,0,4,0,9,6,0,3],
%   [0,4,0,2,7,0,0,9,5],
%   [0,7,0,6,0,4,0,2,1],
%   [0,0,3,0,2,0,5,4,6],
%   [0,0,5,7,9,8,0,3,0] ]

% Define a predicate to check if all elements in a list are unique.
unique([]). % If the list is empty, then all elements are unique.
unique([H|T]) :- % If the list is not empty, check if the head (H) is not in the tail (T).
    not(member(H,T)), % If H is not a member of T, then it is unique.
    unique(T). % Recursively check if the tail is also unique.

% Define a predicate to check if all rows in a puzzle have unique elements.
unique_rows(Puzzle) :-
    maplist(unique,Puzzle). % Apply the unique predicate to each row in Puzzle using maplist.

% Define a predicate to check if all columns in a puzzle have unique elements.
% This is achieved by transposing the puzzle and checking if the rows are unique.
unique_columns(Puzzle) :- transpose(Puzzle, Transposed), unique_rows(Transposed).

% Define a predicate to check if all 3x3 sub-grids in a puzzle have unique elements.
% This is achieved by splitting the puzzle into 3x3 sub-grids and checking if they are unique.
unique_subgrids(Puzzle) :-
    append([A1,A2,A3], Puzzle), % Split the puzzle into 3 lists (A1, A2, A3).
    length(A1, 3), %% Ensure that A1 has 3 elements.
    length(A2, 3), % Ensure that A2 has 3 elements.
    length(A3, 3), % Ensure that A3 has 3 elements.
    append([A4,A5,A6], Puzzle), % Split the puzzle into 3 lists (A4, A5, A6).
    length(A4, 3), % Ensure that A4 has 3 elements.
    length(A5, 3), % Ensure that A5 has 3 elements.
    length(A6, 3), % Ensure that A6 has 3 elements.
    append([A7,A8,A9], Puzzle), % Split the puzzle into 3 lists (A7, A8, A9).
    length(A7, 3), % Ensure that A7 has 3 elements.
    length(A8, 3), % Ensure that A8 has 3 elements.
    length(A9, 3), % Ensure that A9 has 3 elements.
    unique_rows([A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A9]). % Check if all sub-grids have unique elements.

% Define a predicate to combine all the uniqueness checks and solve the puzzle.
solve(Puzzle, Solution) :-
    unique_rows(Puzzle), % Check if all rows have unique elements.
    unique_columns(Puzzle), % Check if all columns have unique elements.
    unique_subgrids(Puzzle), % Check if all sub-grids have unique elements.
    fill_empty(Puzzle, Solution). % Fill in the empty spaces in the puzzle using backtracking.

% Define a predicate to fill in the empty spaces in the puzzle using backtracking.
fill_empty(Puzzle, Solution) :- helper(Puzzle, Solution), !. % Cut to prevent backtracking.

helper([], []). % If the puzzle is empty, the solution is also empty.
helper([H|T], [H|Ts]) :- % If the puzzle is not empty, check each row.
    select(0,H,T,NH), % Find the first empty space (0) and replace it with a number (1-9).
    helper(NH,Ts). % Recursively check the rest of the rows.

% Example puzzle with solution:
% [ [1,2,3,6,5,7,4,9,8],
%   [4,5,6,9,8,3,2,1,9],
%   [7,8,9,1,4,5,3,6,2],
%   [5,1,8,3,6,2,7,8,4],
%   [2,3,7,4,1,9,6,5,3],
%   [9,4,1,2,7,6,8,9,5],
%   [3,7,4,6,9,4,8,2,1],
%   [6,9,2,8,2,1,5,4,6],
%   [8,6,5,7,9,8,1,3,7] ]
