% Defining a predicate to check if a given number is prime
prime(N) :-     % Predicate name
    N > 1,      % Condition, number must be greater than 1
    Nn is N - 1,    % Nn is assigned the value of N - 1
    \+divisible(N, Nn). % Checks if N is not divisible by Nn using the 'divisible' predicate

% Defining the 'divisible' predicate to check if a number is divisible by another number
divisible(N, D) :-  % Predicate name, takes two arguments: N and D
    N mod D =:= 0.  % True if N is divisible by D with no remainder

% Defining a predicate to generate a list of prime numbers
primeList(Start, End, List) :- % Predicate name, takes three arguments: start, end, and list
    findall(Num, (between(Start, End, Num), prime(Num)), List). 
    % Uses the built-in 'findall' predicate to generate a list of prime numbers within a given range
    % 'between' is used to iterate from Start to End, and 'prime' checks if the number is prime

% Example query:
% ?- primeList(1, 10, L).
% L = [2, 3, 5, 7]  % Output of the list of prime numbers from 1 to 10
