% Define a predicate to find the maximum value in a list
maximum([X], X). % Base case: maximum of list with single element is that element
maximum([H|T], M):- % Recursion: find maximum of the tail and compare it to the head
 maximum(T, M1), % Recursive call to find maximum of tail
 (H > M1 % If head is greater than max of tail, then head is new maximum
  -> M = H % Assign head as new maximum
  ; M = M1 ). % Otherwise, max of tail remains the maximum
