%% Define a predicate for finding the length of a list
length([], 0). %% If list is empty, length is zero

length([_|T], N) :- %% If list is not empty, increase length by 1 and recurse through tail
   length(T, N1), %% recursively call length predicate on tail of list
   N is N1 + 1. %% Increase length by 1

?- length([1,2,3,4], L). %% Query the length of list [1,2,3,4]

%% Expected output:
%% L = 4 %% The length of list [1,2,3,4] is 4
