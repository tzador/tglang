%% A rule that checks if first argument is divisible by second argument
divisible(X, Y) :- 
    % if Y is 0, then X is not divisible by Y
    Y =\= 0,
    % if X is 0, then it is divisible by Y
    X =:= 0;
    % otherwise, check if X mod Y equals 0
    X mod Y =:= 0.

% Examples of using the divisible rule
divisible(10, 2).
% returns true, since 10 is divisible by 2
divisible(10, 3).
% returns false, since 10 is not divisible by 3
divisible(0, 5).
% returns true, since 0 is divisible by 5
