/* Defining a predicate 'sum_list' that calculates the sum of a list of numbers */
sum_list([], 0).
sum_list([Head|Tail], Sum) :-
    sum_list(Tail, Rest),       /* Recursive call to sum_list to get the sum of the rest of the list */
    Sum is Head + Rest.         /* Calculating the sum of the current number in the list and the sum of the rest of the list */

/* Sample query: sum_list([1, 2, 3], Sum). 
   This will calculate the sum of the list [1, 2, 3] and store it in the variable Sum */
