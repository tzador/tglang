% A simple Prolog program to calculate the sum of two numbers

% Defining the sum predicate
sum(X,Y,Z) :- 
        Z is X + Y. % Calculates the sum of X and Y and stores the result in Z

% Defining the main predicate to take input and output result
main:-
        write('Enter the first number: '), % Prompts the user to enter the first number
        read(Input1), % Reads the input and stores it in Input1
        write('Enter the second number: '), % Prompts the user to enter the second number
        read(Input2), % Reads the input and stores it in Input2
        sum(Input1, Input2, Result), % Calls the sum predicate with inputs as Input1 and Input2, and stores the result in Result
        format("Sum of ~w and ~w is ~w", [Input1, Input2, Result]). % Prints the final result

% Calling the main predicate to run the program
:- initialization(main).
