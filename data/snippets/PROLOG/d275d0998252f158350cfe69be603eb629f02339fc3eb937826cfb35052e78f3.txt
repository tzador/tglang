%% This is a program that creates a database of families and their relationships
%% each family is defined by the head of the household, their spouse, and their children
%% all the relationships are bi-directional, meaning if a is the parent of b, b is also the child of a

%% first, we define the predicates for family relationships in prolog
father(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y), male(X).
mother(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y), female(X).
child(X, Y) :- parent(Y, X).
son(X, Y) :- child(X, Y), male(X).
daughter(X, Y) :- child(X, Y), female(X).
sibling(X, Y) :- parent(Z, X), parent(Z, Y), X \= Y.
brother(X, Y) :- sibling(X, Y), male(X).
sister(X, Y) :- sibling(X, Y), female(X).
grandparent(X, Y) :- parent(P, Y), parent(X, P).
grandfather(X, Y) :- grandparent(X, Y), male(X).
grandmother(X, Y) :- grandparent(X, Y), female(X).
ancestor(X, Z) :- parent(X, Z).
ancestor(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), ancestor(Y, Z).

%% next, we define the families in our database
parent(john, jack).
parent(john, jill).
parent(mary, jack).
parent(mary, jill).
parent(jack, joe).
parent(jack, jane).

%% now, we can query our database
%% for example, we can ask who are the children of john and mary
?- father(john, X), mother(mary, X).

%% the output will be:
%% X = jack
%% X = jill
