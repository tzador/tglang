%This is a Prolog program that calculates n factorial (n!) recursively.

%The base case is n = 0, which results in factorial of 0 being 1.
factorial(0,1).

%For any other number n, recursively calculate (n-1)! and multiply it with n.
factorial(N, Result) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    factorial(N1, Result1),
    Result is N * Result1.

%Example query: factorial(5,X).
%Output: X = 120 (since 5! = 120)
