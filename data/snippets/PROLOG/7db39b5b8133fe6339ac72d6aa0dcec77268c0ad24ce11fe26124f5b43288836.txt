% This is a Prolog program that uses recursion to reverse a list.
% The predicate reverse_list takes in a list L and returns the reversed list R.
reverse_list(L,R) :-
    % Base case for an empty list.
    L = [],
    % The reversed list is also an empty list.
    R = [].
reverse_list(L,R) :-
    % Recursive case for a non-empty list.
    L = [Head|Tail],
    % The reversed list R1 is the reverse of the tail of the original list.
    reverse_list(Tail,R1),
    % The reversed list R is the concatenation of R1 and the head of the original list.
    R = [Head|R1].
