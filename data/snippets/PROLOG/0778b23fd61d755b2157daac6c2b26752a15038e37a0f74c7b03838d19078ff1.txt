% A predicate that determines if a list contains only distinct elements.

% Base case, the empty list has distinct elements.
distinct([]).

% Recursive case, check if the tail of the list does not contain the head element.
distinct([Head|Tail]) :-
    \+member(Head, Tail), % 'member' checks if an element is a member of a list.
    distinct(Tail). % Recursive call with updated list.

/* Example query: distinct([1,2,3]). 
   Expected Output: yes.
