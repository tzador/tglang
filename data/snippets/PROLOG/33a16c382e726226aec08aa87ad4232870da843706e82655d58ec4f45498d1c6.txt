% A predicate that returns the factorial of a given number

factorial(0,1).            
% Base case: 0 factorial is 1.

factorial(N,F) :-          
% Recursive case.

N>0,                       % Ensures that N is a positive integer.
Next is N-1,               % Next is used to decrement N by 1 in each recursive call.
factorial(Next,SubF),      % Recursively calls factorial with N-1 and stores the result in SubF.
F is N*SubF.               % Multiplies N with SubF to get the factorial of N.
