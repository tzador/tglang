%% A predicate to check if two lists are equal
equal_lists([],[]).                 % If both lists are empty, they are equal
equal_lists([H1|T1], [H2|T2]) :-   % If both lists are non-empty
    H1 =:= H2,                     % Check if first elements are equal
    equal_lists(T1,T2).             % Recursively check the rest of the lists

?- equal_lists([1,2,3], [1,2,3]).     % Query to check if [1,2,3] is equal to [1,2,3]
Yes.                              % Output: Yes, the lists are equal.
