/*
This code snippet is a knowledge base and set of predicates in the PROLOG programming language. It first defines the fact that birds and bats can fly, while humans cannot. Next, it sets up predicates to define properties of different animals. For example, the predicate mammal is defined as something that is either a dog, bat, or human. The predicate bird is defined using the earlier can_fly fact. Lastly, the code defines more specific properties for each type of animal, such as dogs that bark, bats that fly, and humans that can speak. All of this information can be used to answer questions and make logical inferences about animal properties. */
