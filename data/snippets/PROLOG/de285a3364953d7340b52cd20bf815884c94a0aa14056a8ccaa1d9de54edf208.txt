/* This is a PROLOG code snippet that defines a predicate named "listSum" that takes in two arguments, a list of numbers and a variable "Sum" that represents the sum of all the numbers in the list. */

/* The first line initializes the predicate and its arguments. */
listSum([], 0).

/* The next line defines the recursive case where the list has at least one element. It takes the first element of the list as "Head" and the rest of the list as "Tail". */
listSum([Head|Tail], Sum) :-
    /* The recursive call line calls the predicate again with the rest of the list as the argument and a new variable "NewSum" which represents the sum of all the remaining elements in the list. */
    listSum(Tail, NewSum),
    /* The next line performs the addition of "Head" and "NewSum" and assigns the result to "Sum". */
    Sum is Head + NewSum.

/* Example query: listSum([1,2,3,4], Sum). */
/* Output: Sum = 10 */
/* This queries the predicate with a list [1,2,3,4] and the variable "Sum" is unified with the sum of all the numbers in the list, which is 10. */
