/* A rule for calculating the sum of a list of numbers */

calculate_sum([], 0). % Base case for empty list, sum is 0

calculate_sum([H|T], Sum) :- % Recursive case, H is the head of the list, T is the tail
    calculate_sum(T, NewSum), % Recursive call to calculate the sum of the tail
    Sum is H + NewSum. % Calculate sum by adding head to sum of tail

/* Example query: calculate_sum([1,2,3], Sum). Output: Sum = 6 */
