% Defining a rule that adds two numbers
add(X,Y,Z) :- % add is the name of the rule
    Z is X + Y. % Definition of the rule - Z is the result of adding X and Y

% Defining a rule for checking if a number is even
even(X) :-
    0 is X mod 2. % X mod 2 gives the remainder when X is divided by 2, if it is 0 then X is even

% Defining a rule to check if a list has two elements
two_elements_list(L) :-
    length(L,2). % length is a built-in predicate in PROLOG to find the number of elements in a list

% Defining a rule to find the maximum of two numbers
max(X,Y,Max) :-
    X >= Y,     % If X is greater than or equal to Y
    Max is X.   % Then Max is X, since X is the maximum
max(X,Y,Max) :-
    Y > X,      % If Y is greater than X
    Max is Y.   % Then Max is Y, since Y is the maximum

% Defining a recursive rule to find the factorial of a number
factorial(0,1).      % Factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N,F) :-
    N > 0,            % If N is greater than 0
    N1 is N - 1,      % Decrement N by 1
    factorial(N1,F1), % Call the rule again with N = N1
    F is N * F1.      % F is the result of multiplying N with the factorial of N1
