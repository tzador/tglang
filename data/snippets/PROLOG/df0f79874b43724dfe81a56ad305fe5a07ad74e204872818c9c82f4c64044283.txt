% This is a Prolog code snippet that finds the factorial of a number using recursion

% Base case when the number is 1, the factorial is 1
factorial(1, 1).

% Recursive case when number is greater than 1
factorial(N, Result) :-
    N > 1,
    % Reduce the number by 1 for each recursive call
    N1 is N - 1,
    % Recursive call to find the factorial of the reduced number
    factorial(N1, Result1),
    % Calculate the factorial of the original number by multiplying with the factorial of the reduced number
    Result is N * Result1.
