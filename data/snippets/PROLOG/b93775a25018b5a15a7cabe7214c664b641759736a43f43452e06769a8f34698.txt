%% Define a predicate that calculates the factorial of a given number.
factorial(0, 1). % Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N, Result) :- % Recursive case
    N > 0,  % Check if N is a positive integer
    N1 is N - 1,  % Decrease N by 1
    factorial(N1, Result1),  % Recursively calculate the factorial of N-1
    Result is N * Result1.  % Multiply N by the factorial of N-1 to get the final result


?-
factorial(5, Result).
% Expected output: Result = 120
