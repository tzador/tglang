% Define a rule for calculating the factorial of a number
factorial(0,1).    % The factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(X,Y) :-    % Define a rule for calculating the factorial for any other number
    X > 0,    % The number must be greater than 0
    X1 is X - 1,    % Define a new variable X1 which is 1 less than the original number
    factorial(X1,Y1),    % Recursively call the factorial rule with the new number
    Y is X * Y1.    % Calculate the factorial by multiplying the original number with the factorial of the new number
