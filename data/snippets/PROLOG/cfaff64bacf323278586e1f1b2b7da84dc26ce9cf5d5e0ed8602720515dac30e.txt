% Define a predicate that takes in a list and returns the length of the list

% The "list_length" predicate takes in two arguments, a list and a variable "N"
% "N" will be assigned the length of the list
list_length([], 0). % If the list is empty, its length is 0
list_length([_|T], N) :- % If the list is not empty, take off the head and process the tail
    list_length(T, M), % Recursively call list_length on the tail, assigning its length to variable "M"
    N is M + 1. % The length of the original list is "M" + 1 (since we removed the head)

% Query example: list_length([1,2,3,4], N) 
% Output: N = 4
