% This is a PROLOG program that defines a relation for finding the area of a triangle given the base and height.
% The area is calculated using the formula: (base * height) / 2

area_triangle(Base, Height, Area) :-     % Define the relation with three arguments - Base, Height and Area
    Area is (Base * Height) / 2.         % Calculate the area and assign it to the Area variable

?- area_triangle(5, 4, Area).            % Query the relation with specific values for Base and Height
% The output will be: Area = 10.          % The calculated area will be returned as the output
