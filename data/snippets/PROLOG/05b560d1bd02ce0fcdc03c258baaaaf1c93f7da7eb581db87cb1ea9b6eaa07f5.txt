% Define predicate to check if a list contains an element
contains(List, Element) :-
    % Check if head of list is equal to element
    List = [Head|_],
    Head = Element.
    
% Recursively check remaining elements of list
contains(List, Element) :-
    % Check if list is not empty
    List = [_|Tail],
    % Recursive call with remaining elements
    contains(Tail, Element). % This will keep checking until an element is found or the list is empty
