mul(A, B, C) :- % multiplies A and B, and sets the product as C
    A = 0,       % base case for recursion
    C is 0.      % set C to 0
mul(A, B, C) :- % recursive case
    A > 0,       % check if A is greater than 0
    A1 is A - 1, % decrement A by 1
    mul(A1, B, C1), % recursively call mul with A1 and B, set the result as C1
    C is C1 + B. % set C to C1 plus B (each recursive call adds B to the running total)
