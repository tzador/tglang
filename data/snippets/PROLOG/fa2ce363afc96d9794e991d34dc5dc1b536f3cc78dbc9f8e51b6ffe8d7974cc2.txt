/* This is a prolog code snippet that defines a "has_object" predicate
   that takes in two arguments, the first being a person and the second
   being an object, and checks if the person has that object in their
   possession. */

% Define base case where a person does not have any objects in their possession
has_object(Person, Object) :-
    house(Person, []),
    write(Person),
    write(" does not currently have any objects in their possession.").

% Define recursive case where person's possession list is not empty
has_object(Person, Object) :-
    house(Person, Objects),
    Objects = [H|T], % Split possession list into head and tail
    (H = Object
    -> write(Person),
       write(" has "),
       write(Object),
       write(" in their possession.")
    ; has_object(Person, Object)). % Recursive call with tail of possession list

% Example query: does joe have a pencil?
?- has_object(joe, pencil).
% Output: joe has pencil in his possession.
