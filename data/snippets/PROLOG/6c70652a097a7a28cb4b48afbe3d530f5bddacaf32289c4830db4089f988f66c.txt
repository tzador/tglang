% This is a rule that checks for divisibility of two numbers.
divisible(X, Y) :- % ':-' denotes a rule or clause in Prolog.
    Y =:= 0, % '=:=' is the arithmetic equal to operator.
    !, % '!' denotes a cut, which stops Prolog from backtracking.
    fail. % If the condition above is satisfied, the rule fails.
divisible(X, Y) :- % A second rule if the first condition fails.
    Z is X mod Y, % 'is' is the assignment operator, 'mod' is the modulo operator.
    Z =:= 0. % If Z is 0, the rule succeeds.
