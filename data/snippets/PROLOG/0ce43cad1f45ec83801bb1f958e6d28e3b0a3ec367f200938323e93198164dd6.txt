%% This is a Prolog program that checks whether a given number is prime or not

%% Define a predicate to check if the number is divisible by another number
divisible(X,Y) :-
    %% Divide X by Y, if the remainder is 0 then X is divisible by Y
    0 is X mod Y.

%% Define a predicate to check if a number is prime, takes in a number and checks if it is divisible by any number less than itself
prime(2) :- !.
prime(3) :- !.
prime(X) :-
    %% Check if X is an even number
    X > 2,
    0 is X mod 2,
    !, fail.
%% Check if X is divisible by any number from 3 to its square root
prime(X) :-
    X > 3,
    %% Calculate the square root of X and round it down
    Y is floor(sqrt(X)),
    %% Use a recursive predicate to check if X is divisible by any number from 3 to its square root
    %!/1 is used to prevent backtracking and improve performance
    \+ divisible(X,Y+1).
