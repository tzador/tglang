% This is a Prolog program that implements a predicate for checking if a list is sorted in ascending order

% Base case for empty list
isSorted([]).

% Recursive rule for checking sorted list
% Takes the head and tail of the list as arguments
isSorted([H|T]) :-
    % Check if tail is empty list, indicating end of list
    isSorted(T), 
  
    % Check if head is less than or equal to the first element of tail
    H =< T.
