% This is a PROLOG program that calculates the power of a number.

% The power function takes two arguments, the base and exponent.
power(Base, 0, 1). % Base to the power of 0 is always 1.
power(Base, Exponent, Result) :-
    Exponent > 0, % Ensure that exponent is positive.
    NewExponent is Exponent - 1, % Decrement the exponent by 1.
    power(Base, NewExponent, TempResult), % Using recursion to calculate power.
    Result is TempResult * Base. % Multiplies the base by the calculated power.

% Query to calculate the power of 3 to the 4th power.
?- power(3, 4, Result).
% Output: Result = 81

% Query to calculate the power of 2 to the 5th power.
?- power(2, 5, Result).
% Output: Result = 32
