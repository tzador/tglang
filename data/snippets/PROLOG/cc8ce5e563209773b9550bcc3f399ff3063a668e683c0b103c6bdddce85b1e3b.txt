/* This is a Prolog program that uses a predicate to find the shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph.

First, we define the predicate 'reachable/2' which takes two arguments: the start node and the end node. The predicate will recursively find a path between the two nodes using the 'edge/2' facts that define the directed graph.

Next, we define the predicate 'shortest_path/3' which takes three arguments: the start node, the end node and the shortest path between them. To find the shortest path, we use the built-in predicate 'setof/3' to generate a list of all possible paths between the start and end node using the 'reachable/2' predicate. Then, we use the 'length/2' predicate to get the length of each path and find the shortest one using the built-in predicate 'min_list/2'.

Finally, we define the 'edge/2' facts which define the directed graph. In this example, we are using a simple graph with six nodes and six directed edges.

To test this program, we can query the predicate 'shortest_path/3' with different start and end nodes to find the shortest paths between them. */
