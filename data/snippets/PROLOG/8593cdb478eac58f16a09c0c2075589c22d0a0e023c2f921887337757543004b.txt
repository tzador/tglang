% Creating a predicate to check if a list is a palindrome
% The palindrome predicate takes in a list as input, and checks if the first and last element are the same
% If they are, then it removes them from the list and recursively checks the remaining list until either the list is empty or only one element is left

palindrome(List) :-
    % Checking if the list is empty or only has one element left, which are automatically palindromes
    length(List, N),
    (
        N = 0;
        N = 1
    ),
    !.

palindrome(List) :-
    % Removing the first and last element from the list and checking if they are equal
    append([First | Middle], [Last], List),
    % If they are equal, then recursively check the remaining list
    % Otherwise, the list is not a palindrome
    First = Last,
    palindrome(Middle).
