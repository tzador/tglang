/*
This code snippet creates a predicate that determines if a list has an odd number of elements.
The predicate takes in a list and returns true if the number of elements is odd, false if it is even.
*/

% Predicate to check if a list has odd number of elements
check_odd_length(List) :-
    % Base case: an empty list has even number of elements
    List = [], 
    false. 

check_odd_length(List) :-
    % If list has only one element, it is odd
    List = [_], 
    true.

check_odd_length(List) :-
    % List has more than one element, recursively check tail of list 
    [_|Tail] = List, 
    % Negate the result of recursive call since we are checking for odd length
    not(check_odd_length(Tail)).
