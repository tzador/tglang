%% Rules for calculating the factorial of a number
factorial(0,1). %base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N,F) :- %recursive case: factorial of N is F
    N>0, %N must be a positive number
    N1 is N - 1, %decrement N by 1 to get N1
    factorial(N1,F1), %recursive call to calculate factorial of N1
    F is N * F1. %multiply N with F1 to get the factorial of N
