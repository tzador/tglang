%% This is a Prolog code snippet.
%% It defines a predicate for determining the factorial of a number.

% Support for calculating the factorial of number 0.
factorial(0, 1).

% Support for calculating the factorial of number N.
factorial(N, Result) :-
    % Check if N is greater than 0.
    N > 0,
    % Calculate the factorial of N-1.
    N1 is N-1,
    factorial(N1, Result1),
    % Multiply the result with N to get the final factorial.
    Result is N * Result1.
