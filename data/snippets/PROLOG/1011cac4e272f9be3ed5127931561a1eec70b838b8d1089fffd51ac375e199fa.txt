% Define a predicate for finding the factorial of a given number
factorial(0,1). % Base case, factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(N,F) :- N>0, % Recursive case, if N is greater than 0
N1 is N - 1, % Decrease N by 1
factorial(N1,F1), % Get the factorial of N-1
F is N * F1. % Calculate the factorial of N by multiplying it with the factorial of N-1

% Define a predicate for finding the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci(0,0). % Base case, nth term of Fibonacci sequence is 0 when n = 0
fibonacci(1,1). % Base case, nth term of Fibonacci sequence is 1 when n = 1
fibonacci(N,F) :- N>1, % Recursive case, if N is greater than 1
N1 is N - 1, % Decrease N by 1
N2 is N - 2, % Decrease N by 2
fibonacci(N1,F1), % Get the (N-1)th term of Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci(N2,F2), % Get the (N-2)th term of Fibonacci sequence
F is F1 + F2. % Calculate the nth term by adding (N-1)th and (N-2)th term
