/* This is a code snippet in PROLOG */ 

% Defining a list of numbers to perform arithmetic operations on 
numbers([2,5,7,10,3]).

% Predicate to calculate the sum of a list of numbers 
sum([], 0). % Base case: when list is empty, sum is 0 
sum([H|T], Total) :- % Recursive case: 
    sum(T, Rest), % Recursive call to calculate sum of rest of the list 
    Total is H + Rest. % Calculate sum by adding head of list to sum of rest 

?- numbers(NumList), % Query to retrieve list of numbers 
   sum(NumList, Sum), % Call sum predicate on list of numbers 
   write('The sum of the numbers in the list is: '), % Print output 
   write(Sum). % Print calculated sum 

/* Output: 
The sum of the numbers in the list is: 27
