%% Defining facts about animals and their food
  %% These facts will be used to determine what animals can be fed to which animals
  food(zebra, grass).
  food(lion, zebra).
  food(giraffe, leaves).
  food(gazelle, leaves).
  food(tiger, gazelle).
  food(hawk, rabbit).
  food(eagle, rabbit).

  %% Defining rules for what animal can eat what food
  %% This rule looks at the first item in the list and checks if the second item is food
  can_eat(Animal, Food) :-
      food(Animal, Food).

  %% If the first item is not food, it checks for intermediate animals that can eat the food
  %% For example, if an animal can eat rabbits, and rabbits can eat leaves, then the animal can also eat leaves
  can_eat(Animal, Food) :-
      food(IntermediateAnimal, Food),
      can_eat(Animal, IntermediateAnimal).

  %% Querying the database to see what animals can eat what food
  %% This query will return true if an animal can eat a specific food
  %% For example, can_eat(lion, leaves) will return true since lions can eat zebras which eat grass, and grass is also a food
  ?- can_eat(lion, Food).

  %% Another example query, can_eat(hawk, leaves) will return false since hawks cannot eat leaves directly and none of the intermediate animals can either
  ?- can_eat(hawk, leaves).
