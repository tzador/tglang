%% Define a predicate to find the length of a list
%% Inputs:
%% - List: the given list
%% - Length: the variable to store the length of the list
%% Base case, when the list is empty, the length is 0
findLength([],0). 
%% Recursive case, increment length and recurse on the tail of the list
findLength([_|T], Length) :- 
    findLength(T, NewLength), % recursion to calculate length of tail
    Length is NewLength + 1. % increment length by 1 for each recursion

/*
Example usage:

?- findLength([1,2,3], Length).
Length = 3.
