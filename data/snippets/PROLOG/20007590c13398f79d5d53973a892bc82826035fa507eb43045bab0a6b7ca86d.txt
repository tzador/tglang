% Prolog program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N

% Function to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N
sum(0, 0). % Base case, sum of 0 is 0
sum(N, S) :- N1 is N-1, % Recursive rule to calculate the sum
             sum(N1, S1),
             S is S1+N.

% Query to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10
