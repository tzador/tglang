/* This program checks whether a given number is prime or not.
A number is prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.*/

% This is a predicate to check if the number is prime or not.
is_prime(2).  
is_prime(3).
is_prime(N) :-
  integer(N),        % checks if N is an integer
  N > 3,             % checks if N is greater than 3
  N mod 2 =\= 0,     % checks if N is not divisible by 2
  \+ has_factor(N,3). % checks if N has no other prime factors

% This is a predicate to check if there exists any prime factor of N.
has_factor(N,L) :- 
  N mod L =:= 0.     % checks if N is divisible by L
has_factor(N,L) :-
  L * L < N,         % checks if the square of L is less than N
  L2 is L + 2,       % increments L by 2
  has_factor(N,L2).  % recursively checks for other factors of N

% This is a query to check if the number 17 is prime.
?- is_prime(17).    % should return true as 17 is a prime number
