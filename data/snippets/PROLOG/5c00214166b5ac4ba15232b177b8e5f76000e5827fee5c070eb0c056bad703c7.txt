%% Rules for calculating the factorial of a number
factorial(0,1). %% Base case: 0 factorial is 1
factorial(N,Result) :- %% Recursive case
    N > 0, %% Negative numbers do not have a factorial
    Prev is N-1, %% Calculate factorial of previous number
    factorial(Prev,PrevFactorial), %% Get the factorial of previous number
    Result is N * PrevFactorial. %% Calculate factorial of current number
