% Rule for recursive factorial function
factorial(0, 1). % Base case: 0! is 1
factorial(N, Result) :- % Recursive case: N! is N * (N-1)!
    N > 0, % Check that N is a positive integer
    N1 is N - 1, % Calculate N-1
    factorial(N1, Result1), % Call factorial on N-1 and store the result
    Result is N * Result1. % Calculate N * (N-1)!
