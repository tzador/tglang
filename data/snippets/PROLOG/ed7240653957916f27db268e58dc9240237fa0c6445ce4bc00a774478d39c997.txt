% A prolog program to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers using recursion

% Define a predicate for finding the GCD of two numbers
gcd(A,0,A).
gcd(A,B,GCD) :- B > 0, R is A mod B, gcd(B,R,GCD).

/* The first line defines the base case
where if the second number is 0, the GCD will be the first number. 
The second line defines the recursive case, 
where the remainder (R) after dividing A by B is calculated 
and then the GCD is found recursively 
by passing B and R as arguments to the gcd predicate. */

?- gcd(10,15,GCD).
/* The query to find the GCD of 10 and 15 is executed 
and the value of GCD is returned as the output. */

/* Output:
GCD = 5 */
