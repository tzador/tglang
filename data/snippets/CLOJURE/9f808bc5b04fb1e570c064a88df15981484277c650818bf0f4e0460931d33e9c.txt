;; Define a function that takes in a collection and returns a new collection with the first element removed
(defn remove-first [coll]
  (conj (pop coll) (peek coll)))

;; Create a vector to test the function
(def test-vector [1 2 3 4])

;; Print out the original vector
(test-vector) ;; => [1 2 3 4]

;; Pass the vector through the remove-first function and print the result
(remove-first test-vector) ;; => [2 3 4]
