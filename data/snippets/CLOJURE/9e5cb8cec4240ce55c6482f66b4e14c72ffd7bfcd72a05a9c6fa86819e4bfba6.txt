;; Define a function called increment that takes in a number and adds 1 to it
(defn increment [number]
  (+ number 1))

;; Create a map containing various fruits and their corresponding prices
(def fruits {"apple" 2.50
             "orange" 1.50
             "banana" 1.00})

;; Define a function that calculates the total cost of purchasing a specific number of fruits
(defn calculate-total-cost [fruit quantity]
  (* (fruits fruit) quantity))

;; Call the increment function on 10, resulting in 11
(increment 10)

;; Call the calculate-total-cost function on "apple" with a quantity of 2, resulting in a total cost of 5.00
(calculate-total-cost "apple" 2)
