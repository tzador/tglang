;;function to calculate the factorial of a number
(defn factorial [n]
  ;;define a recur function with two arguments, sum and a counter i
  ((fn recur [sum i]
    ;;check if i is greater than n, if yes return the sum
    (if (> i n)
      sum
      ;;else recursively call the recur function with updated sum and i+1
      (recur (* sum i) (inc i))))
  ;;initialize the sum to 1 and i to 1
  1 1))
  
;;example call to factorial function with argument 5
(factorial 5)
