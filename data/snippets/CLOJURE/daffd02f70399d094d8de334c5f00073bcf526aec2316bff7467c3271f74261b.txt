(defn partition-nums
"A function that takes in a list of numbers and partitions them into sublists of even and odd numbers."
[numbers]
  (let [even? #(-> % (mod 2) zero?) ; defining a function to check if a number is even
        even (filter even? numbers) ; creating a list of even numbers using the even? function
        odd (filter (complement even?) numbers)] ; creating a list of odd numbers
    (vector even odd))) ; returning a vector with both sublists
    
; Example usage:
(partition-nums [1 2 3 4 5 6])
; Output: [[2 4 6] [1 3 5]]

; Another example usage:
(partition-nums [17 82 5 49 36])
; Output: [[82 36] [17 5 49]]
