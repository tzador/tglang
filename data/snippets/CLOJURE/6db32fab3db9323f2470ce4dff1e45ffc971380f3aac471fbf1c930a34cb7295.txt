;This code snippet is a clojure function that checks if a number is prime.

(defn is-prime [n] ;Defines a function named "is-prime" that takes the number as an argument.
  (if (<= n 1) ;Checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, which is not prime.
    false ;Returns false if the number is less than or equal to 1.
    (not (some #(zero? (rem n %)) ;Not operator to check the result of the some function, which takes a function and a collection and returns true if any element of the collection satisfies the function.
                  (range 2 (inc (Math/sqrt n))))))) ;Creates a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, and checks if any of those numbers divide n with 0 remainder.
