;; This code snippet contains a function called "calculate-fibonacci" that takes in a number "n" as input and recursively calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence.

(defn calculate-fibonacci
  "A function that takes in a number n and recursively calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence."
  [n]
  (if (< n 2)
    n
    (+ (calculate-fibonacci (- n 1)) (calculate-fibonacci (- n 2)))) ; Recursively calls the function, passing in n-1 and n-2 as parameters and adding their values together.
