(defn recursive-func [input]
  ;; This function takes in an input and recursively calls itself until the input becomes 0
  (if (= input 0)
    ;; Base case: if input is 0, return empty list
    []
    ;; Recursive case: call function again with input reduced by 1 and append to output list
    (cons input (recursive-func (- input 1)))))
    
;; Example call of recursive-func with input 5
