;; Function to generate a mathematical sequence of numbers
(defn math-seq
  "Generates a sequence of numbers based on input parameters: 
  - start: starting number of the sequence 
  - diff: difference between each number in the sequence 
  - length: number of numbers in the sequence"
  [start diff length]
  (let [nums (take length (iterate #(+ % diff) start))]
    nums))

;; Example of calling the function and storing the result in a variable
(def my-sequence (math-seq 1 3 10))
