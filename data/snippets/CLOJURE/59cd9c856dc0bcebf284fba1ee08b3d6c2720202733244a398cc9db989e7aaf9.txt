;; Defining a function to calculate the factorial of a number:
(defn factorial [n]
  "Calculates the factorial of a number"
  (let [result 1] ;; Creating a local variable to store the calculated result
    (loop [i 2] ;; Setting up a loop with initial value 2
      (if (<= i n) ;; Checking if the loop counter 'i' is less than or equal to the input number 'n'
        (recur
          (* result i) ;; Multiplying the result by the current loop counter value
          (inc i)) ;; Incrementing the loop counter by 1
        result)))) ;; Returning the final result

;; Calling the factorial function and printing the result:
(println "Factorial of 5 is:" (factorial 5)) ;; Output: "Factorial of 5 is: 120"
