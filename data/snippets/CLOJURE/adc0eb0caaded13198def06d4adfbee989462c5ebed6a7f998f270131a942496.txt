;; Defining a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
(defn factorial [n]
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
    
;; In this example, the factorial function is defined using the "defn" keyword, which is used for creating functions.
;; The function takes in one parameter, 'n'.
;; It uses the "if" statement which checks if the value of 'n' is less than or equal to 1.
;; If this condition is satisfied, the function returns 1.
;; If not, it uses the "*" operator to multiply 'n' with the result of calling the factorial function with 'n' decremented by 1.
;; This process continues until 'n' reaches 1, at which point the function returns the factorial value.
;; Example usage:
(factorial 5)
;; Output: 120
