;; This function takes in two parameters, x and y
;; and multiplies them together using the Clojure function *
(defn multiply [x, y]
   (* x y))   ;; The * symbol is used to indicate multiplication in Clojure.

;; This expression calls the multiply function with the numbers 5 and 10 as arguments
(multiply 5 10)   ;; Output: 50

;; This function calculates the factorial of a given number n
(defn factorial [n]
   (if (= n 1) 1      ;; If n is equal to 1, return 1 (base case)
       (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))   ;; Otherwise, multiply n with the factorial of n-1

;; This expression calls the factorial function with the number 5 as an argument
(factorial 5)   ;; Output: 120
