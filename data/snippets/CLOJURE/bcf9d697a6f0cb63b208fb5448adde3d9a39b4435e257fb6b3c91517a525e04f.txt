;;Define an add function which takes in two parameters
(defn add [a b]
 ;;Check if the parameters are numbers, if not, throw an error
 (if (and (number? a) (number? b))
 ;;If both parameters are numbers, add them and return the result
 (+ a b)
 ;;If any of the parameters is not a number, throw an error with a custom message
 (throw (str "Error: Cannot add " a " and " b " as they are not both numbers."))))
 
 ;;Define an add five function which uses partial application to add 5 to any value passed in
 (def add-five (partial add 5))
 
 ;;Call the add function with two numbers as parameters 
 (add 10 5) ;;Output: 15
 
 ;;Call the add-five function with a single number as parameter
 (add-five 10) ;;Output: 15
 
 ;;Call the add function with a number and a non-number as parameters
 (add 10 "abc") ;;Output: Error: Cannot add 10 and abc as they are not both numbers.
