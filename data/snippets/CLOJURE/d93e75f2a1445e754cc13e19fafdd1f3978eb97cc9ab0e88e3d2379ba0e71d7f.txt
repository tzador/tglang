;; Defining a function that takes in two arguments and returns the sum of their squares
(defn sum-of-squares [a b] 
  (+ (* a a) (* b b))) 
;; Defining a function that takes in a list as an argument and returns a new list with the elements squared
(defn square-list [lst] 
  (map #(sum-of-squares % 0) lst))
;; Use the square-list function to square a list of numbers
(square-list [1 2 3 4]) 
;; Expected output: (1 4 9 16)
