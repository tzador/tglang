;; This function takes in a vector and returns the number of elements in the vector
(defn count-elements [v]
  ;; Base case: if vector is empty, return 0
  (if (empty? v)
    0
    ;; Recursive case: add 1 to the count of elements in the rest of the vector
    (+ 1 (count-elements (rest v)))
  )
)

(count-elements [1 2 3 4 5]) ;; Output: 5 - the number of elements in the vector is 5
