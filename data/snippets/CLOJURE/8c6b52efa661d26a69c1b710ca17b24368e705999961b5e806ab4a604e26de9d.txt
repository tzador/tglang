;; Annotate the code snippet
In the namespace "my-project", we require the clojure.string library under the alias "str" and import the Date and URLEncoder classes from the java.util and java.net packages respectively.

Then we define a function "count-characters" that takes in an "input-string" parameter and performs the following steps:

1. Split the input string using the "split" function from the clojure.string library, passing in an empty string as the separator.
2. Use the "reduce" function to iterate over the resulting list and update the character counts for each character in the input string. The anonymous function uses the "update" function to update the character count in the first argument, and the "fnil" function with "inc 0" as the default value in case the character count does not exist in the map yet.
3. The result is stored in the "char-counts" variable and returned as the output of the function.

We can then call the "count-characters" function with any string as the input and it will return a map containing the character counts for each letter in the string.
