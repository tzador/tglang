  "This is a recursive function that calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence."
  "It takes in a single parameter, n, which indicates which number in the sequence to calculate."
  "The base cases are 1 and 0, where the function simply returns n."
  "For any other value of n, the function recursively calls itself with n-1 and n-2, and adds the results together."
  "This continues until the base cases are reached, and the final result is returned.")
