(comment "This function calculates the factorial of a number 
by using a recursive loop. The initial value of product is set to 1 
and the index i is set to 1. The loop continues until i is equal to the given number n, 
multiplying the current product by the current index at each iteration. 
Once i reaches the value of n, the final product is returned. 
If n is less than or equal to 1, the function returns 1 as the factorial value is 1 for n = 0 and n = 1. 
This function demonstrates the use of recursion and looping in Clojure programming.")
