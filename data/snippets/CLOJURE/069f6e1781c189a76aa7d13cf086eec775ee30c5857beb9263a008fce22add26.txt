(defn recurse [n]
  "A recursive function that returns the factorial of a given number 'n'. In Clojure, a function is defined with 'defn' followed by the function name, any parameters, and the function body within square brackets."
  (if (= n 0)
    1                                        ; Base case: if n = 0, return 1 as the factorial of 0 is defined as 1
    (* n (recurse (- n 1)))))                ; Recursive case: multiplies n with the result of the function called on n-1
(recurse 5)                                  ; Calling the function with a parameter of 5 will return the factorial of 5, which is 120.
