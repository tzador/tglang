;; Defines a function called "factorial"
(defn factorial [n]
  ;; 1. Checks if n is equal to 0
  ;; 2. If so, return 1
  ;; 3. If not, recursively calls the factorial function with n-1 and multiplies it with n
  ;; 4. This continues until n is equal to 0

;; Calls the factorial function with the argument 5 and stores the result in "result"
