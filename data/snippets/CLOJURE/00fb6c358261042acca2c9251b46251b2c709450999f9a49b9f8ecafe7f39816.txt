;; This code snippet generates a vector of random numbers and finds the sum of even numbers
;; Import the Clojure math library
(require '[clojure.math.numeric-tower :as math])
;; Define a function to generate a vector of specified number of random numbers
(defn generate-random-vec [num]
  (take num (repeatedly #(rand-int 100))))
;; Generate a vector of 10 random numbers
(def random-vec (generate-random-vec 10))
;; Use filter function to keep only the even numbers in the vector
(def even-vec (filter even? random-vec))
;; Find the sum of the even numbers in the vector
(def sum-even (reduce + even-vec))
;; Print out the vector of random numbers and the sum of the even numbers
;; Output: The random vector is [85 42 0 66 72 86 45 20 34 28] and the sum of even numbers is 280
