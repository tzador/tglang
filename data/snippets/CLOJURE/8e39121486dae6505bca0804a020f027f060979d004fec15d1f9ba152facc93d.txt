;; A recursive function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers

(defn sum-numbers [numbers]
  (if (empty? numbers)  ; recursive base case
    0
    (+ (first numbers) (sum-numbers (next numbers)))))  ; recursive call

;; Usage example:
(sum-numbers [1 2 3 4])  ; should return 10 as the sum of the given list of numbers
