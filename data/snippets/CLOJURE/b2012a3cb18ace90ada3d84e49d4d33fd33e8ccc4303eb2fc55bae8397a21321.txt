;; Define a function that takes in two parameters: a list of numbers and a target number 
;; and returns a new list that contains all the numbers in the original list that are divisible by the target number.

(defn divisible-list [num-list target]
  (filter #(= (mod % target) 0) num-list))

This function definition uses the defn keyword to define a function called "divisible-list". It takes in two parameters, num-list and target. The filter function is used to return a new list, keeping only the numbers from the num-list that are divisible by the target number. The #(= (mod % target) 0) is an anonymous function that checks if the current element is divisible by the target number (represented by the % symbol). If the remainder of the division is 0, the element is kept in the new list. This function does not have any side effects and returns a new list as its output.
