(defn calculate-distance [x1 y1 x2 y2] ; Defines a function called calculate-distance which takes in four parameters: x1, y1, x2, y2
  (let [delta-x (Math/abs (- x1 x2)) ; Declares a local variable delta-x, which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between x1 and x2
        delta-y (Math/abs (- y1 y2)) ; Declares a local variable delta-y, which is equal to the absolute value of the difference between y1 and y2
        x-squared (Math/expt delta-x 2) ; Declares a local variable x-squared, which is equal to delta-x squared
        y-squared (Math/expt delta-y 2) ; Declares a local variable y-squared, which is equal to delta-y squared
        sum-squared (+ x-squared y-squared) ; Declares a local variable sum-squared, which is equal to the sum of x-squared and y-squared
        distance (Math/sqrt sum-squared)] ; Declares a local variable distance, which is equal to the square root of sum-squared
    distance)) ; Returns the value of distance as the output of the function
