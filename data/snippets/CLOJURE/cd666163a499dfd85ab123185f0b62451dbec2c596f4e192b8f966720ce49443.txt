;; Define a function named "recursive-factorial" that takes in one parameter "n"
(defn recursive-factorial [n]
  ;; Use the "if" function to define the base case where n equals 0
  (if (= n 0)
    ;; If n equals 0, return 1 (base case for factorial function)
    1
    ;; If n does not equal 0, use recursion to calculate the factorial
    (* n (recursive-factorial (dec n)))))
    
;; Call the "recursive-factorial" function with a value of 5 and store the result in a variable "factorial"
(def factorial (recursive-factorial 5))

;; Print the result of the factorial calculation
(print factorial)

;; Output: 120
