;; Function to recursively calculate the factorial of a number
(defn factorial [n] ;; Defines a function named 'factorial' that takes in one parameter, 'n'
  (if (= n 1) ;; If n is equal to 1,
    1 ;; Return 1
    (* n (factorial (dec n))) ;; Otherwise, multiply n by the result of calling 'factorial' with n-1 as the parameter
  )
)

;; Check that the factorial function works correctly
(println (factorial 5)) ;; Should print 120, the factorial of 5
(println (factorial 6)) ;; Should print 720, the factorial of 6
(println (factorial 10)) ;; Should print 3628800, the factorial of 10
