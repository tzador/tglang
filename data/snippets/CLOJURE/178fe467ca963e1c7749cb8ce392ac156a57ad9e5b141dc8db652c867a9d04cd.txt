(defn factorial [n]     ; Defines a function called "factorial" that takes in one argument called "n"
  (if (= n 1)           ; Checks if "n" is equal to 1
    1                    ; If it is, returns 1 as the base case for our factorial function
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))  ; If not, multiplies "n" by the result of calling factorial on the argument "n-1" and returns the result

(println (factorial 5))  ; Prints the result of calling factorial on the number 5, which will be 120 (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120)
