;; Define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
(defn factorial [n]
  (cond
    (<= n 1) 1 ;; If n is less than or equal to 1, return 1
    :else (* n (factorial (dec n))) ;; Otherwise, multiply n by the factorial of n-1
  )
)

;; Function call with 5 as argument
(factorial 5)

;; Output: 120 (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1)
