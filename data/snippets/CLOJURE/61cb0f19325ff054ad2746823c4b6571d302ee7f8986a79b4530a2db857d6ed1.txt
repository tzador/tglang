(defn fibonacci 
  "Calculates the nth term in the fibonacci sequence." 
  [n]

    (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2))))) 

(comment "This function uses recursion to calculate the fibonacci sequence for a given number n. First, it checks if n is 1 or 0, in which case it returns n itself. If n is greater than 1, it uses recursion to calculate the previous two terms in the sequence and adds them together to get the nth term. This method is not the most efficient but it is simple and easy to understand.") 

(defn sum 
  "Calculates the sum of numbers in a list." 
  [numbers] 
  (loop [sum 0 numbers numbers] ; using `loop` and `recur` instead of `reduce` for better performance 
    (if (empty? numbers) 
      sum 
      (recur (+ sum (first numbers)) (rest numbers))))) 

(comment "This function uses a `loop` to add the numbers in a list, starting with an initial sum of 0. The `empty?` function is used to check if the list is empty, and if it is, the current sum is returned. Otherwise, the `recur` function is used to keep adding the first number in the list to the current sum and then moving on to the next number in the list until the list is empty.") 

(defn factorial 
  "Calculates the factorial of a given number." 
  [n] 
  (cond 
    (<= n 1) 1 
    :else (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) 

(comment "This function uses recursion and the `cond` statement to calculate the factorial of a given number. First, it checks if n is 1 or 0, in which case it returns 1. If n is greater than 1, it multiplies n with the factorial of n-1 using recursion. This ensures that all numbers from 1 to n are multiplied together to get the factorial.") 

(defmacro curry 
  "Curries a function with n arguments." 
  [f & args] 
  (fn [& remaining-args] 
    (apply f (concat args remaining-args)))) 

(comment "This macro takes in a function and a list of arguments, then returns a function that takes in the remaining arguments and applies the original function with the concatenated list of arguments. This is useful for partial application of functions, where some arguments are fixed and the remaining arguments can be passed in later.") 

(defn multiple-bind 
  "Binds multiple let statements together." 
  [& let-bindings] 
  (loop [bindings let-bindings result []] 
    (if (empty? bindings) 
      result 
      (recur (rest bindings) (conj result `(let ~(first bindings) ~(second bindings)))))) 

(comment "This function takes in multiple `let` bindings as arguments and returns them as a single let statement. It uses `loop` and `recur` to iterate over the bindings and add them to a list, which is ultimately returned as a let statement with all the bindings together.") 

(defn map-iter 
  "Maps a function over a collection using iteration." 
  [f coll] 
  (loop [result [] remaining-coll coll] 
    (if (empty? remaining-coll) 
      (reverse result) 
      (recur (conj result (f (first remaining-coll))) (rest remaining-coll))))) 

(comment "This function uses `loop` and `recur` to iterate over a collection and apply a function to each element, building up a list of results. Once the entire collection has been iterated over, the result list is reversed and returned. This method is not as efficient as using the `map` function, but it serves as an example of using `loop` in Clojure.") 

(defn remove-nils 
  "Removes nil values from a collection." 
  [coll] 
  (loop [result [] remaining-coll coll] 
    (if (empty? remaining-coll) 
      (reverse result) 
      (recur (if (nil? (first remaining-coll)) result (conj result (first remaining-coll))) 
             (rest remaining-coll))))) 

(comment "This function uses `loop` and `recur` to iterate over a collection and remove any nil values from it. It first checks if the first element in the collection is nil, and if it is, it does not add it to the result list. Otherwise, it adds the element to the result list and continues iterating until the collection is empty. The final result list is reversed and returned.")
