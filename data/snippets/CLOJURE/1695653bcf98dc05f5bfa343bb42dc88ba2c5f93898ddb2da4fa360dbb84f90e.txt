;; This code snippet creates a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
(defn factorial [n]                       ;; define function "factorial" with argument "n"
  (if (= n 0)                             ;; check if "n" is equal to 0
    1                                     ;; if true, return 1 (base case for factorial)
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))           ;; if false, multiply "n" with factorial of "n-1" and return the result

(print (factorial 5))                     ;; call the function with argument 5 and print the result
;; Output: 120                            ;; factorial of 5 is 120 (5*4*3*2*1=120)
