(defn random-character [str]
  (let [index (rand-int (count str))]

;; This function takes in a string and randomly selects a character from it
;; using Clojure's `rand-int` function to generate a random index
;; and `substring` function to get the character at that index
;; It then returns a string with just that selected character
