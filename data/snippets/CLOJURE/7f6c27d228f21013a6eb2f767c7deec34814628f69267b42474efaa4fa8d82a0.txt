;; This function takes in a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all elements in the list
(defn sum [lst] 
  (if (empty? lst) 0    ;; Base case: if list is empty, return 0
      (+ (first lst) (sum (rest lst)))))   ;; Recursively calls sum on the rest of the list and adds it to the first element
	  
;; Example call: (sum [1 2 3 4 5])    ;; Expected output: 15
