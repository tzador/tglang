;; Define a function that takes in a list and returns a new list with the same elements in reverse order
(defn reverse-list [list]
  ;; Define an empty list to store the reversed elements
  (def reversed-list '())
  ;; Loop through the input list starting from the end
  (dotimes [i (count list)]
    ;; Add the element at index i to the beginning of the reversed list
    (def reversed-list (conj reversed-list (nth list (- (count list) i 1))))
  )
  ;; Return the reversed list
  reversed-list
)

;; Test the function
(reverse-list '(1 2 3 4 5))
;; Output: (5 4 3 2 1)
