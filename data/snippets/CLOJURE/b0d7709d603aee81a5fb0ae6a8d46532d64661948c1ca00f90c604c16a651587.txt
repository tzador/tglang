(defn factorial
  "Calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion"
  [n]
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

;; Adding annotation to the function
;; Takes in an integer and returns an integer
;; Note: Clojure can handle very large integers, so this function can calculate the factorial of large numbers
;; Usage:
;; (factorial 5)
