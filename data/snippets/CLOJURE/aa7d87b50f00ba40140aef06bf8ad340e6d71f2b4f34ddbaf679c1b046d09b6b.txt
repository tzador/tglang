;;Define a function that takes in two numbers and returns the sum of their square roots
(defn calc-sqrt-sum [num1 num2]
  "Calculates the square root sum of two numbers"
  (+ (Math/sqrt num1) (Math/sqrt num2))
)

;;Create a vector of numbers
(def numbers [25 36 49 64 81])

;;Use higher-order functions to map the calc-sqrt-sum function onto the vector
(map calc-sqrt-sum numbers)
