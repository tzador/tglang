;; A function the calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
(defn factorial
  [n]
  (if (<= n 1)  // base case, return 1 if n is less than or equal to 1 
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) // recursive case, multiply n by factorial(n-1)

(factorial 5) // returns 120 as factorial of 5 is 120
