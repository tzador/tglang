(defn factorial [n] ; define a function named factorial that takes in a parameter n
  (if (= n 0) ; if n equals 0
    1 ; return 1
    (* n (factorial (dec n))))) ; otherwise, multiply n by factorial of n - 1
(factorial 5) ; call the factorial function with argument 5
; => 120 ; the expected output is 120, which is 5 factorial (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
