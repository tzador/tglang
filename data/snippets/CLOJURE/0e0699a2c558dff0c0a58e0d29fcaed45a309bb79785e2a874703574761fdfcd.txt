;; A function that checks if a given number is prime
(defn is-prime?
  ;; Takes in a number and checks if it is greater than 1
  [num] (if (> num 1)
    ;; Checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of itself
    (every? #(not= 0 (rem num %)) (range 2 (Math/sqrt num)))
    ;; Returns false if the number is 1 or any negative number 
    false))

;; A function that takes in an integer and returns a list of prime numbers up to that integer
(defn generate-prime-list
  ;; Takes in an integer and creates a range from 2 to the given integer
  [n] (range 2 (inc n))
  ;; Filters the range to only include prime numbers by using the is-prime? function
  (filter is-prime? (range 2 (inc n))))

;; Example usage:
(generate-prime-list 10) ;;; Returns (2 3 5 7)
(generate-prime-list 20) ;;; Returns (2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19)
