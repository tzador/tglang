This Clojure function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. It takes in a parameter n and checks if it is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns 1. If not, it multiplies n with the result of calling the factorial function with n-1 as the parameter. This process continues until n reaches 1, at which point the final value is returned. This code snippet demonstrates the use of recursion and conditional statements in Clojure.
