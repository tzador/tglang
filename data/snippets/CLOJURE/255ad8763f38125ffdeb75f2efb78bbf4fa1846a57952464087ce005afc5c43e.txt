(defn factorial
  "Calculates the factorial of n.
  n - Integer"
  [n]
  (if (zero? n) 1
    (* n (factorial (dec n)))))
  ; This function recursively calculates the factorial of n.
  ; If n is equal to 0, the factorial is equal to 1.
  ; If n is non-zero, it multiplies n by the factorial of (n-1) until n = 0.
