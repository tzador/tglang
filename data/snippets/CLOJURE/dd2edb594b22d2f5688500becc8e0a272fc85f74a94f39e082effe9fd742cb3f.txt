(defn fibonacci [n] ; define a function named "fibonacci" that takes in one parameter n
  (loop [a 0 b 1 count 0] ; create a loop with 3 variables: a = 0, b = 1, count = 0
    (if (>= count n) ; if count is greater than or equal to n
      b ; return b
      (recur b (+ a b) (inc count))))) ; recursively call the loop function with new values: a = b, b = a + b, count = count + 1
; this function calculates the nth fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence
; example: (fibonacci 6) would return 8, since the 6th number in the fibonacci sequence is 8 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
