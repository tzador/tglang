;;defining a function with two parameters, a and b
(defn add-two-numbers [a b]
  (println "Adding two numbers...")
  (+ a b))

;;defining a map
(def my-map {:key1 "value1",
             :key2 "value2",
             :key3 "value3"})

;;defining a vector
(def my-vector [1 2 3 4 5])

;;a recursive function that computes the factorial of a number
(defn factorial [n]
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

;;a function that filters a collection based on a predicate
(defn my-filter [coll pred]
  (if (empty? coll)
    coll
    (if (pred (first coll))
      (cons (first coll) (my-filter (rest coll) pred))
      (my-filter (rest coll) pred))))

;;calling the add-two-numbers function with arguments 3 and 5
(add-two-numbers 3 5)

;;output: Adding two numbers...
;;        8

;;calling the factorial function with argument 5
(factorial 5)

;;output: 120

;;filtering my-vector to only contain even numbers
(my-filter my-vector even?)

;;output: [2 4]
