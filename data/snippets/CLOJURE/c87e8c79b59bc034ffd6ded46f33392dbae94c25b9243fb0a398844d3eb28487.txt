;; Defines a new Clojure namespace for the GildedTalisman class with :gen-class macro used to create a Java class
;; using reflection. The class will have five methods that accept specific parameters and return specific types.

(defn identify
  [name]
  (str "This gilded talisman is named " name))

;; Defines a function named "identify" that takes in a string parameter "name" and returns a string describing the talisman.

(defn enchant
  [materials]
  (if (some? materials)
    true
    false))

;; Defines a function named "enchant" that takes in a list parameter "materials" and returns a boolean value based on whether the list is not empty.

(defn purify
  [properties]
  (when (contains? properties :corrupted)
    (update properties :corrupted nil)))

;; Defines a function named "purify" that takes in a map parameter "properties" and uses the "when" macro to check if the map contains the key :corrupted.
;; If it does, it uses the "update" function to remove the :corrupted key and its associated value from the map.

(defn combine
  [talisman1 talisman2]
  (into talisman1 talisman2))

;; Defines a function named "combine" that takes in two map parameters "talisman1" and "talisman2" and uses the "into" function to combine them into a single map.

(defn shatter
  [gems]
  (let [total (count gems)]
    (if (> total 0)
      (- total 1)
      0)))

;; Defines a function named "shatter" that takes in a set parameter "gems" and uses the "let" binding form to create a variable "total" that holds the number of elements in the set.
;; The function then uses the "if" macro to check if the total is greater than 0, and if it is, it subtracts 1 from the total and returns it. Otherwise, it returns 0.
