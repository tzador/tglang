(comment
 "This is a function named 'factor' that takes in a parameter 'n' and recursively calculates the factorial value of 'n'.
 It first checks if 'n' is less than or equal to 0, if so, return 1 (this is the base case of the recursive function).
 If 'n' is greater than 0, it multiplies 'n' with the result of calling the function again with 'n' decremented by 1.
 This recursive process continues until the base case is reached, resulting in the factorial value of 'n' being returned.
 The commented section above is just for explanation purposes and is not part of the actual code.")
