;; This code snippet defines a function that takes in a vector of numbers and returns a new vector
;; containing only the even numbers, sorted in ascending order.

(defn filter-even [vector]
  (sort (filter even? vector)))

(assert (= [2 4 6] (filter-even [1 2 3 4 5 6]))) ;; this line is an assertion to check if the function works correctly
