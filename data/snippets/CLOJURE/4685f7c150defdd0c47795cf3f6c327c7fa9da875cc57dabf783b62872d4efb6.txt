;; Define a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all positive numbers in the list
 
(defn sum-positive [numbers]
  (reduce + (filter pos? numbers)))
  ; `defn` is used to define a function with `sum-positive` as its name 
  ; `[numbers]` is the input parameter
  ; `(reduce + (filter pos? numbers))` uses the `reduce` function to add all the positive numbers in the `numbers` list, which is filtered by the `filter` function to only include positive numbers
  ; `pos?` is a predicate function that checks if a number is positive
  ; `+` is an operator that is used to perform addition
 
;; Example input and output:
(sum-positive [1 -5 10 2])
