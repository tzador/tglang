;; This is a function that calculates the factorial of a number
(defn factorial [n] ; define a function called 'factorial' with the argument 'n'
  (if (zero? n) ; if 'n' is equal to zero
    1 ; return 1 (base case)
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; otherwise, multiply 'n' with the factorial of 'n-1' (recursive call)
