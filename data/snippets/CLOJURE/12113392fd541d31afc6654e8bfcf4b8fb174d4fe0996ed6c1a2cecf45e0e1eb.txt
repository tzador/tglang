(defn double [x] (* x 2)) ; Defines a function that takes in one argument and multiplies it by 2

(defn square [x] (* x x)) ; Defines a function that takes in one argument and squares it

(defn triple [x] (* x 3)) ; Defines a function that takes in one argument and multiplies it by 3

(defn add [x y] (+ x y)) ; Defines a function that takes in two arguments and adds them together

(defn subtract [x y] (- x y)) ; Defines a function that takes in two arguments and subtracts the second argument from the first

(defn multiply [x y] (* x y)) ; Defines a function that takes in two arguments and multiplies them together

(defn divide [x y] (/ x y)) ; Defines a function that takes in two arguments and divides the first argument by the second

(defn factorial [n] ; Defines a function that calculates the factorial of a given number
  (if (<= n 1) ; Checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, if so, returns 1
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ; Otherwise, multiplies n by the factorial of n-1 and recursively calls the function until n becomes 1
