`(defn factorial
   "Calculates the factorial of given integer"
   [n]
   (if (<= n 1) 1
       (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))`

This function, `factorial`, takes in an integer `n` and calculates its factorial. It does this recursively by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns 1 as the base case. Otherwise, it multiplies `n` with the result of calling `factorial` on `n` minus 1, effectively calculating the factorial of all the numbers leading up to `n`. This function is pure, as it does not have any side effects, making it easy to test and use in any context. To use this function, simply call `(factorial n)`, where `n` is the integer you want to calculate the factorial of.
