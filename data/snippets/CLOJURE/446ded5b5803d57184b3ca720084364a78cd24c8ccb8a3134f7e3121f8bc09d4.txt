(defn calculate-factorial [n] 
  "Calculates the factorial of a given number n"

  (if (<= n 1) ; checks if n is 1 or less
    1           ; if true, return 1 as the factorial of 0 and 1 is always 1
    (* n (calculate-factorial (- n 1))) ; if false, calls itself recursively to calculate factorial of n
                                        ; by multiplying n with factorial of (n-1)

; Example call to calculate-factorial function
(calculate-factorial 5) ; returns 120 as the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
