;;; This is a function that takes in two numbers and returns their product

(defn multiply [a b]
   "Multiplies two numbers and returns the product"
   (* a b))

;;; This is a higher-order function that takes in a function and applies it to a list of numbers

(defn math-apply [func num-list]
   "Applies a function to a list of numbers and returns the resulting list"
   (map func num-list))

;;; Examples of using the math-apply function

;; Square each number in a list
(math-apply #(Math/pow % 2) [1 2 3 4])

;; Output: (1 4 9 16)

;; Take the square root of each number in a list
(math-apply #(Math/sqrt %) [4 9 16 25])

;; Output: (2 3 4 5)
