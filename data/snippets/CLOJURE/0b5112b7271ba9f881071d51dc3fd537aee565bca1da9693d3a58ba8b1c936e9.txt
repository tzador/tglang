; This function uses recursion and conditional statements to calculate the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence.
; It checks if n is equal to 0, 1, or 2 and returns the corresponding value of 0, 1, or 1.
; If n is greater than 2, it recursively calls the fibonacci function with n-1 and n-2 as parameters and adds the results.
