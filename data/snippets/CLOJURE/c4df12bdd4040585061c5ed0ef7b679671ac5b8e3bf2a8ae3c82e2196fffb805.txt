  ; The above code snippet defines a function 'fibonacci'
  ; that takes in an argument 'n' and calculates the
  ; nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. 
  ; It checks if 'n' is less than or equal to 2 and returns
  ; 1 if it is, otherwise it recursively calculates the nth
  ; number by summing the previous two numbers in the sequence.
  ; This code snippet can be used for various mathematical
  ; and programming challenges involving the Fibonacci sequence.
