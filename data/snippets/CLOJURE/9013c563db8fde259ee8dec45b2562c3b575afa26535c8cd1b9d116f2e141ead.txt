; The above function uses tail recursion to efficiently calculate the sum of the elements in the given array.
; It continuously updates the sum variable and decreases the index by 1 until it reaches 0.
; This ensures that as soon as we have the final sum, the function exits instead of creating a stack of recursive calls.
; Additionally, the function also makes use of bindings and local variables, making it more efficient and concise.
