;; Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
(defn factorial [n]
  ;; Base case: if n is 0, return 1
  (if (= n 0)
    1
    ;; Recursive step: calculate factorial of n-1 and multiply it by n
    (* (factorial (dec n)) n)))

;; Create a variable for the input number
(let [input 5]
  ;; Call the factorial function on the input number and print the result
  (print "The factorial of " input " is " (factorial input)))

;; Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
