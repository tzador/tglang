"Function that takes a number and a list as parameters, and returns a list of lists where the first sublist contains the first 'n' elements from the original list, the second sublist contains the next 'n' elements, and so on. If the number of elements in the original list is not evenly divisible by 'n', the last sublist will contain the remaining elements. "
