;; The above function uses recursion to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
;; It starts by checking if n is equal to 1, if so, it returns 1.
;; Then, it checks if n is equal to 0, if so, it returns 0.
;; If neither condition is met, it recursively calls the function with an input of (n-1) and (n-2),
;; adding them together to get the nth number in the sequence.
