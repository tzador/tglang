  "Evaluates exprs one at a time, from left to right.
  If a form returns a logical true value, 'or' returns
  that value and doesn't evaluate any of the other
  expressions, otherwise it returns the value of the last
  expression. Note that 'or' short-circuits, it does not
  evaluate subsequent expressions if a prior expression
  returns a logical true value."
