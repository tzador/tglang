-- Defines a function that returns the average of a list of numbers
average :: [Double] -> Double

-- Base case if the list is empty
average [] = 0.0

-- Recursive case to calculate the average
average (x:xs) = (x + (average xs * fromIntegral (length xs))) / fromIntegral (length (x:xs))

-- Example input
main = do
    print (average [4.5, 6.2, 3.9, 8.1])

-- Example output
5.675
