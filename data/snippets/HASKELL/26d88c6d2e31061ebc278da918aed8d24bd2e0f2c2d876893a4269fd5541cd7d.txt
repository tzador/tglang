-- This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the maximum value
maximum :: (Ord a) => [a] -> a

-- The empty list has no maximum value
maximum [] = error "Empty list"

-- If there is only one element in the list, it is the maximum value
maximum [x] = x

-- Otherwise, compare the first element to the maximum value of the rest of the list
maximum (x:xs)
  | x > maxTail = x
  | otherwise = maxTail
