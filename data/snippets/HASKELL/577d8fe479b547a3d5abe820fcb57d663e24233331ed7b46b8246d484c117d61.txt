-- Function to calculate the factorial of a number
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n-1)
-- Recursive function to generate a list of factorial numbers
factorialList :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
factorialList [] = []
factorialList (x:xs) = factorial x : factorialList xs
-- Example input and output
factorialList [1,2,3]
-- Output: [1,2,6]
-- Function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList [] = 0
sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs
-- Example input and output
sumList [1,2,3]
-- Output: 6
