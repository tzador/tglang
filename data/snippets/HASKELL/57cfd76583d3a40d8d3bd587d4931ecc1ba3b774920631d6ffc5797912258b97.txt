-- This is a function in Haskell that uses recursion and pattern matching to calculate the factorial of a given number.
-- The function takes in one parameter, which is the number for which the factorial needs to be calculated.
-- The output is the factorial of the given number.

factorial :: Int -> Int  -- Function signature
factorial 0 = 1  -- Base case, factorial of 0 is 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)  -- Recursive case, calculates the factorial by multiplying the number with the factorial of the number minus 1

-- Example usage of the function
factorial 5  -- Output: 120
