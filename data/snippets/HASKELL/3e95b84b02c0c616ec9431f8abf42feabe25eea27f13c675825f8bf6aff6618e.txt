-- This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the maximum value from the list
maximum :: [Int] -> Int

-- Pattern matching on an empty list, return 0 as there is no maximum value
maximum [] = 0

-- Pattern matching on a list with only one element, return that element as the maximum value
maximum [x] = x

-- Recursive case, compare the first element with the maximum value of the rest of the list
maximum (x:xs)
  | x > maxRest = x  -- If x is greater than the maximum value of the rest of the list, it becomes the new maximum
  | otherwise = maxRest  -- Otherwise, the maximum value remains the same
  where
    maxRest = maximum xs  -- Recursively call maximum on the rest of the list
