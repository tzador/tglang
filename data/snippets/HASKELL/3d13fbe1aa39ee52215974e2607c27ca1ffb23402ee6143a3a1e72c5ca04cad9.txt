-- This program calculates the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach
fibonacci :: Int -> Int
fibonacci n = iter 0 1 n
  where
    iter a b n
      | n == 0    = a
      | n == 1    = b

{- Function for calculating the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach.
Each step in the iteration, the previous two numbers are added together to get the current number in the sequence.
If n is 0, the first Fibonacci number is 0.
If n is 1, the second Fibonacci number is 1.
Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with a and b being updated with the new values from the previous iteration, and n being decremented by 1. -}

-- Example output: fibonacci 6 = 8
