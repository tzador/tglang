-- This function computes the sum of the first n natural numbers
sumOfN :: Int -> Int
sumOfN n = sum [1..n]

-- This is a higher-order function that takes in a function and applies it twice
-- to a given input
twice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
twice f x = f (f x)

-- Example usage:
-- `twice sumOfN 5` returns 15, which is the sum of the first 5 natural numbers twice
