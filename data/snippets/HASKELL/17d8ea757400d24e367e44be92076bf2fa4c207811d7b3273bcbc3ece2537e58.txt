-- This is a function that finds the length of a list using recursion
-- Input: List
-- Output: Integer (length of the list)

length :: [a] -> Int
length [] = 0 -- If list is empty, return 0
length (x:xs) = 1 + length xs -- Add 1 to the length and recursively call the function on the rest of the list

-- Example usage
length [1,2,3] -- Output: 3
