-- This code snippet calculates the factorial of a number using recursion
factorial :: Integer -> Integer       -- defining a function factorial that takes an Integer as input and returns an Integer as output
factorial 0 = 1                       -- base case: if number is 0, return factorial as 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)     -- recursive case: multiply number with factorial of (n-1)
