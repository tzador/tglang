-- Define a data type called "Shape" with four constructors: Circle, Rectangle, Square, and Triangle
data Shape = Circle Float    -- Takes in a Float parameter representing the radius
           | Rectangle Float Float    -- Takes in two Float parameters representing the length and width
           | Square Float    -- Takes in a Float parameter representing the side length
           | Triangle Float Float Float    -- Takes in three Float parameters representing the three sides
           
-- Define a function called "area" that takes in a Shape and returns its area as a Float
area :: Shape -> Float
area (Circle r) = pi * (r^2)    -- Uses pi and the radius to calculate the area of a Circle
area (Rectangle l w) = l * w    -- Uses the length and width to calculate the area of a Rectangle
area (Square s) = s^2    -- Uses the side length to calculate the area of a Square
area (Triangle a b c) = let s = (a + b + c) / 2    -- Calculates the semiperimeter of the triangle
                        in sqrt (s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c))    -- Uses the semiperimeter and side lengths to calculate the area of a Triangle
                        
-- Define a function called "perimeter" that takes in a Shape and returns its perimeter as a Float
perimeter :: Shape -> Float
perimeter (Circle r) = 2 * pi * r    -- Uses pi and the radius to calculate the perimeter of a Circle
perimeter (Rectangle l w) = 2 * (l + w)    -- Uses the length and width to calculate the perimeter of a Rectangle
perimeter (Square s) = 4 * s    -- Uses the side length to calculate the perimeter of a Square
perimeter (Triangle a b c) = a + b + c    -- Calculates the perimeter of a Triangle by adding the three sides together
