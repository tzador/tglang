-- The function takes in a list of integers and returns a list of their squares
squareList :: [Int] -> [Int]
squareList xs = [x * x | x <- xs]

-- Sample input list
inputList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

-- Call to the function with input list
outputList = squareList inputList

-- Print the output list
print outputList
