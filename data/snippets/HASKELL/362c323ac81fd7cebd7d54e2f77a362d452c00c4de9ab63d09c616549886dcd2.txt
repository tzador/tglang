-- | This function computes the length of a list using pattern matching and recursion
-- | Example usage: length [1,2,3] returns 3
length :: [a] -> Int
length [] = 0         -- If the list is empty, the length is 0
length (x:xs) = 1 + length xs   -- Otherwise, the length is 1 plus the length of the remaining list
