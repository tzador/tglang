-- This code snippet calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list using recursion
-- Annotated version
sumEven :: [Int] -> Int  -- Function definition: takes in a list of integers and returns an integer
sumEven [] = 0  -- Base case: empty list has a sum of 0
sumEven (x:xs) =  -- Recursive case: split the list into head (x) and tail (xs)
    if even x then  -- Checks if the head is even
        x + sumEven xs  -- Adds the head to the sum of the remaining list
    else
        sumEven xs  -- If head is not even, skip it and continue with the rest of the list
