-- This is a function that takes in two lists and adds their elements together
addLists :: [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int]
addLists [] [] = []  -- Base case: If both lists are empty, return an empty list

-- Recursive case: Add the first elements of each list and use recursion to add the rest
addLists (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x + y) : addLists xs ys

-- Example: addLists [1,2,3] [4,5,6] outputs [5,7,9]
