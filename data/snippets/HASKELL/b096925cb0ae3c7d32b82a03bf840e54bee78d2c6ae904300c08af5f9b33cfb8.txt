-- | This function computes the maximum sum of consecutive elements in a list
maxSumConsec :: [Int] -> Int
-- and returns an Int
maxSumConsec [] = 0
maxSumConsec (x:xs) = max (x + maxSumConsec xs) (maxSumConsec xs)
-- by recursively calculating the maximum sum between a single element at the beginning and the sum of the rest of the list
-- and the maximum sum calculated for the rest of the list itself
