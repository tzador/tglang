-- | Defines a function to calculate the mean of a list of numbers
mean :: [Double] -> Double

-- | Pattern matching to handle empty list
mean [] = error "List is empty!"

-- | Call to built-in function 'sum' to calculate sum of list elements
-- | Call to 'length' to get length of list
-- | Divide sum by length to get the mean
mean xs = sum xs / fromIntegral (length xs)
