-- This function creates a list of numbers, starting from the given value and incrementing by one for a specified number of times
createList :: Int -> Int -> [Int]
createList start n = [start..start+n-1]
-- This function calculates the sum of a list of numbers
listSum :: [Int] -> Int
-- Base case: when the list is empty, return 0
listSum [] = 0
-- Recursive case: add the first element of the list to the sum of the rest of the list
listSum (x:xs) = x + listSum xs
-- This line creates a list of numbers from 1 to 5
myList = createList 1 5
-- This line calculates the sum of the list created above
mySum = listSum myList
-- Printing the final result
print ("The sum of the list is: " ++ show mySum)
