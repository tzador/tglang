-- A function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list
sumEven :: [Int] -> Int -- Function signature
sumEven [] = 0 -- Base case for an empty list, the sum is 0
sumEven (x:xs) -- Recursive case for a non-empty list
  | x `mod` 2 == 0 = x + sumEven xs -- If x is even, add it to the sum of the rest of the list
  | otherwise = sumEven xs -- If x is odd, skip it and continue with the rest of the list
