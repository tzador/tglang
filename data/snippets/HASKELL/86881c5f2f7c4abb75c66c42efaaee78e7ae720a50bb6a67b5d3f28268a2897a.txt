-- Function to calculate the average of a list of numbers
average :: [Double] -> Double
average xs = sum xs / fromIntegral (length xs)

-- Function to filter out numbers below the average in a list
filterBelowAvg :: [Double] -> [Double]
filterBelowAvg xs = filter (\x -> x > average xs) xs

-- Example usage of filterBelowAvg function
exampleList = [1.2, 2.5, 6.7, 3.9, 8.1]
filteredList = filterBelowAvg exampleList

-- Output: [6.7, 8.1]
