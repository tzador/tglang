-- A recursive function in Haskell to calculate the factorial of a given number
-- Takes in an integer n as input and returns an integer as output 
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial n
    -- Base case: if n is 0, return 1
    | n == 0 = 1
    -- Recursive case: multiply n with the factorial of n-1
    | otherwise = n * factorial (n-1)

-- Example usage
main = do
    putStrLn "Enter a number:"
    -- Get input from the user and convert it from String to Int
    input <- getLine
    let num = read input :: Int
    -- Calculate the factorial of the input number and print it
    let result = factorial num
    putStrLn ("The factorial of " ++ show num ++ " is " ++ show result)

-- Output for input = 6
The factorial of 6 is 720
