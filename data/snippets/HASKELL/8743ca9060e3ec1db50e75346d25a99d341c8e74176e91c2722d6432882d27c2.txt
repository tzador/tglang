-- Function to calculate the value of the Fibonacci sequence at the nth index
-- Takes an Integer as input and gives the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence as output
fibonacci :: Int -> Integer
fibonacci n = fibArray !! n
    where 
        fibArray :: [Integer]
        fibArray = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibArray (tail fibArray)
