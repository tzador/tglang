-- | The following code creates a function called 'factorial' that calculates the factorial of a given integer
factorial :: Int -> Int
-- | The base case: when n is 0, the factorial is 1
factorial 0 = 1
-- | The recursive case: when n is a positive integer, the factorial is n multiplied by the factorial of n-1
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)
