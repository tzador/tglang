-- This is a function that takes in a list and returns a new list with only even numbers
-- Input: List of integers

filterEven :: [Int] -> [Int]  -- Function definition taking in a list of integers and returning a list of integers
filterEven [] = []  -- Base case for empty list, returns empty list
filterEven (x:xs)  -- Recursive step, pattern matching to get the head and tail of the list
    | even x = x : filterEven xs  -- If current element is even, prepend it to the filtered list of the rest of the list
    | otherwise = filterEven xs  -- If current element is odd, just continue filtering the rest of the list

-- Example usage:
filterEven [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]  -- Output: [2,4,6,8]
