-- The following snippet creates a function called "findFib" that returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. It uses pattern matching and recursion.

findFib :: Int -> Int
findFib 0 = 0
findFib 1 = 1
findFib n = findFib(n-1) + findFib(n-2) -- Recursively calls the function to add the previous two numbers in the sequence

-- Usage: findFib 5
-- Output: 5
