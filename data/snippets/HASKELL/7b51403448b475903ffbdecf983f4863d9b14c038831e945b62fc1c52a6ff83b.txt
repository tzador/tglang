-- A function that takes in a list of integers and returns a list of their factorial values
factorialList :: [Int] -> [Int]
factorialList [] = [] -- base case, empty list returns empty list
factorialList (x:xs) = factorial x : factorialList xs -- recursive call to break down list
    where factorial n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n-1) -- calculates factorial

-- Example
factorialList [1,2,3,4,5] -- output: [1,2,6,24,120]
