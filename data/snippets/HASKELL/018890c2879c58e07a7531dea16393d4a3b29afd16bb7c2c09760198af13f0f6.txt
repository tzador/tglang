-- This is a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns their sum
-- The function uses pattern matching and recursion for efficient computation

sumList :: [Int] -> Int    -- function declaration with type signature
sumList [] = 0              -- base case, empty list returns 0
sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs   -- recursive case, adds first element to the sum of the rest of the list
