-- | A representation of a binary tree where each node contains some data

data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)

-- | Transforms a given tree by applying a function to each of its values
mapTree :: (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b

mapTree f (Node left a right) = Node (mapTree f left) (f a) (mapTree f right)

-- | Creates a tree where each value is tripled
