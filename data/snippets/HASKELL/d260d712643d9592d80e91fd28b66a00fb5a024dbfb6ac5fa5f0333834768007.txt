-- Define a data type for a binary tree
data Tree a = EmptyTree | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show, Eq)

-- Function to insert a new element into a binary tree
insert :: (Ord a) => a -> Tree a -> Tree a
insert x EmptyTree = Node x EmptyTree EmptyTree
insert x (Node a left right)
    | x == a = Node x left right
    | x < a  = Node a (insert x left) right
    | x > a  = Node a left (insert x right)

-- Function to delete an element from a binary tree
delete :: (Ord a) => a -> Tree a -> Tree a
delete x EmptyTree = EmptyTree
delete x (Node a left right)
    | x == a = merge left right
    | x < a  = Node a (delete x left) right
    | x > a  = Node a left (delete x right)

-- Helper function to merge two binary trees
merge :: (Ord a) => Tree a -> Tree a -> Tree a
merge EmptyTree tree = tree
merge tree EmptyTree = tree
merge left right = Node (minimum right) left (delete (minimum right) right)

-- Function to find the minimum element in a binary tree
findMin :: (Ord a) => Tree a -> Maybe a
findMin EmptyTree = Nothing
findMin (Node val EmptyTree _) = Just val
findMin (Node _ left _) = findMin left

-- Function to find the maximum element in a binary tree
findMax :: (Ord a) => Tree a -> Maybe a
findMax EmptyTree = Nothing
findMax (Node val _ EmptyTree) = Just val
findMax (Node _ _ right) = findMax right

-- Example usage of the binary tree functions
let tree = insert 5 (insert 3 (insert 7 EmptyTree))
-- Output: Node 5 (Node 3 EmptyTree EmptyTree) (Node 7 EmptyTree EmptyTree)

let updatedTree = delete 3 tree
-- Output: Node 5 EmptyTree (Node 7 EmptyTree EmptyTree)

findMin updatedTree
-- Output: Just 5

findMax updatedTree
-- Output: Just 7
