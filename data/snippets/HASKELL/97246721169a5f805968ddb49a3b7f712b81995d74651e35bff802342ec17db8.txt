factorial :: Integer -> Integer -- This line defines the function factorial which takes in an Integer and returns an Integer.
factorial n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n-1) -- This is the recursive definition of the factorial function.
 
main :: IO () -- The main function in Haskell. IO () is a type that represents an IO action with no return value.
main = do -- This line starts the do block.
    putStrLn "Enter a number:" -- This line prints the message "Enter a number:".
    input <- getLine -- This line takes in user input and binds it to the variable input.
    let num = read input :: Integer -- This line converts the input from a String to an Integer and binds it to the variable num.
    print ("The factorial of " ++ input ++ " is: " ++ show (factorial num)) -- This line prints out the factorial of the input number.
-- The output would vary depending on the input provided by the user.
