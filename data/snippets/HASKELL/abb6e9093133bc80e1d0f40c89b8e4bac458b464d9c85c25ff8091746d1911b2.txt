-- This function takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list
-- Input: list (Integers)
-- Output: sum of even numbers (Integer)
-- Example: evenSum [1,2,3,4] => 6

-- Define the function name and input parameters
evenSum :: [Integer] -> Integer

-- Base case: when the list is empty, the sum of even numbers is 0
evenSum [] = 0

-- Recursive case: if the first element is even, add it to the rest of the list
-- otherwise, don't add it
evenSum (x:xs)
  | even x = x + evenSum xs
  | otherwise = evenSum xs
