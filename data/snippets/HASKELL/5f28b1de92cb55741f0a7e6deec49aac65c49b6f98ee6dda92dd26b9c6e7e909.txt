-- A function to check if a list contains a given element using recursion
contains :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool  -- Define the function and its type signature
contains _ [] = False                    -- Base case: empty list, element is not found
contains x (y:ys)                        -- Recursive case: if the first element is the same as the given element, return True
    | x == y = True                      
    | otherwise = contains x ys          -- Otherwise, recursively check the rest of the list
