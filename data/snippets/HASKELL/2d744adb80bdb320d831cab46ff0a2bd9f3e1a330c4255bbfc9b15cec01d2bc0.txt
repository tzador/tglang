--Function to calculate the average of a list of numbers
average :: Num a => [a] -> a
average [] = 0
average x = sum x / fromIntegral (length x)

--Function to calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers
stdDev :: Floating a => [a] -> a
stdDev [] = 0
stdId x = sqrt (sum [(xi - mean)^2 | xi <- x]) / fromIntegral (length x)
  where mean = average x
