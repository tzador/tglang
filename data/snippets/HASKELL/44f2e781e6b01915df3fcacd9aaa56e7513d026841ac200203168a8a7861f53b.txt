-- This is a function that takes in a list of strings and returns the count of how many strings in the 
-- list have at least one uppercase letter.
countUpperCase :: [String] -> Int
countUpperCase [] = 0 -- base case: empty list returns 0
countUpperCase (x:xs) -- pattern matching on the head and tail of the list
    | any isUpper x = 1 + countUpperCase xs -- if the current string has at least one uppercase letter, 
                                          -- add 1 and recursively call the function on the rest of the list
    | otherwise = countUpperCase xs -- otherwise, just recursively call the function on the rest of the list
