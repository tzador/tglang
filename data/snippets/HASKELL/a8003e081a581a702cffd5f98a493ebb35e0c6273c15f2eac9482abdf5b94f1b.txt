-- | This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns a list
-- | of the squares of those integers.
-- | It uses pattern matching and a recursive helper function.
squareList :: [Int] -> [Int]
squareList [] = []     -- base case: empty list
squareList (x:xs) = squareHelper x : squareList xs
  where
    squareHelper :: Int -> Int
    squareHelper n = n * n  -- recursive helper function

-- | Example usage:
-- >>> squareList [1,2,3]
-- [1,4,9]
