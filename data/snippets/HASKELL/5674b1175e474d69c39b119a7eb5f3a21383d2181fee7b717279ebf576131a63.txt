-- A simple program that calculates the factorial of a number

-- Define the factorial function
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial x = x * factorial(x-1)

-- Get input from user
main = do
    putStrLn "Enter a number:"
    num <- getLine
    let input = read num :: Integer

-- Calculate and print the factorial
    putStrLn ("Factorial of " ++ show input ++ " is " ++ show(factorial input))
