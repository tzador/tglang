-- This is a complex code snippet in Haskell
-- It creates a list of numbers, then filters out the even numbers,
-- squares them and prints the sum of squared numbers
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] -- creating a list of numbers
let evenNumbers = filter even numbers -- filtering out the even numbers from the list
let squaredNumbers = map (\x -> x * x) evenNumbers -- squaring each number in the evenNumbers list
let sumSquaredNumbers = foldr (+) 0 squaredNumbers -- calculating the sum of squared numbers
print sumSquaredNumbers -- printing the sum of squared numbers
