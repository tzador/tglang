-- This is a sample function in Haskell that calculates the factorial of a given number

factorial :: Integer -> Integer -- Function declaration with type declaration

factorial 0 = 1 -- Base case

factorial n = n * factorial (n-1) -- Recursive case where function calls itself with a smaller input

main = do -- Main function
    putStrLn "Enter a number: "
    n <- readLn -- Takes user input and converts it to Integer
    putStrLn ("The factorial of " ++ show n ++ " is " ++ show (factorial n)) -- Prints the result
