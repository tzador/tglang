-- Given a list of integers, find the maximum value in the list
maximum' :: [Int] -> Int -- Create a function that takes in a list of integers and returns an integer
maximum' [] = error "Empty list" -- If the list is empty, throw an error
maximum' [x] = x -- If the list only has one element, that element is the maximum
maximum' (x:xs) = max x (maximum' xs) -- Otherwise, use recursion to compare the first element to the maximum of the rest of the list
-- max is a built-in function that returns the larger of two values
-- : is the cons operator that adds an element to the front of a list
-- xs is the rest of the list after removing the first element
-- This function works by continuously comparing the current maximum to the next element in the list
-- Once it reaches the end of the list, the maximum value will be returned
