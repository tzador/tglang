-- | This function takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers
sumEven :: [Int] -> Int
sumEven [] = 0 -- base case: empty list, sum is 0
sumEven (x:xs) -- recursive case
    | even x = x + sumEven xs -- if current number is even, add to sum and recurse with remaining list
    | otherwise = sumEven xs -- if current number is odd, ignore it and recurse with remaining list
