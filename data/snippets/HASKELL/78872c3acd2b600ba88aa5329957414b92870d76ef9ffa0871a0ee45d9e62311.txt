-- A function that recursively calculates the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci :: Int -> Int
fibonacci n
  | n == 0 = 0 -- Base case
  | n == 1 = 1 -- Base case
  | otherwise = fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2) -- Recursively calculates the nth Fibonacci number by summing the previous two numbers
