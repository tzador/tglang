-- This function computes the factorial of a given number using pattern matching
-- Input:
--     n - a non-negative integer
-- Output:
--     factorial of n 
factorial :: Int -> Int
-- Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial 0 = 1
-- Recursive case: factorial of n is n times the factorial of (n-1)
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)
