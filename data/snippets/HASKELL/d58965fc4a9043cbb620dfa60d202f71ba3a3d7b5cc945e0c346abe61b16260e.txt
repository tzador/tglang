-- A function that takes in a list and returns a list of the squares of all the positive integers in the list
squareList :: [Int] -> [Int]
-- pattern matching to handle empty lists
squareList [] = []
-- if element is positive, square it and add it to the front of the new list
squareList (x:xs)
  | x > 0 = x^2 : squareList xs
  -- if element is negative or 0, skip it and continue with rest of list
  | otherwise = squareList xs
-- example function call: squareList [1,2,-3,4,0]
-- output: [1,4,16]
