-- | This function takes in a list of integers and returns a list containing
-- | only the elements that are divisible by 3.
divisibleBy3 :: [Int] -> [Int]
divisibleBy3 xs = [x | x <- xs, x `mod` 3 == 0] -- uses list comprehension and modulo operator

-- | The main function that handles input and output
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Enter a list of integers: "
    x <- getLine -- gets user input
    let nums = map read (words x) :: [Int] -- converts input string into list of integers
    let result = divisibleBy3 nums -- calls divisibleBy3 function with input list
    putStr "The elements divisible by 3 are: "
    print result -- prints the result list
