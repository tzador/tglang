-- Function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming

fib :: Int -> Integer  -- function takes in an integer and returns an integer
fib n = 
  let -- create a list to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers
    fibs = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)  -- fibs list contains first two Fibonacci numbers
  in
    fibs !! n  -- return the nth element in the fibs list, which is the nth Fibonacci number
