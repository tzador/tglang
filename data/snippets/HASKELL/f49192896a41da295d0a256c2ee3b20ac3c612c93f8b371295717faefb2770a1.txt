    This is a function that reverses a list using foldl.
    A foldl function takes in a binary function, an initial value, and a list.
    The binary function takes in two parameters and combines them in a certain way.
    In this case, we have a lambda function which takes in two lists and concatenates them in reverse order.
    We then initialize the fold with an empty list as the accumulator and the original list as the input list.
    The `foldl` function then applies the lambda function to the accumulator and the current element of the input list,
    and updates the accumulator with the result.
    Finally, we return the accumulator which now contains the reversed list.
