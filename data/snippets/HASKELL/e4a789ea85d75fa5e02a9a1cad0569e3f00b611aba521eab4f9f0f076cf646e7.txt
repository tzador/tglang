{- This function takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of their squares -}
squareList :: [Int] -> [Int]
squareList [] = [] -- base case, empty list
squareList (x:xs) = (x * x) : squareList xs -- recursive case, add square of first element to list and call function on the rest of the list

squareList [1,2,3,4,5] -- output: [1,4,9,16,25]
