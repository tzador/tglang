-- Function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of squares of even numbers
sumOfSquaresOfEvens :: [Int] -> Int
sumOfSquaresOfEvens xs =
  let evenNums = filter even xs  -- filter out even numbers from the list
      squares = map (^2) evenNums -- square each even number
  in sum squares                  -- sum the squares

-- Example usage:
sumOfSquaresOfEvens [1,2,3,4,5,6] -- Output: 56 (2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 = 4 + 16 + 36 = 56)
