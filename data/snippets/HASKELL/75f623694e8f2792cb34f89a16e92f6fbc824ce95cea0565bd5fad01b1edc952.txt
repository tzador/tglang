-- | The fibonacci function takes an integer 'n' and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
-- | This implementation uses recursion with pattern matching to calculate the sequence.
-- | The base cases are defined for 0 and 1, with the recursive case being the addition of
-- | the previous two numbers in the sequence.
fibonacci :: Int -> Integer
fibonacci 0 = 0
fibonacci 1 = 1
fibonacci n = fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2)
