-- Define a function that calculates the mean of a list of numbers
mean :: [Double] -> Double
mean = sum <*> (/) <$> fromIntegral . length <*> id
-- This function uses the Applicative Functors and Function Composition operators
-- to calculate the mean. First, it uses the function `sum` to calculate the
-- sum of all elements in the list. Then, it uses a partially applied function
-- `(/)` which divides the sum by the length of the list. The second argument
-- of `(/)` is replaced by the length of the list using the `fromIntegral`
-- function which converts the length to a `Double`. Finally, the result is
-- returned using the `id` function which is the identity function. This whole
-- process is equivalent to `(sum / fromIntegral (length))` or `sum / length`
-- in mathematical notation.
