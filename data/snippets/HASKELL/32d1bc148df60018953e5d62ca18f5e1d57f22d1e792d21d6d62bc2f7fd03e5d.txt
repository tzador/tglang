-- | The following function takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.
sumEven :: [Int] -> Int
sumEven list = foldr (+) 0 (filter even list) 
-- | The foldr function takes in a starting value, an operator, and a list. It applies the operator to the starting value and the first element in the list, then applies the operator to the result and the next element in the list, and so on, until the list is exhausted. In this case, the starting value is 0, the operator is addition (+), and the list is the filtered list containing only even numbers.
-- | The filter function takes in a predicate function (in this case, the even function) and a list, and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate (in this case, only even numbers).
