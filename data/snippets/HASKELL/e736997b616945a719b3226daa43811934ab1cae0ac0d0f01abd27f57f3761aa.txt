-- The following code creates a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number
-- Input parameter: n - the number to calculate factorial for
recursiveFactorial :: (Num a, Eq a) => a -> a
recursiveFactorial 0 = 1
recursiveFactorial n = n * recursiveFactorial (n-1)
-- Example usage: recursiveFactorial 5 returns 120 since 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
