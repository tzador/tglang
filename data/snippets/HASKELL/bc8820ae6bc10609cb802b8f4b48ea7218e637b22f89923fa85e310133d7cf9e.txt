-- Define a function that takes in two lists and returns a list of tuples containing all possible combinations of elements from the two lists
-- Example: combineLists [1,2,3] [4,5] should give [(1,4),(1,5),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5)]
combineLists :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
combineLists [] _ = []
combineLists (x:xs) list2 = [(x, y)| y <- list2] ++ combineLists xs list2
