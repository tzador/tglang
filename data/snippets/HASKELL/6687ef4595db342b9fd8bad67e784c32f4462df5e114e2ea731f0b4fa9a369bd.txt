--This function takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of the squares of all the even numbers
--Input: List of integers
--Output: Integer (sum of squares of even numbers)

sumOfEvenSquares :: [Int] -> Int
sumOfEvenSquares [] = 0 --the base case, if the list is empty the sum is 0
sumOfEvenSquares (x:xs)
    | even x = x^2 + sumOfEvenSquares xs --if the current number is even, square it and add it to the sum
    | otherwise = sumOfEvenSquares xs --if the current number is odd, skip it and move on
