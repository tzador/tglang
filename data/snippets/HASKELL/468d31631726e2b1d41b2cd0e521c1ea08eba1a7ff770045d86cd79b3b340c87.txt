  This is a function for finding the square root of a number using Newton's method.
  Input: num :: Double  -- the number whose square root is to be found
         epsilon :: Double  -- the acceptable level of error
         guess :: Double  -- initial estimate of the square root
  Output: Double  -- the square root of the input number

sqrtNewton :: Double -> Double -> Double -> Double
sqrtNewton num epsilon guess
  | abs (guess * guess - num) < epsilon = guess  -- if the error is within the acceptable level, return the guess as the square root
  | otherwise = sqrtNewton num epsilon newGuess -- otherwise, use the new guess to iterate the function again
      where newGuess = (guess + num / guess) / 2  -- new guess is calculated using the Newton's method formula
