-- Function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum using recursion
-- Input: List of numbers
-- Ouput: Sum of the numbers in the list
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList [] = 0                     -- Base case: empty list has sum of 0
sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs    -- Recursively add current number to sum of rest of the list

-- Example: sumList [1,2,3,4] outputs 10
