{-
This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given integer
Takes an Int as input and returns an Int as output
-}
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial n 
    | n == 0 = 1       -- base case, factorial of 0 is 1
    | otherwise = n * factorial (n-1) -- recursive case, multiply n by factorial of n-1

main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Enter a number:"
    num <- getLine     -- takes user input
    let n = read num :: Int -- converts input to Int
    print (factorial n) -- calls the factorial function and prints the result
