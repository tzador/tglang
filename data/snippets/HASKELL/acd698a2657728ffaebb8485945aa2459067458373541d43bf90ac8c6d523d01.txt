-- This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns their sum
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
-- Base case: when the list is empty, return 0
sumList [] = 0
-- Recursive case: add the first element to the sum of the rest of the list
sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs
-- Example call with a list of integers
sumList [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -- Output: 15
