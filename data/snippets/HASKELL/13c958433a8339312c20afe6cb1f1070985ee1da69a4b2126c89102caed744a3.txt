-- This code snippet is a function that recursively computes the factorial of a number
-- It takes in a single argument, the number whose factorial is to be computed
-- It outputs the factorial of the number

    factorial n = if n < 0 then error "Factorial of negative number does not exist" 
                  else if n == 0 || n == 1 then 1 
                  else n * (factorial (n-1))
