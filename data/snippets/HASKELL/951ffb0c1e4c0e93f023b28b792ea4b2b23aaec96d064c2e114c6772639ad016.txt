module Main where

-- Defining a custom data type called 'Student' that takes in two parameters, a name (String) and a list of grades (list of Integers)
data Student = Student String [Integer]

-- Defining a function 'calculateAverage' that takes in a list of grades and returns the average as a float
calculateAverage :: [Integer] -> Float
calculateAverage grades = fromIntegral (sum grades) / fromIntegral (length grades)

-- Creating a list of students using the custom data type with sample data
students :: [Student]
students = [Student "John" [98, 85, 72], Student "Jane" [90, 95, 88], Student "Bob" [75, 87, 92]]

-- Defining a function 'printStudentInfo' that takes in a Student and prints their name and average grade
printStudentInfo :: Student -> IO ()
printStudentInfo (Student name grades) = do
  putStrLn ("Name: " ++ name)
  putStrLn ("Average grade: " ++ show (calculateAverage grades))

-- Using the 'map' function to apply the 'printStudentInfo' function to each student in the list and print their info
main :: IO ()
main = mapM_ printStudentInfo students
