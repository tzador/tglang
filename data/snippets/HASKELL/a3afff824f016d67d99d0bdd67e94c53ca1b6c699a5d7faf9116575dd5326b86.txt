-- This code snippet shows a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
fib :: Integer -> Integer
fib 0 = 0 -- Base case when n = 0
fib 1 = 1 -- Base case when n = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2) -- Recursive case, calculates the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers

-- Example usage: 
-- fib 5 returns 5, since the 5th Fibonacci number is 5
