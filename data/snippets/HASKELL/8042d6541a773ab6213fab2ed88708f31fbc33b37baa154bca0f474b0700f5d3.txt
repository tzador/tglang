-- A program that finds the median of a list of numbers
median :: [Float] -> Float -- function declaration
median xs =
  let sorted = sort xs -- sort the list
      mid = length sorted `div` 2 -- find the middle index
  in if length sorted `mod` 2 == 0 -- even number of elements
       then (sorted !! mid) + (sorted !! (mid - 1)) / 2 -- average the two middle numbers
       else sorted !! mid -- odd number of elements, return middle number
