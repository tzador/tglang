-- Define a function that takes in two lists and returns the product of their lengths

productOfLengths :: [a] -> [b] -> Int
productOfLengths xs ys = product [length xs, length ys]

product :: [Int] -> Int
product [] = 1
product (x:xs) = x * product xs

-- Example usage:
-- productOfLengths [1,2,3] ["a","b","c"] = 9
-- productOfLengths [5,10,15] ["cat","dog"] = 6
