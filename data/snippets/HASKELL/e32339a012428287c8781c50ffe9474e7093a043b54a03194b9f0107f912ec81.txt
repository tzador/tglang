-- This is a function that takes in two lists of integers and returns the intersection of the two lists
-- The intersection of two lists is a list of elements that are present in both lists

-- The function takes in two parameters, both lists of integers
-- The first parameter is named `list1`
-- The second parameter is named `list2`
