-- This function takes in a list of integers and returns a new list consisting of the squares of each element.
-- Input: list of integers
-- Output: list of integers

squareList :: [Int] -> [Int]  -- function declaration with parameter and return type
squareList [] = []             -- base case for when the list is empty
squareList (x:xs) = x^2 : squareList xs  -- recursive case, squares the head element and adds it to the new list, then calls the function again for the remaining elements

-- Example Input: [1,2,3,4]
-- Example Output: [1,4,9,16]
