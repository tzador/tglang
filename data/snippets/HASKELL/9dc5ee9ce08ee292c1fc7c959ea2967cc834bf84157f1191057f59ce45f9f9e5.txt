fibs :: [Int]  -- declares a function called first which takes in no parameters
fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs  -- assigns the first two elements of the list to 0 and 1, and then calls the recursive function "next" on the list
  where
    next (a : b : rest) = (a + b) : next (b : rest)  -- defines the recursive function "next", which takes in a list and returns a new list with the sum of the first two elements of the input list as the head, and the remaining elements of the original list as the tail
