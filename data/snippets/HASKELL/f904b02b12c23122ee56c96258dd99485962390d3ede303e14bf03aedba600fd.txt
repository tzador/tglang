-- This is a function that takes in an integer as a parameter
-- and uses list comprehension to generate a list of tuples, 
-- each containing two integers from 1 to the given parameter.
-- For example, if the parameter is 3, the output list would be [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]
