-- Example of a higher order function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of the squares of all even numbers
sumEvenSquares :: [Int] -> Int
-- Use the map function to apply the square function to each element
-- Use the filter function to only keep the even numbers
-- Use the foldl function to sum up all the squared even numbers
sumEvenSquares = foldl (+) 0 . filter even . map (^2)
