-- output: factorial - the factorial of the input number

factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial n
   | n == 0 || n == 1   = 1                                      -- base case
   | n > 1              = n * factorial (n - 1)                   -- recursive case
   | otherwise          = error "Factorial of negative numbers is not defined!" // handles negative inputs
