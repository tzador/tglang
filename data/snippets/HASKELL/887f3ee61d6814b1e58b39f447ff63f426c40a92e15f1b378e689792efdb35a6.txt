-- This is a simple program in Haskell that calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
-- The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers, starting with 0 and 1

-- Define a helper function to calculate Fibonacci numbers
fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

-- Define main function to take user input and call the helper function
main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn "Enter the value of n:"
  input <- getLine
  let n = (read input :: Int)
  let result = fib n
  putStrLn ("The " ++ show n ++ "th term in the Fibonacci sequence is: " ++ show result)
