-- This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns their sum.
-- INPUT: A list of integers
-- OUTPUT: The sum of all the integers in the list
sumIntegers :: [Int] -> Int
sumIntegers [] = 0 -- Base case: If the list is empty, the sum is 0
sumIntegers (x:xs) = x + sumIntegers xs -- Recursive case: Add the first element of the list to the sum of the rest of the list
