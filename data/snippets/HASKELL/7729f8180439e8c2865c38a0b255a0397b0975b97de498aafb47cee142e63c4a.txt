-- This code snippet creates a function called 'fibonacci' that calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
-- The function uses recursion and pattern matching to efficiently compute the result

-- Define the 'fibonacci' function
-- Takes in an integer 'n' as input
-- Returns an integer representing the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci :: Int -> Int 

-- Base case: when n is equal to 0 or 1, return n
fibonacci 0 = 0
fibonacci 1 = 1

-- Recursive case: when n is greater than 1
fibonacci n = fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2)

-- Example use: calculating the 10th term of the Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci 10 -- Output: 55
