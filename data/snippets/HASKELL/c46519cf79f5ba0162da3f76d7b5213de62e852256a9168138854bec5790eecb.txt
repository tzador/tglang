-- | A function that takes in a list of integers and calculates the sum of all even numbers in the list
-- | Example Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
-- | Output: 6
evenSum :: [Int] -> Int
evenSum [] = 0 -- base case, empty list has sum of 0
evenSum (x:xs) -- recursive case, split list into head and tail
  | even x = x + evenSum xs -- if head is even, add it to the sum of tail
  | otherwise = evenSum xs -- if head is odd, move onto the next element
