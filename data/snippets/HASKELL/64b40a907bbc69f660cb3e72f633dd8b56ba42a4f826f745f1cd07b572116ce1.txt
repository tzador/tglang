-- | This function calculates the factorial of a given integer n
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial n
  | n < 0 = error "Factorial of negative number is undefined"
  | n == 0 = 1
  | n > 0 = n * factorial (n - 1)

-- | This function calculates the binomial coefficient of two given integers n and r
binomialCoefficient :: Int -> Int -> Int
binomialCoefficient n r
  | r < 0 = error "r cannot be negative"
  | r > n = error "r cannot be greater than n"
  | otherwise = factorial n `div` (factorial r * factorial (n - r))
