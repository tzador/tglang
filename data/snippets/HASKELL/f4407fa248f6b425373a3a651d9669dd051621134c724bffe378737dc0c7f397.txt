`Tree` is a data type that can represent either a single value `Leaf x` or a node with two subtrees `Node (Tree a) (Tree a)`. The `instance Functor` declaration allows us to map a function `f` over all the values in a tree, returning a new tree with the mapped values.

In this code snippet, we are creating an `instance` of the `Functor` type class for the `Tree` data type in Haskell. This allows us to use the `fmap` function, which takes a function `f` and a structure `Tree a` and returns a new structure with the function applied to each value in the tree.

The `fmap` function is defined using pattern matching on the different ways a `Tree` can be constructed. If it is just a `Leaf x`, then the function `f` is applied to `x` and wrapped in a new `Leaf`. If it is a `Node l r`, then we recursively apply `fmap` to the left and right subtrees and combine them into a new `Node` with the updated values.

This code snippet showcases the power of Haskell's type system and its ability to abstract over different data types with the use of type classes.
