-- A function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers
-- Input: List of integers
-- Output: Sum of even numbers

sumEven :: [Int] -> Int    -- Function type declaration
sumEven xs = foldl' (+) 0 (filter even xs)    -- Using foldl' to sum all even numbers in the list, where 'even' is a built-in function in Haskell to check if a number is even

-- Example usage:
-- sumEven [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]    -- Output: 6
-- sumEven [5, 10, 15, 20]    -- Output: 30
