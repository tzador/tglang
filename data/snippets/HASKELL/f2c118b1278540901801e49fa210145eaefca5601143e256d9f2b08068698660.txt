-- | Defines a type alias for "Maybe" values with a custom error type
type MaybeError a = Either String (Maybe a)

-- | A function that takes in a MaybeError value and returns another MaybeError value
mapMaybeError :: (a -> b) -> MaybeError a -> MaybeError b

-- | The implementation of the mapMaybeError function
mapMaybeError _ (Left err) = Left err    -- if input is a Left value (error), just return it
mapMaybeError f (Right maybeVal) = Right $ fmap f maybeVal   -- if input is a Right value (Maybe), apply f to the Maybe value and return it as a Right value
