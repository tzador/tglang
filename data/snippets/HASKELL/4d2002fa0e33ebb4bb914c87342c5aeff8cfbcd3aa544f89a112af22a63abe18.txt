-- This is a function in Haskell that uses recursion
-- to calculate the factorial of a given number

factorial :: Integer -> Integer -- defining the function
factorial 0 = 1 -- base case, factorial of 0 is 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1) -- recursive call, multiplies n with factorial of n-1

-- Example usage: factorial 5 = 120
