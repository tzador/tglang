-- This is a complex function that takes in a list of integers and returns a list of tuples, where the first element in each tuple is the original integer, and the second element is a list containing all its factors.
 
 factors :: [Int] -> [(Int, [Int])]
 factors lst = [(x, findFactors x) | x <- lst]

 findFactors :: Int -> [Int]
 findFactors n = [x | x <- [1..n], n `mod` x == 0]
