-- This code snippet calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence, using list comprehension and recursion.

-- defining the function for calculating the Fibonacci sequence
fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

-- defining a list comprehension to generate a list of Fibonacci numbers
fibs :: [Int]
fibs = [fib n | n <- [0..]]

-- function to retrieve the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence from the list
nthTerm :: Int -> Int
nthTerm n = fibs !! n

-- running the function with input n = 10
nthTerm 10
