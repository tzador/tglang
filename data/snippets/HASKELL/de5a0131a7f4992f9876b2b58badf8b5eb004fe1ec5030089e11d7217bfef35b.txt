-- A function that takes in a list of strings and returns a new list with only the strings that start with a vowel
filterVowels :: [String] -> [String]
-- The function uses pattern matching and recursion to filter out the strings starting with a vowel
filterVowels [] = []
filterVowels (x:xs)
    | head x `elem` "aeiouAEIOU" = x : filterVowels xs
    | otherwise = filterVowels xs

-- Example input: ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pear"]
