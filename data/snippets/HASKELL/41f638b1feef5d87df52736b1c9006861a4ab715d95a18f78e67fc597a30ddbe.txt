-- This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all elements in the list

sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList [] = 0 -- Base case: if the list is empty, the sum is 0
sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs -- Recursive step: add the first element to the sum of the rest of the list

-- Example usage:
-- sumList [1,2,3,4] returns 10 
-- sumList [] returns 0
-- sumList [-1,5,2] returns 6
