-- This code snippet is a function in Haskell that calculates the factorial of a number

-- | This is the function signature, it takes in an integer and returns an integer
factorial :: Int -> Int 

-- | This is the base case, where if the input is 0, the output is 1
factorial 0 = 1

-- | This is the recursive case, where the function calls itself with a decreased input
-- | and multiplies it with the current input
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)
