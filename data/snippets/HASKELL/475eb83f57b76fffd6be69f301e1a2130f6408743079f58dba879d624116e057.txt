-- This code snippet is a function that calculates the dot product of two vectors in three-dimensional space.

-- Define a data type for a three-dimensional vector
data Vector a = Vector a a a deriving (Eq, Show)

-- Define a function to calculate the dot product of two vectors
dotProduct :: (Num a) => Vector a -> Vector a -> a
dotProduct (Vector x1 y1 z1) (Vector x2 y2 z2) = x1*x2 + y1*y2 + z1*z2
