-- A function that takes in a list and returns the reverse of that list

reverseList :: [a] -> [a]   -- function signature
reverseList [] = []         -- base case: empty list returns empty list
reverseList (x:xs) = reverseList xs ++ [x]  -- recursive call, adding current element to end of reversed rest of list
