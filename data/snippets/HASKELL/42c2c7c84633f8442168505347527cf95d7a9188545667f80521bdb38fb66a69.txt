-- This code snippet calculates the nth term in the fibonacci sequence

fib :: Int -> Int -- function signature for fibonacci function which takes an integer argument and returns an integer
fib 0 = 0 -- base case for fibonacci sequence
fib 1 = 1 -- base case for fibonacci sequence
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2) -- recursive call to fibonacci function to calculate the nth term

main = do -- main function to take user input and call fibonacci function
    putStrLn "Enter n to calculate the nth term in the fibonacci sequence: " -- print statement to ask for user input
    n <- readLn :: IO Int -- read user input and store it in 'n' variable
    let result = fib n -- call fibonacci function with user input and store result in 'result' variable
    putStrLn ("The nth term in the fibonacci sequence is: " ++ show result) -- print statement to display the result
