module Main where
-- This declaration specifies the module name and indicates that it contains the main function.

main :: IO ()
-- The main function returns an IO action, which represents an effectful computation in Haskell.

main = do
-- The do notation is used to sequence multiple IO actions and create a larger IO action.

    putStrLn "Enter a number: "
    -- This is an IO action that prints a string to the console.

    input <- getLine
   -- This is an IO action that takes user input from the console and binds it to the variable "input".

    let num = (read input :: Int)
   -- This line uses the "let" keyword to create a variable "num" and assigns it the parsed value of "input" as an integer.

    putStrLn ("The number you entered is: " ++ show num)
    -- This IO action prints a string that contains the value of "num" using the "++" (concatenation) operator and the "show" function to convert the integer to a string.

    word <- getLine
