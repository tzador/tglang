-- | Function to sort list using selection sort algorithm
selectionSort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]
selectionSort [] = [] -- Base case, empty list returns empty list
selectionSort xs =
  let smallest = minimum xs -- Find the smallest element in the list
      rest = delete smallest xs -- Remove the smallest element from the list
  in smallest : selectionSort rest -- Add the smallest element to the beginning of the sorted list

-- | Main function
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let unsorted = [5, 2, 7, 1, 8, 4, 3] -- Initial list to be sorted
      sorted = selectionSort unsorted -- Sort the list using selection sort
  putStrLn $ "Unsorted list: " ++ show unsorted -- Print unsorted list
  putStrLn $ "Sorted list: " ++ show sorted -- Print sorted list
