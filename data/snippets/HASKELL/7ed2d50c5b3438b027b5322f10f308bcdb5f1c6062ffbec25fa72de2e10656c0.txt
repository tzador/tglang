-- This code snippet uses recursion and pattern matching to implement a function that calculates
-- the nth Fibonacci number.

fib :: Int -> Int  -- Declare a function named `fib` that takes in an Int and returns an Int
fib 0 = 0          -- Define the base case where n = 0, which returns 0
fib 1 = 1          -- Define the base case where n = 1, which returns 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)  -- Define the recursive case, where we recursively call fib with n-1 and n-2
