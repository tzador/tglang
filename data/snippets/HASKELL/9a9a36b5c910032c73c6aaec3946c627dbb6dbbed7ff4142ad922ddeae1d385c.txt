-- | This is a function that takes in an Int tuple and returns the sum of the two numbers
sumTuple :: (Int, Int) -> Int 
sumTuple (x, y) = x + y 

-- | This is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number 
factorial :: Int -> Int 
factorial 0 = 1 
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1) 

-- | This is a higher-order function that takes in a function and applies it to an Int tuple 
applyFunc :: (Int -> Int) -> (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int) 
applyFunc f (x, y) = (f x, f y)
