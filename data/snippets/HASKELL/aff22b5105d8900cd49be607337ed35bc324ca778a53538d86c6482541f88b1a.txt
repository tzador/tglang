-- Define a function that takes in a list of integers and returns their sum
sum :: [Int] -> Int

-- Using recursion, calculate the sum of the list elements
sum [] = 0
sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs

-- Test the function with a list of numbers
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  putStrLn $ "Sum of " ++ show nums ++ " is " ++ show (sum nums)
  -- Output: Sum of [1,2,3,4,5] is 15
