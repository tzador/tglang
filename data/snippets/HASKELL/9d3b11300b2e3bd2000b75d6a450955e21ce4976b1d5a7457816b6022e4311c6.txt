-- This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers.

sumEven :: [Int] -> Int -- defines the function name and type signature
sumEven [] = 0           -- base case, empty list returns 0
sumEven (x:xs)           -- recursive case with pattern matching
  | even x = x + sumEven xs -- if the number is even, add it to the sum of remaining numbers
  | otherwise = sumEven xs  -- if the number is odd, discard it and continue recursively

-- Example usage:
-- sumEven [1,2,3,4,5,6] returns 12 (2+4+6)
-- sumEven [10,15,20,25] returns 30 (10+20)
