-- This is a function that takes in a list of integers and returns a new list with only the even numbers.
filterEven :: [Int] -> [Int]
filterEven [] = [] -- base case, an empty list returns an empty list
filterEven (x:xs) | even x    = x : filterEven xs -- if current element is even, add it to new list and recursively call function on remaining list
                  | otherwise = filterEven xs -- if not even, skip it and recursively call function on remaining list
