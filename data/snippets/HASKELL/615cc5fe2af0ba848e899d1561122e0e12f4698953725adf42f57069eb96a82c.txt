The following code snippet demonstrates a function that takes in a list of strings,
and returns the first element in the list that starts with the letter 'a'.
It uses pattern matching and recursion to iterate through the list.

getFirstA :: [String] -> String
getFirstA [] = "No strings with the letter 'a' found."
getFirstA (x:xs)
    | head x == 'a' = x
    | otherwise = getFirstA xs
