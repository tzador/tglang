-- This is a code snippet in Haskell that implements a function to calculate the factorial of a number
fact :: Integer -> Integer  -- function declaration
fact 0 = 1  -- base case for factorial of 0
fact n = n * fact (n - 1)  -- recursive function using factorial definition
-- This function can also be written with a guard clause
fact' :: Integer -> Integer
fact' n | n <= 1 = 1                  -- guard clause for base case
        | otherwise = n * fact' (n-1) -- recursive function using factorial definition
