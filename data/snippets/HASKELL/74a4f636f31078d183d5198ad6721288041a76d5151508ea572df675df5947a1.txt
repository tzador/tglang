-- Create a new type called "Color" that can hold three values: Red, Green, and Blue
data Color = Red  | Green | Blue

-- Define a new type called "Shape" that can hold three values: Circle, Square, and Rectangle
data Shape = Circle Float | Square Float | Rectangle Float Float

-- Define a function 'area' that takes a Shape and calculates its area depending on the type of shape
area :: Shape -> Float
area (Circle r) = pi * r * r
area (Square s) = s * s
area (Rectangle l w) = l * w

-- Define a function 'colorCode' that takes a Color and returns its corresponding HTML color code
colorCode :: Color -> String
colorCode Red = "#FF0000"
colorCode Green = "#00FF00"
colorCode Blue = "#0000FF"

-- Define a function 'printInfo' that takes a Shape and a Color and prints information about the shape and its color
printInfo :: Shape -> Color -> String
printInfo shape color = "This " ++ getColor color ++ " " ++ getShape shape ++ " has an area of " ++ show (area shape) ++ " square units."

-- Helper function to get the correct string for the shape
getShape :: Shape -> String
getShape (Circle _) = "circle"
getShape (Square _) = "square"
getShape (Rectangle _ _) = "rectangle"

-- Helper function to get the correct string for the color
getColor :: Color -> String
getColor Red = "red"
getColor Green = "green"
getColor Blue = "blue"

-- Example usage:
-- printInfo (Circle 5) Green
-- Output: "This green circle has an area of 78.53982 square units."
