-- This is a function that recursively calculates the sum of a list of numbers
-- Parameters:
--     xs - The list of numbers
-- Returns:
--     The sum of the list
sum :: [Int] -> Int
sum [] = 0 -- Base case, empty list has a sum of 0
sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs -- Recursive case, add current number to sum of remaining list

-- This is an example of using the function
-- Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
-- Output: 15
sum [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -- => 15
