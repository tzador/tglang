-- This is a function that calculates the nth term of a Fibonacci sequence
-- Takes in an integer parameter and returns an integer value
-- Uses recursion and pattern matching to compute the Fibonacci sequence
fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0 -- base case when n = 0, returns the first term 
fib 1 = 1 -- base case when n = 1, returns the second term
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2) -- recursive case, uses the previous two terms to compute the current term
