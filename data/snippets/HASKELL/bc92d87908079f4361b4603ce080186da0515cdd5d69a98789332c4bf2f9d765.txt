-- This is a program in Haskell that defines a function called 'factorial' which calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion

factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial n
    | n == 0 = 1     -- base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    | otherwise = n * factorial (n-1) -- recursive case: factorial of n is n multiplied by factorial of n-1

-- To test the factorial function, we call it with a number and print the result
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Enter a number to calculate its factorial"
    num <- getLine
    let result = factorial (read num :: Integer) -- reads input as an Integer
    putStrLn $ "Factorial of " ++ show num ++ " is " ++ show result -- prints the result
