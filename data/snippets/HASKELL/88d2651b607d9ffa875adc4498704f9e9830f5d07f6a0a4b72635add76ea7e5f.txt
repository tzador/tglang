-- This code snippet demonstrates the use of recursive functions to calculate the factorial of a given number

-- Define the factorial function
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial n
    | n == 0 = 1 -- Base case, factorial of 0 is 1
    | otherwise = n * factorial (n - 1) -- Recursive call to calculate factorial

main = do
    -- Get input from user
    putStrLn "Enter a number:"
    numberStr <- getLine
    let number = read numberStr :: Integer -- Convert string input to Integer

    -- Calculate and print the factorial of the input number
    putStrLn ("Factorial of " ++ show number ++ " is: " ++ show (factorial number))
