-- Define a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the average of the positive numbers in the list.
findAverage :: [Int] -> Float
findAverage list = let
   positives = filter (\x -> x > 0) list -- filter out the positive numbers from the list
   sum = foldl (+) 0 positives -- calculate the sum of all positive numbers
   count = foldl (\acc x -> acc + 1) 0 positives -- count the number of positive numbers
   in (fromIntegral sum) / (fromIntegral count) -- calculate and return the average

-- Example call
> findAverage [1, 2, -3, 4, 5, -6]
