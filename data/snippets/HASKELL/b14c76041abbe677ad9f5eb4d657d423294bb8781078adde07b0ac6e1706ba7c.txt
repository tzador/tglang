-- Function to generate the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence using recursion and pattern matching

fibonacci :: Int -> Integer
fibonacci 0 = 0 -- Base case for Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci 1 = 1 -- Base case for Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci n = fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2) -- Recursive function call, adding the previous two numbers in the sequence

main = do
    putStrLn "Enter the number of terms for the Fibonacci sequence:"
    n <- readLn :: IO Int
    let sequence = [fibonacci x | x <- [0..n-1]] -- Generating a list of the first n terms in the Fibonacci sequence
    putStrLn "The Fibonacci sequence is:"
    putStrLn (show sequence) -- Printing the list of Fibonacci numbers
