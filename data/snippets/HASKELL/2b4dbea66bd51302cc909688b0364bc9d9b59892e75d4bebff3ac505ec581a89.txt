-- | Function that takes in a list of integers and returns true if the list is sorted in ascending order
isSorted :: [Int] -> Bool
isSorted [_] = True -- if list has only one element, it is sorted
isSorted (x:y:xs) = x <= y && isSorted (y:xs) -- if first element is smaller or equal to next element, and the rest of the list is sorted, then list is sorted
isSorted _ = False -- if none of the above conditions are met, then list is not sorted
