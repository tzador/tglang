insert :: Ord a => a -> [a] -> [a]  --Function to insert an element into a sorted list.
insert x [] = [x]  --Base case: If the list is empty, just insert the element as the only element in the list.
insert x (y:ys)  --Otherwise, pattern match the non-empty list into its first element (y) and rest of the elements (ys).
  | x <= y = x : y : ys  --If the new element is smaller than or equal to the first element of the list, insert it before the first element.
  | otherwise = y : insert x ys  --If the new element is larger than the first element of the list, recursively call the function on the rest of the elements to find the correct position to insert.
