-- A function that finds the sum of all even numbers in a list
sumEven :: [Int] -> Int
sumEven [] = 0 -- base case for empty list
sumEven (x:xs) | even x = x + sumEven xs -- if x is even, add it to the sum of the rest of the list
               | otherwise = sumEven xs -- if x is odd, skip it and move on to the rest of the list
