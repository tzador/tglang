-- Function to calculate the sum of a list of integers
-- Takes in a list of integers and returns an integer
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList [] = 0  -- Base case: an empty list has a sum of 0
sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs  -- Recursive case: add the first element to the sum of the rest of the list

-- Example usage:
-- sumList [1,2,3,4,5] returns 15 as the sum of the list
-- sumList [] returns 0 since the base case is triggered
