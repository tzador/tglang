-- A function that calculates the mean of a list of numbers
mean :: [Float] -> Float
-- The function takes in a list of Float values and returns a single Float value
-- representing the mean of the given list
mean [] = 0 -- If the list is empty, the mean is 0
mean xs = sum xs / fromIntegral (length xs)
-- The mean is calculated by dividing the sum of the list by the length of the list,
-- using the fromIntegral function to convert the length from Int to Float
